## So what is Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?

Of the innumerable collections of spiritual teachings found in Vedic literature, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa) is considered the topmost. Vedic literature is sometimes said to be a “desire tree,” a tree that can yield whatever one might desire, and of that tree the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam  is said to be the ripe and most relishable fruit.

The Bhāgavatam’s eighteen thousand verses contain hundreds of conversations between self-realized kings, yogis and sages of the ancient world on the subject of how to achieve perfection in life, including descriptions of various incarnations and activities of Kṛṣṇa —the Supreme Person—and His devotees throughout history. It was compiled by Śrīla Vyāsadeva —editor of the Vedas—as his own commentary on Vedānta-sūtra, the essence of all theistic knowledge.

## So what is Bhagavad-gita As It Is?
The *Bhagavad-gita* is universally renowned as the jewel of India's spiritual wisdom. Spoken by Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His intimate disciple Arjuna, the Gita's seven hundred concise verses provide a definitive guide to the science of self realization. No other philosophical or religious work reveals, in such a lucid and profound way, the nature of consciousness, the self, the universe and the Supreme. 

**His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada** is uniquely qualified to present this English translation and commentary on Bhagavad-gita. He is the world's foremost Vedic scholar and teacher, and he is also the current representative of an unbroken chain of fully self-realized spiritual masters begining with Lord Krishna Himself. Thus, unlike other editions of the Gita, this one is presented as it is--without the slightest taint of adulteration or personal motivation. This edition is certain to stimulate and enlighten with its ancient yet thoroughly timely message.

## A brief about Srila Prabhupada
<img align="left" width="160" height="230" src="sriprabhupada.png">

At various times people have called him a scholar, a philosopher, a cultural ambassador, a prolific author, a religious leader, a spiritual teacher, a social critic, and a holy man. In truth, he was all these things and more.

Srila Prabhupada set out to America in 1965 and established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness at the age of sixty-nine. He travelled around the world fourteen times, established more than 100 temples of Krishna and initiated more than 10000 disciples into Krishna consciousness.
