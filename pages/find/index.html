<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dhrtarastra said: O Sanjaya, after assembling in the place of pilgrimage at Kuruksetra, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do, being desirous to fight?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita is the widely read theistic science summarized in the Gita-mahatmya (Glorification of the Gita).</p>
<p>There it says that one should read Bhagavad-gita very scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee of Sri Krsna and try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations.</p>
<p>The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-gita itself, in the way the teaching is understood by Arjuna, who heard the Gita directly from the Lord.</p>
<p>If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-gita in that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world.</p>
<p>One will find in the Bhagavad-gita all that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>That is the specific standard of the Gita.</p>
<p>It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>The topics discussed by Dhrtarastra and Sanjaya, as described in the Mahabharata, form the basic principle for this great philosophy.</p>
<p>It is understood that this philosophy evolved on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, which is a sacred place of pilgrimage from the immemorial time of the Vedic age.</p>
<p>It was spoken by the Lord when He was present personally on this planet for the guidance of mankind.</p>
<p>The word dharma-ksetra (a place where religious rituals are performed) is significant because, on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present on the side of Arjuna.</p>
<p>Dhrtarastra, the father of the Kurus, was highly doubtful about the possibility of his sons' ultimate victory.</p>
<p>In his doubt, he inquired from his secretary Sanjaya, "What did my sons and the sons of Pandu do?" He was confident that both his sons and the sons of his younger brother Pandu were assembled in that Field of Kuruksetra for a determined engagement of the war.</p>
<p>Still, his inquiry is significant.</p>
<p>He did not want a compromise between the cousins and brothers, and he wanted to be sure of the fate of his sons on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Because the battle was arranged to be fought at Kuruksetra, which is mentioned elsewhere in the Vedas as a place of worship--even for the denizens of heaven--Dhrtarastra became very fearful about the influence of the holy place on the outcome of the battle.</p>
<p>He knew very well that this would influence Arjuna and the sons of Pandu favorably, because by nature they were all virtuous.</p>
<p>Sanjaya was a student of Vyasa, and therefore, by the mercy of Vyasa, Sanjaya was able to envision the Battlefield of Kuruksetra even while he was in the room of Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>And so, Dhrtarastra asked him about the situation on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Both the Pandavas and the sons of Dhrtarastra belong to the same family, but Dhrtarastra's mind is disclosed herein.</p>
<p>He deliberately claimed only his sons as Kurus, and he separated the sons of Pandu from the family heritage.</p>
<p>One can thus understand the specific position of Dhrtarastra in his relationship with his nephews, the sons of Pandu.</p>
<p>As in the paddy field the unnecessary plants are taken out, so it is expected from the very beginning of these topics that in the religious field of Kuruksetra where the father of religion, Sri Krsna, was present, the unwanted plants like Dhrtarastra's son Duryodhana and others would be wiped out and the thoroughly religious persons, headed by Yudhisthira, would be established by the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the significance of the words dharma-ksetre and kuru-ksetre, apart from their historical and Vedic importance.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sanjaya said: O King, after looking over the army gathered by the sons of Pandu, King Duryodhana went to his teacher and began to speak the following words:</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Dhrtarastra was blind from birth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was also bereft of spiritual vision.</p>
<p>He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the Pandavas, who were all pious since birth.</p>
<p>Still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, and Sanjaya could understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield.</p>
<p>He wanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent King, and thus he warned him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place.</p>
<p>Sanjaya therefore informed the King that his son, Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the Pandavas, at once went to the commander-in-chief, Dronacarya, to inform him of the real position.</p>
<p>Although Duryodhana is mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>He was therefore quite fit to be a politician.</p>
<p>But Duryodhana's diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the Pandavas.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my teacher, behold the great army of the sons of Pandu, so expertly arranged by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Duryodhana, a great diplomat, wanted to point out the defects of Dronacarya, the great brahmana commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>Dronacarya had some political quarrel with King Drupada, the father of Draupadi, who was Arjuna's wife.</p>
<p>As a result of this quarrel, Drupada performed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dronacarya.</p>
<p>Dronacarya knew this perfectly well, and yet, as a liberal brahmana, he did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son of Drupada, Dhrstadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education.</p>
<p>Now, on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, Dhrstadyumna took the side of the Pandavas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dronacarya.</p>
<p>Duryodhana pointed out this mistake of Dronacarya's so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting.</p>
<p>By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the Pandavas, who were also Dronacarya's affectionate students.</p>
<p>Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student.</p>
<p>Duryodhana also warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat.</p>

<p>Even though Dhrstadyumna was not a very important obstacle in the face of Dronacarya's very great power in the military art, there were many others who were the cause of fear.</p>
<p>They are mentioned by Duryodhana as great stumbling blocks on the path of victory because each and every one of them was as formidable as Bhima and Arjuna.</p>
<p>He knew the strength of Bhima and Arjuna, and thus he compared the others with them.</p>

<p>Herein an estimation of comparative strength is made by Duryodhana.</p>
<p>He thinks that the strength of his armed forces is immeasurable, being specifically protected by the most experienced general, Grandfather Bhisma.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the forces of the Pandavas are limited, being protected by a less experienced general, Bhima, who is like a fig in the presence of Bhisma.</p>
<p>Duryodhana was always envious of Bhima because he knew perfectly well that if he should die at all, he would only be killed by Bhima.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he was confident of his victory on account of the presence of Bhisma, who was a far superior general.</p>
<p>His conclusion that he would come out of the battle victorious was well ascertained.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Now all of you must give full support to Grandfather Bhisma, standing at your respective strategic points in the phalanx of the army.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Duryodhana, after praising the prowess of Bhisma, further considered that others might think that they had been considered less important, so in his usual diplomatic way, he tried to adjust the situation in the above words.</p>
<p>He emphasized that Bhismadeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides.</p>
<p>He might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was important that other heroes would not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx.</p>
<p>Duryodhana clearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bhismadeva.</p>
<p>He was confident of the full support of Bhismadeva and Dronacarya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word when Arjuna's wife Draupadi, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to strip naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly.</p>
<p>Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the Pandavas, he hoped that all such affection would now be completely given up by them, as was customary during the gambling performances.</p>

<p>The grandsire of the Kuru dynasty could understand the inner meaning of the heart of his grandson Duryodhana, and out of his natural compassion for him he tried to cheer him by blowing his conchshell very loudly, befitting his position as a lion.</p>
<p>Indirectly, by the symbolism of the conchshell, he informed his depressed grandson Duryodhana that he had no chance of victory in the battle, because the Supreme Lord Krsna was on the other side.</p>

<p>On the other side, both Lord Krsna and Arjuna, stationed on a great chariot drawn by white horses, sounded their transcendental conchshells.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In contrast with the conchshell blown by Bhismadeva, the conchshells in the hands of Krsna and Arjuna are described as transcendental.</p>
<p>The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because Krsna was on the side of the Pandavas.</p>
<p>Jayas tu pandu-putranam yesam pakse janardanah.</p>
<p>Victory is always with persons like the sons of Pandu because Lord Krsna is associated with them.</p>
<p>And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband.</p>
<p>Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Visnu, or Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated was donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then, Lord Krsna blew His conchshell, called Pancajanya; Arjuna blew his, the Devadatta; and Bhima, the voracious eater and performer of Herculean tasks, blew his terrific conchshell called Paundram.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Krsna is referred to as Hrsikesa in this verse because He is the owner of all senses.</p>
<p>The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and, therefore, the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses.</p>
<p>The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as sense-less, or impersonal.</p>
<p>The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses.</p>
<p>But, He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses.</p>
<p>Here on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra the Lord directly controls the transcendental senses of Arjuna, and thus His particular name of Hrsikesa.</p>
<p>The Lord has different names according to His different activities.</p>
<p>For example, His name is Madhusudana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Vasudeva because He appeared as the son of Vasudeva; His name is Devaki-nandana because He accepted Devaki as His mother; His name is Yasoda-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yasoda at Vrndavana; His name is Partha-sarathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna.</p>
<p>Similarly, His name is Hrsikesa because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>Arjuna is referred to as Dhananjaya in this verse because he helped his elder brother in fetching wealth when it was required by the King to make expenditures for different sacrifices.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bhima is known as Vrkodara because he could eat as voraciously as he could perform Herculean tasks, such as killing the demon Hidimba.</p>
<p>So, the particular types of conchshell blown by the different personalities on the side of the Pandavas, beginning with the Lord's, were all very encouraging to the fighting soldiers.</p>
<p>On the other side there were no such credits, nor the presence of Lord Krsna, the supreme director, nor that of the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p>So, they were predestined to lose the battle--and that was the message announced by the sounds of the conchshells.</p>

<p>The signs already clearly indicated that the whole Kuru dynasty would be killed in that great battle.</p>
<p>Beginning with the grandsire, Bhisma, down to the grandsons like Abhimanyu and others--including kings from many states of the world--all were present there, and all were doomed.</p>

<p>Such occurrences are not mentioned, but in this particular verse it is mentioned that the hearts of the sons of Dhrtarastra were shattered by the sounds vibrated by the Pandavas' party.</p>
<p>This is due to the Pandavas and their confidence in Lord Krsna.</p>

<p>O King, at that time Arjuna, the son of Pandu, who was seated in his chariot, his flag marked with Hanuman, took up his bow and prepared to shoot his arrows, looking at the sons of Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>O King, Arjuna then spoke to Hrsikesa [Krsna] these words:</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The battle was just about to begin.</p>
<p>It is understood from the above statement that the sons of Dhrtarastra were more or less disheartened by the unexpected arrangement of military force by the Pandavas, who were guided by the direct instructions of Lord Krsna on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The emblem of Hanuman on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanuman cooperated with Lord Rama in the battle between Rama and Ravana, and Lord Rama emerged victorious.</p>
<p>Now both Rama and Hanuman were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna is Rama Himself, and wherever Lord Rama is, His eternal servitor Hanuman and His eternal consort Sita, the goddess of fortune, are present.</p>
<p>Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever.</p>
<p>And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord Krsna, was personally present to give him direction.</p>
<p>Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle.</p>
<p>In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend.</p>
<p>He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible.</p>
<p>As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible.</p>
<p>Although He had accepted the position of a charioteer for His devotee, His supreme position was not challenged.</p>
<p>In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hrsikesa, the Lord of the total senses.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental.</p>
<p>The servitor is always ready to render a service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee.</p>
<p>He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee's assuming the advantageous postion of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders.</p>
<p>As master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him.</p>
<p>But when he finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible master of all circumstances.</p>
<p>As a pure devotee of the Lord, Arjuna had no desire to fight with his cousins and brothers, but he was forced to come onto the battlefield by the obstinacy of Duryodhana, who was never agreeable to any peaceful negotiation.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was very anxious to see who the leading persons present on the battlefield were.</p>
<p>Although there was no question of a peacemaking endeavor on the battlefield, he wanted to see them again, and to see how much they were bent upon demanding an unwanted war.</p>

<p>It was an open secret that Duryodhana wanted to usurp the kingdom of the Pandavas by evil plans, in collaboration with his father, Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>Therefore, all persons who had joined the side of Duryodhana must have been birds of the same feather.</p>
<p>Arjuna wanted to see them in the battlefield before the fight was begun, just to learn who they were, but he had no intention of proposing peace negotiations with them.</p>
<p>It was also a fact that he wanted to see them to make an estimate of the strength which he had to face, although he was quite confident of victory because Krsna was sitting by his side.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sanjaya said: O descendant of Bharata, being thus addressed by Arjuna, Lord Krsna drew up the fine chariot in the midst of the armies of both parties.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Gudakesa.</p>
<p>Gudaka means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called gudakesa.</p>
<p>Sleep also means ignorance.</p>
<p>So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with Krsna.</p>
<p>As a great devotee of Krsna, he could not forget Krsna even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee.</p>
<p>Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Krsna's name, form, quality and pastimes.</p>
<p>Thus a devotee of Krsna can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of Krsna constantly.</p>
<p>This is called Krsna consciousness, or samadhi.</p>
<p>As Hrsikesa, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity, Krsna could understand Arjuna's purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies.</p>
<p>Thus He did so, and spoke as follows.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#125" id="125">1.25</a></h3>

<p>As the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord Krsna could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna.</p>
<p>The use of the word Hrsikesa in this connection indicates that He knew everything.</p>
<p>And the word Partha, or the son of Kunti or Prtha, is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna.</p>
<p>As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of Prtha, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna.</p>
<p>Now what did Krsna mean when He told Arjuna to "behold the Kurus"? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? Krsna never expected such things from the son of His aunt Prtha.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: My dear Krsna, seeing my friends and relatives present before me in such a fighting spirit, I feel the limbs of my body quivering and my mouth drying up.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Any man who has genuine devotion to the Lord has all the good qualities which are found in godly persons or in the demigods, whereas the nondevotee, however advanced he may be in material qualifications by education and culture, lacks in godly qualities.</p>
<p>As such, Arjuna, just after seeing his kinsmen, friends and relatives on the battlefield, was at once overwhelmed by compassion for them who had so decided to fight amongst themselves.</p>
<p>As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death.</p>
<p>And so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry.</p>
<p>He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Practically the whole community, all blood relatives of Arjuna, had come to fight with him.</p>
<p>This overwhelmed a kind devotee like Arjuna.</p>
<p>Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only were Arjuna's bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but that he was also crying out of compassion.</p>
<p>Such symptoms in Arjuna were not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>It is said therefore:</p>
<p>yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna mano-rathenasati dhavato bahih</p>
<p>"One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods.</p>
<p>But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value.</p>
<p>This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy." (Bhag.5.18.12)</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My whole body is trembling, and my hair is standing on end.</p>
<p>My bow Gandiva is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two kinds of trembling of the body, and two kinds of standings of the hair on end.</p>
<p>Such phenomena occur either in great spiritual ecstasy or out of great fear under material conditions.</p>
<p>There is no fear in transcendental realization.</p>
<p>Arjuna's symptoms in this situation are out of material fear--namely, loss of life.</p>
<p>This is evident from other symptoms also; he became so impatient that his famous bow Gandiva was slipping from his hands, and, because his heart was burning within him, he was feeling a burning sensation of the skin.</p>
<p>All these are due to a material conception of life.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Due to his impatience, Arjuna was unable to stay on the battlefield, and he was forgetting himself on account of the weakness of his mind.</p>
<p>Excessive attachment for material things puts a man in a bewildering condition of existence.</p>
<p>Bhayam dvitiyabhinivesatah: such fearfulness and loss of mental equilibrium take place in persons who are too affected by material conditions.</p>
<p>Arjuna envisioned only unhappiness in the battlefield--he would not be happy even by gaining victory over the foe.</p>
<p>The word nimitta is significant.</p>
<p>When a man sees only frustration in his expectations, he thinks, "Why am I here?" Everyone is interested in himself and his own welfare.</p>
<p>No one is interested in the Supreme Self.</p>
<p>Arjuna is supposed to show disregard for self-interest by submission to the will of Krsna, who is everyone's real self-interest.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul forgets this, and therefore suffers material pains.</p>
<p>Arjuna thought that his victory in the battle would only be a cause of lamentation for him.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I do not see how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle, nor can I, my dear Krsna, desire any subsequent victory, kingdom, or happiness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Without knowing that one's self-interest is in Visnu (or Krsna), conditioned souls are attracted by bodily relationships, hoping to be happy in such situations.</p>
<p>Under delusion, they forget that Krsna is also the cause of material happiness.</p>
<p>Arjuna appears to have even forgotten the moral codes for a ksatriya.</p>
<p>It is said that two kinds of men, namely the ksatriya who dies directly in front of the battlefield under Krsna's personal orders and the person in the renounced order of life who is absolutely devoted to spiritual culture, are eligible to enter into the sun, which is so powerful and dazzling.</p>
<p>Arjuna is reluctant even to kill his enemies, let alone his relatives.</p>
<p>He thought that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he was not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook.</p>
<p>He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration.</p>
<p>But as a ksatriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the ksatriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation.</p>
<p>But Arjuna has had no kingdom.</p>
<p>Arjuna's sole opportunity for gaining a kingdom lay in fighting with his cousins and brothers and reclaiming the kingdom inherited from his father, which he does not like to do.</p>
<p>Therefore he considers himself fit to go to the forest to live a secluded life of frustration.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Govinda, of what avail to us are kingdoms, happiness or even life itself when all those for whom we may desire them are now arrayed in this battlefield? O Madhusudana, when teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and all relatives are ready to give up their lives and properties and are standing before me, then why should I wish to kill them, though I may survive? O maintainer of all creatures, I am not prepared to fight with them even in exchange for the three worlds, let alone this earth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna has addressed Lord Krsna as Govinda because Krsna is the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses.</p>
<p>By using this significant word, Arjuna indicates what will satisfy his senses.</p>
<p>Although Govinda is not meant for satisfying our senses, if we try to satisfy the senses of Govinda then automatically our own senses are satisfied.</p>
<p>Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet.</p>
<p>But when one takes the opposite way--namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses of Govinda without desiring to satisfy one's own senses--then by the grace of Govinda all desires of the living entity are satisfied.</p>
<p>Arjuna's deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them.</p>
<p>He is therefore not prepared to fight.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, but Arjuna fears that all his relatives and friends will be killed in the battlefield, and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory.</p>
<p>This is a typical calculation of material life.</p>
<p>The transcendental life is, however, different.</p>
<p>Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing.</p>
<p>Arjuna did not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired that Krsna kill them personally.</p>
<p>At this point he did not know that Krsna had already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument for Krsna.</p>
<p>This fact is disclosed in following chapters.</p>
<p>As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord's plan that they should all be killed.</p>
<p>The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants.</p>
<p>The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sin will overcome us if we slay such aggressors.</p>
<p>Therefore it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra and our friends.</p>
<p>What should we gain, O Krsna, husband of the goddess of fortune, and how could we be happy by killing our own kinsmen?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Vedic injunctions there are six kinds of aggressors: 1) a poison giver, 2) one who sets fire to the house, 3) one who attacks with deadly weapons, 4) one who plunders riches, 5) one who occupies another's land, and 6) one who kidnaps a wife.</p>
<p>Such aggressors are at once to be killed, and no sin is incurred by killing such aggressors.</p>
<p>Such killing of aggressors is quite befitting for any ordinary man, but Arjuna was not an ordinary person.</p>
<p>He was saintly by character, and therefore he wanted to deal with them in saintliness.</p>
<p>This kind of saintliness, however, is not for a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Although a responsible man in the administration of a state is required to be saintly, he should not be cowardly.</p>
<p>For example, Lord Rama was so saintly that people were anxious to live in His kingdom, (Rama-rajya), but Lord Rama never showed any cowardice.</p>
<p>Ravana was an aggressor against Rama because he kidnapped Rama's wife, Sita, but Lord Rama gave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world.</p>
<p>In Arjuna's case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc.</p>
<p>Because of them, Arjuna thought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors.</p>
<p>Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive.</p>
<p>Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency.</p>
<p>Arjuna considered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior.</p>
<p>He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness.</p>
<p>After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen? Arjuna's addressing of Krsna as "Madhava," or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection.</p>
<p>He wanted to point out to Krsna that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not have to induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune.</p>
<p>Krsna, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees.</p>

<p>A ksatriya is not supposed to refuse to battle or gamble when he is so invited by some rival party.</p>
<p>Under such obligation, Arjuna could not refuse to fight because he was challenged by the party of Duryodhana.</p>
<p>In this connection, Arjuna considered that the other party might be blind to the effects of such a challenge.</p>
<p>Arjuna, however, could see the evil consequences and could not accept the challenge.</p>

<p>In the system of the varnasrama institution there are many principles of religious traditions to help members of the family grow properly and attain spiritual values.</p>
<p>The elder members are responsible for such purifying processes in the family, beginning from birth to death.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Krsna, the women of the family become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrsni, comes unwanted progeny.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life.</p>
<p>The varnasrama religion's principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community.</p>
<p>Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood.</p>
<p>As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation.</p>
<p>Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family.</p>
<p>By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery.</p>
<p>According to Canakya Pandit, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy.</p>
<p>So, the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in the varnasrama system.</p>
<p>On the failure of such varnasrama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population.</p>
<p>Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the rules and regulations of fruitive activities, there is a need to offer periodical food and water to the forefathers of the family.</p>
<p>This offering is performed by worship of Visnu, because eating the remnants of food offered to Visnu can deliver one from all kinds of sinful actions.</p>
<p>Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts.</p>
<p>Thus, when remnants of prasadam food are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life.</p>
<p>Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals.</p>
<p>One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions.</p>
<p>Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Bhagavatam:</p>
<p>devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam na kinkaro nayamrni ca rajan sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam gato mukundam parihrtya kartam</p>
<p>"Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of liberation, giving up all kinds of obligation, and has taken to the path in all seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general living entities, family members, humankind or forefathers." (Bhag.11.5.41) Such obligations are automatically fulfilled by performance of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sanjaya said: Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusudana, Krsna, spoke the following words.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material compassion, lamentation and tears are all signs of ignorance of the real self.</p>
<p>Compassion for the eternal soul is self-realization.</p>
<p>The word "Madhusudana" is significant in this verse.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna killed the demon Madhu, and now Arjuna wanted Krsna to kill the demon of misunderstanding that had overtaken him in the discharge of his duty.</p>
<p>No one knows where compassion should be applied.</p>
<p>Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless.</p>
<p>A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress--the gross material body.</p>
<p>One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called a sudra, or one who laments unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Arjuna was a ksatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-gita was sung by Him.</p>
<p>This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>This realization is made possible by working with the fruitive being situated in the fixed conception of the real self.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Person [Bhagavan] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life.</p>
<p>They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Krsna is referred to as "Bhagavan" throughout the Gita.</p>
<p>Bhagavan is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman or the impersonal all-pervasive spirit; Paramatma, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:</p>
<p>vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate.</p>
<p>"The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical.</p>
<p>Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan." (Bhag.1.2.11) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun's surface and the sun planet itself.</p>
<p>One who studies the sunshine only is the preliminary student.</p>
<p>One who understands the sun's surface is further advanced.</p>
<p>And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest.</p>
<p>Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine--its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature--may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramatma feature of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bhaktas, or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavan feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter.</p>
<p>The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word Bhagavan is explained by the great authority, Parasara Muni, the father of Vyasadeva.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavan.</p>
<p>There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely.</p>
<p>Only Krsna can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>No living entity, including Brahma, Lord Siva, or Narayana, can possess opulences as fully as Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-samhita by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>No one is equal to or above Him.</p>
<p>He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavan, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.</p>
<p>isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah anadir adir govindah sarua-karana-karanam</p>
<p>"There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavan, but Krsna is the supreme because none can excel Him.</p>
<p>He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss.</p>
<p>He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes." (Brahma-samhita 5.1)</p>
<p>In the Bhagavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krsna is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:</p>
<p>ete camsa-kalah pumsah krsnas tu bhagavan svayam indrari-vyakulam lokam mrdayanti yuge yuge</p>
<p>"All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself." (Bhag.1.3.28)</p>
<p>Therefore, Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Krsna expressed His surprise with the word kutas, "wherefrom."</p>
<p>Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Aryans.</p>
<p>The word aryan is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Visnu, or Bhagavan, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is.</p>
<p>Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Aryans.</p>
<p>Although Arjuna was a ksatriya, he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight.</p>
<p>This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Aryans.</p>
<p>Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen.</p>

<p>It does not become you.</p>
<p>Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna was addressed as the "son of Prtha," who happened to be the sister of Krsna's father Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna had a blood relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>If the son of a ksatriya declines to fight, he is a ksatriya in name only, and if the son of a brahmana acts impiously, he is a brahmana in name only.</p>
<p>Such ksatriyas and brahmanas are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore, Krsna did not want Arjuna to become an unworthy son of a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Arjuna was the most intimate friend of Krsna, and Krsna was directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, if Arjuna abandoned the battle, he would be committing an infamous act; therefore Krsna said that such an attitude in Arjuna did not fit his personality.</p>
<p>Arjuna might argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectable Bhisma and his relatives, but Krsna considered that sort of magnanimity not approved by authority.</p>
<p>Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons like Arjuna under the direct guidance of Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Respectable superiors like Bhisma the grandfather and Dronacarya the teacher are always worshipable.</p>
<p>Even if they attack, they should not be counterattacked.</p>
<p>It is general etiquette that superiors are not to be offered even a verbal fight.</p>
<p>Even if they are sometimes harsh in behavior, they should not be harshly treated.</p>
<p>Then, how is it possible for Arjuna to counterattack them? Would Krsna ever attack His own grandfather, Ugrasena, or His teacher, Sandipani Muni? These were some of the arguments by Arjuna to Krsna.</p>

<p>Even though they are avaricious, they are nonetheless superiors.</p>
<p>If they are killed, our spoils will be tainted with blood.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to scriptural codes, a teacher who engages in an abominable action and has lost his sense of discrimination is fit to be abandoned.</p>
<p>Bhisma and Drona were obliged to take the side of Duryodhana because of his financial assistance, although they should not have accepted such a position simply on financial considerations.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, they have lost the respectability of teachers.</p>
<p>But Arjuna thinks that nevertheless they remain his superiors, and therefore to enjoy material profits after killing them would mean to enjoy spoils tainted with blood.</p>

<p>Nor do we know which is better--conquering them or being conquered by them.</p>
<p>The sons of Dhrtarastra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now standing before us on this battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna did not know whether he should fight and risk unnecessary violence, although fighting is the duty of the ksatriyas, or whether he should refrain and live by begging.</p>
<p>If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence.</p>
<p>Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious.</p>
<p>Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons of Dhrtarastra died in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them.</p>
<p>All these considerations by Arjuna definitely prove that he was not only a great devotee of the Lord but that he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses.</p>
<p>His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment.</p>
<p>He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction of Sri Krsna (his spiritual master), indicate.</p>
<p>It is concluded that Arjuna was quite fit for liberation.</p>
<p>Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation.</p>
<p>Arjuna was competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By nature's own way the complete system of material activities is a source of perplexity for everyone.</p>
<p>In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life.</p>
<p>All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life which happen without our desire.</p>
<p>They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone.</p>
<p>Similarly, the world situation is such that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion.</p>
<p>No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed.</p>
<p>The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master.</p>
<p>This is the purport of this verse.</p>
<p>Who is the man in material perplexities? It is he who does not understand the problems of life.</p>
<p>In the Garga Upanisad the perplexed man is described as follows:</p>
<p>yo va etad aksaram gargy aviditvasmal lokat praiti sa krpanah</p>
<p>"He is a miserly man who does not solve the problems of life as a human and who thus quits this world like the cats and dogs, without understanding the science of self-realization."</p>
<p>This human form of life is a most valuable asset for the living entity who can ultilize it for solving the problems of life; therefore, one who does not utilize this opportunity properly is a miser.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is the brahmana, or he who is intelligent enough to utilize this body to solve all the problems of life.</p>
<p>The krpanas, or miserly persons, waste their time in being overly affectionate for family, society, country, etc., in the material conception of life.</p>
<p>One is often attached to family life, namely to wife, children and other members, on the basis of "skin disease."</p>
<p>The krpana thinks that he is able to protect his family members from death; or the krpana thinks that his family or society can save him from the verge of death.</p>
<p>Such family attachment can be found even in the lower animals who take care of children also.</p>
<p>Being intelligent, Arjuna could understand that his affection for family members and his wish to protect them from death were the causes ot his perplexities.</p>
<p>Although he could understand that his duty to fight was awaiting him, still, on account of miserly weakness, he could not discharge the duties.</p>
<p>He is therefore asking Lord Krsna, the supreme spiritual master, to make a definite solution.</p>
<p>He offers himself to Krsna as a disciple.</p>
<p>He wants to stop friendly talks.</p>
<p>Talks between the master and the disciple are serious, and now Arjuna wants to talk very seriously before the recognized spiritual master.</p>
<p>Krsna is therefore the original spiritual master of the science of Bhagavad-gita, and Arjuna is the first disciple for understanding the Gita.</p>
<p>How Arjuna understands the Bhagavad-gita is stated in the Gita itself.</p>
<p>And yet foolish mundane scholars explain that one need not submit to Krsna as a person, but to "the unborn within Krsna."</p>
<p>There is no difference between Krsna's within and without.</p>
<p>And one who has no sense of this understanding is the greatest fool in trying to understand Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses.</p>
<p>I will not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth with sovereignty like the demigods in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna was putting forward so many arguments based on knowledge of the principles of religion and moral codes, it appears that he was unable to solve his real problem without the help of the spiritual master, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>He could understand that his so-called knowledge was useless in driving away his problems, which were drying up his whole existence; and it was impossible for him to solve such perplexities without the help of a spiritual master like Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Academic knowledge, scholarship, high position, etc., are all useless in solving the problems of life; help can only be given by a spiritual master like Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion is that a spiritual master who is one hundred percent Krsna conscious is the bona fide spiritual master, for he can solve the problems of life.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya said that one who is master in the science of Krsna consciousness, regardless of his social position, is the real spiritual master.</p>
<p>kibavipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya yei krsna-tattva-vetta, sei 'guru' haya. (Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya 8.128)</p>
<p>"It does not matter whether a person is a vipra [learned scholar in Vedic wisdom] or is born in a lower family, or is in the renounced order of life--if he is master in the science of Krsna, he is the perfect and bona fide spiritual master."</p>
<p>So without being a master in the science of Krsna consciousness, no one is a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>It is also said in Vedic literatures:</p>
<p>sat-karma-nipuno vipro mantra-tantra-visaradah avaisnavo gurur na syad vaisnavah svapaco guruh</p>
<p>"A scholarly brahmana, expert in all subjects of Vedic knowledge, is unfit to become a spiritual master without being a Vaisnava, or expert in the science of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>But a person born in a family of a lower caste can become a spiritual master if he is a Vaisnava, or Krsna conscious."</p>
<p>The problems of material existence--birth, old age, disease and death--cannot be counteracted by accumulation of wealth and economic development.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world there are states which are replete with all facilities of life, which are full of wealth, and economically developed, yet the problems of material existence are still present.</p>
<p>They are seeking peace in different ways, but they ean achieve real happiness only if they consult Krsna, or the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam--which constitute the science of Krsna--or the bona fide representative of Krsna, the man in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If economic development and material comforts could drive away one's lamentations for family, social, national or international inebrieties, then Arjuna would not have said that even an unrivalled kingdom on earth or supremacy like that of the demigods in the heavenly planets would not be able to drive away his lamentations.</p>
<p>He sought, therefore, refuge in Krsna consciousness, and that is the right path for peace and harmony.</p>
<p>Economic development or supremacy over the world can be finished at any moment by the cataclysms of material nature.</p>
<p>Even elevation into a higher planetary situation, as men are now seeking a place on the moon planet, can also be finished at one stroke.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita confirms this: ksine punye martyalokam visanti "When the results of pious activities are finished, one falls down again from the peak of happiness to the lowest status of life."</p>
<p>Many politicians of the world have fallen down in that way.</p>
<p>Such downfalls only constitute more causes for lamentation.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to curb lamentation for good, then we have to take shelter of Krsna, as Arjuna is seeking to do.</p>
<p>So Arjuna asked Krsna to solve his problem definitely, and that is the way of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>Dhrtarastra must have been very glad to understand that Arjuna was not going to fight and was instead leaving the battlefield for the begging profession.</p>
<p>But Sanjaya disappointed him again in relating that Arjuna was competent to kill his enemies (parantapah).</p>
<p>Although Arjuna was for the time being overwhelmed with false grief due to family affection, he surrendered unto Krsna, the supreme spiritual master, as a disciple.</p>
<p>This indicated that he would soon be free from the false lamentation resulting from family affection and would be enlightened with perfect knowledge of self-realization, or Krsna consciousness, and would then surely fight.</p>
<p>Thus Dhrtarastra's joy would be frustrated, since Arjuna would be enlightened by Krsna and would fight to the end.</p>

<p>O descendant of Bharata, at that time Krsna, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the Hrsikesa and the Gudakesa.</p>
<p>As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other.</p>
<p>Krsna was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple.</p>
<p>As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord accepts one who wishes to be a friend, a son, a lover or a devotee, or who wants Him in such a role.</p>
<p>But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master--with gravity, as it is required.</p>
<p>It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefitted.</p>
<p>So the talks of Bhagavad-gita are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief.</p>
<p>Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord at once took the position of the teacher and chastised the student, calling him, indirectly, a fool.</p>
<p>The Lord said, you are talking like a learned man, but you do not know that one who is learned--one who knows what is body and what is soul--does not lament for any stage of the body, neither in the living nor in the dead condition.</p>
<p>As it will be explained in later chapters, it will be clear that knowledge means to know matter and spirit and the controller of both.</p>
<p>Arjuna argued that religious principles should be given more importance than politics or sociology, but he did not know that knowledge of matter, soul and the Supreme is even more important than religious formularies.</p>
<p>And, because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man.</p>
<p>As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation.</p>
<p>The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul.</p>
<p>One who knows this is actually learned, and for him there is no cause for lamentation, regardless of the condition of the material body.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Vedas, in the Katha Upanisad as well as in the Svetasvatara Upanisad, it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the maintainer of innumerable living entities, in terms of their different situations according to individual work and reaction of work.</p>
<p>That Supreme Personality of Godhead is also, by His plenary portions, alive in the heart of every living entity.</p>
<p>Only saintly persons who can see, within and without, the same Supreme Lord, can actually attain to perfect and eternal peace.</p>
<p>nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman tam atmastham ye 'nupasyanti dhiras tesam santih sasvati netaresam. (Katha 2.2.13)</p>
<p>The same Vedic truth given to Arjuna is given to all persons in the world who pose themselves as very learned but factually have but a poor fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Lord says clearly that He Himself, Arjuna, and all the kings who are assembled on the battlefield, are eternally individual beings and that the Lord is eternally the maintainer of the individual living entities both in their conditioned as well as in their liberated situations.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme individual person, and Arjuna, the Lord's eternal associate, and all the kings assembled there are individual, eternal persons.</p>
<p>It is not that they did not exist as individuals in the past, and it is not that they will not remain eternal persons.</p>
<p>Their individuality existed in the past, and their individuality will continue in the future without interruption.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no cause for lamentation for anyone.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi theory that after liberation the individual soul, separated by the covering of maya or illusion, will merge into the impersonal Brahman and lose its individual existence is not supported herein by Lord Krsna, the supreme authority.</p>
<p>Nor is the theory that we only think of individuality in the conditioned state supported herein.</p>
<p>Krsna clearly says herein that in the future also the individuality of the Lord and others, as it is confirmed in the Upanisads, will continue eternally.</p>
<p>This statement of Krsna is authoritative because Krsna cannot be subject to illusion.</p>
<p>If individuality is not a fact, then Krsna would not have stressed it so much--even for the future.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi may argue that the individuality spoken of by Krsna is not spiritual, but material.</p>
<p>Even accepting the argument that the individuality is material, then how can one distinguish Krsna's individuality? Krsna affirms His individuality in the past and confirms His individuality in the future also.</p>
<p>He has confirmed His individuality in many ways, and impersonal Brahman has been declared to be subordinate to Him.</p>
<p>Krsna has maintained spiritual individuality all along; if He is accepted as an ordinary conditioned soul in individual consciousness, then His Bhagavad-gita has no value as authoritative scripture.</p>
<p>A common man with all the four defects of human frailty is unable to teach that which is worth hearing.</p>
<p>The Gita is above such literature.</p>
<p>No mundane book compares with the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>When one accepts Krsna as an ordinary man, the Gita loses all importance.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi argues that the plurality mentioned in this verse is conventional and that it refers to the body.</p>
<p>But previous to this verse such a bodily conception is already condemned.</p>
<p>After condemning the bodily conception of the living entities, how was it possible for Krsna to place a conventional proposition on the body again? Therefore, individuality is maintained on spiritual grounds and is thus confirmed by great acaryas like Sri Ramanuja and others.</p>
<p>It is clearly mentioned in many places in the Gita that this spiritual individuality is understood by those who are devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who are envious of Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no bona fide access to the great literature.</p>
<p>The nondevotee's approach to the teachings of the Gita is something like bees licking on a bottle of honey.</p>
<p>One cannot have a taste of honey unless one opens the bottle.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mysticism of the Bhagavad-gita can be understood only by devotees, and no one else can taste it, as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter of the book.</p>
<p>Nor can the Gita be touched by persons who envy the very existence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Mayavadi explanation of the Gita is a most misleading presentation of the whole truth.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya has forbidden us to read commentations made by the Mayavadis and warns that one who takes to such an understanding of the Mayavadi philosophy loses all power to understand the real mystery of the Gita.</p>
<p>If individuality refers to the empirical universe, then there is no need of teaching by the Lord.</p>
<p>The plurality of the individual soul and of the Lord is an eternal fact, and it is confirmed by the Vedas as above mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since every living entity is an individual soul, each is changing his body every moment, manifesting sometimes as a child, sometimes as a youth, and sometimes as an old man.</p>
<p>Yet the same spirit soul is there and does not undergo any change.</p>
<p>This individual soul finally changes the body at death and transmigrates to another body; and since it is sure to have another body in the next birth--either material or spiritual--there was no cause for lamentation by Arjuna on account of death, neither for Bhisma nor for Drona, for whom he was so much concerned.</p>
<p>Rather, he should rejoice for their changing bodies from old to new ones, thereby rejuvenating their energy.</p>
<p>Such changes of body account for varieties of enjoyment or suffering, according to one's work in life.</p>
<p>So Bhisma and Drona, being noble souls, were surely going to have either spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence.</p>
<p>So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation.</p>
<p>Any man who has perfect knowledge of the constitution of the individual soul, the Supersoul, and nature--both material and spiritual--is called a dhira or a most sober man.</p>
<p>Such a man is never deluded by the change of bodies.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi theory of oneness of the spirit soul cannot be entertained on the ground that spirit soul cannot be cut into pieces as a fragmental portion.</p>
<p>Such cutting into different individual souls would make the Supreme cleavable or changeable, against the principle of the Supreme Soul being unchangeable.</p>
<p>As confirmed in the Gita, the fragmental portions of the Supreme exist eternally (sanatana) and are called ksara; that is, they have a tendency to fall down into material nature.</p>
<p>These fragmental portions are eternally so, and even after liberation, the individual soul remains the same--fragmental.</p>
<p>But once liberated, he lives an eternal life in bliss and knowledge with the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The theory of reflection can be applied to the Supersoul who is present in each and every individual body and is known as the Paramatma, who is different from the individual living entity.</p>
<p>When the sky is reflected in water, the reflections represent both the sun and the moon and the stars also.</p>
<p>The stars can be compared to the living entities and the sun or the moon to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The individual fragmental spirit soul is represented by Arjuna, and the Supreme Soul is the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>They are not on the same level, as it will be apparent in the beginning of the Fourth Chapter.</p>
<p>If Arjuna is on the same level with Krsna, and Krsna is not superior to Arjuna, then their relationship of instructor and instructed becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>If both of them are deluded by the illusory energy (maya), then there is no need of one being the instructor and the other the instructed.</p>
<p>Such instruction would be useless because, in the clutches of maya, no one can be an authoritative instructor.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, it is admitted that Lord Krsna is the Supreme Lord, superior in position to the living entity, Arjuna, who is a forgotten soul deluded by maya.</p>

<p>O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.</p>
<p>They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the proper discharge of duty, one has to learn to tolerate nonpermanent appearances and disappearances of happiness and distress.</p>
<p>According to Vedic injunction, one has to take his bath early in the morning even during the month of Magha (January-February).</p>
<p>It is very cold at that time, but in spite of that a man who abides by the religious principles does not hesitate to take his bath.</p>
<p>Similarly, a woman does not hesitate to cook in the kitchen in the months of May and June, the hottest part of the summer season.</p>
<p>One has to execute his duty in spite of climatic inconveniences.</p>
<p>Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the ksatriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty.</p>
<p>One has to follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of knowledge because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches of maya (illusion).</p>
<p>The two different names of address given to Arjuna are also significant.</p>
<p>To address him as Kaunteya signifies his great blood relations from his mother's side; and to address him as Bharata signifies his greatness from his father's side.</p>
<p>From both sides he is supposed to have a great heritage.</p>
<p>A great heritage brings responsibility in the matter of proper discharge of duties; therefore, he cannot avoid fighting.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who is steady in his determination for the advanced stage of spiritual realization and can equally tolerate the onslaughts of distress and happiness is certainly a person eligible for liberation.</p>
<p>In the varnasrama institution, the fourth stage of life, namely the renounced order (sannyasa) is a painstaking situation.</p>
<p>But one who is serious about making his life perfect surely adopts the sannyasa order of life in spite of all difficulties.</p>
<p>The difficulties usually arise from having to sever family relationships, to give up the connection of wife and children.</p>
<p>But if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Arjuna's discharge of duties as a ksatriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya took sannyasa at the age of twenty-four, and His dependants, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them.</p>
<p>Yet for a higher cause He took sannyasa and was steady in the discharge of higher duties.</p>
<p>That is the way of achieving liberation from material bondage.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is no endurance of the changing body.</p>
<p>That the body is changing every moment by the actions and reactions of the different cells is admitted by modern medical science; and thus growth and old age are taking place in the body.</p>
<p>But the spirit soul exists permanently, remaining the same despite all changes of the body and the mind.</p>
<p>That is the difference between matter and spirit.</p>
<p>By nature, the body is ever changing, and the soul is eternal.</p>
<p>This conclusion is established by all classes of seers of the truth, both impersonalist and personalist.</p>
<p>In the Visnu Purana it is stated that Visnu and His abodes all have self-illuminated spiritual existence.</p>
<p>"Jyotimsi visnur bhavanani visnuh."</p>
<p>The words existent and nonexistent refer only to spirit and matter.</p>
<p>That is the version of all seers of truth.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the instruction by the Lord to the living entities who are bewildered by the influence of ignorance.</p>
<p>Removal of ignorance involves the reestablishment of the eternal relationship between the worshiper and the worshipable and the consequent understanding of the difference between the part and parcel living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One can understand the nature of the Supreme by thorough study of oneself, the difference between oneself and the Supreme being understood as the relationship between the part and the whole.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutras, as well as in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Supreme has been accepted as the origin of all emanations.</p>
<p>Such emanations are experienced by superior and inferior natural sequences.</p>
<p>The living entities belong to the superior nature, as it will be revealed in the Seventh Chapter.</p>
<p>Although there is no difference between the energy and the energetic, the energetic is accepted as the Supreme, and energy or nature is accepted as the subordinate.</p>
<p>The living entities, therefore, are always subordinate to the Supreme Lord, as in the case of the master and the servant, or the teacher and the taught.</p>
<p>Such clear knowledge is impossible to understand under the spell of ignorance, and to drive away such ignorance the Lord teaches the Bhagavad-gita for the enlightenment of all living entities for all time.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Know that which pervades the entire body is indestructible.</p>
<p>No one is able to destroy the imperishable soul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body.</p>
<p>Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness.</p>
<p>Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole.</p>
<p>This spreading of consciousness is limited within one's own body.</p>
<p>The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another.</p>
<p>Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived as individual consciousness.</p>
<p>This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size.</p>
<p>The Svetasvatara Upanisad confirms this:</p>
<p>balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca Bhag.jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate.</p>
<p>"When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet.5.9)</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated:</p>
<p>kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah</p>
<p>"There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair."</p>
<p>Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable.</p>
<p>This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body.</p>
<p>This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul.</p>
<p>Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration.</p>
<p>Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul.</p>
<p>In the Mundaka Upanisad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:</p>
<p>eso 'nuratma cetasa veditavyo yasmin pranah pancadha samvivesa pranais cittam sarvam otam prajanam yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty esa atma.</p>
<p>"The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence.</p>
<p>This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [prana, apana, vyana, samana and udana], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities.</p>
<p>When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited." (Mund.3.1.9)</p>
<p>The hatha-yoga system is meant for controlling the five kinds of air encircling the pure soul by different kinds of sitting postures--not for any material profit, but for liberation of the minute soul from the entanglement of the material atmosphere.</p>
<p>So the constitution of the atomic soul is admitted in all Vedic literatures, and it is also actually felt in the practical experience of any sane man.</p>
<p>Only the insane man can think of this atomic soul as all-pervading Visnu-tattva.</p>
<p>The influence of the atomic soul can be spread all over a particular body.</p>
<p>According to the Mundaka Upanisad, this atomic soul is situated in the heart of every living entity, and because the measurement of the atomic soul is beyond the power of appreciation of the material scientists, some of them assert foolishly that there is no soul.</p>
<p>The individual atomic soul is definitely there in the heart along with the Supersoul, and thus all the energies of bodily movement are emanating from this part of the body.</p>
<p>The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather energy from the soul.</p>
<p>When the soul passes away from this position, activity of the blood, generating fusion, ceases.</p>
<p>Medical science accepts the importance of the red corpuscles, but it cannot ascertain that the source of the energy is the soul.</p>
<p>Medical science, however, does admit that the heart is the seat of all energies of the body.</p>
<p>Such atomic particles of the spirit whole are compared to the sunshine molecules.</p>
<p>In the sunshine there are innumerable radiant molecules.</p>
<p>Similarly, the fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord are atomic sparks of the rays of the Supreme Lord, called by the name prabha or superior energy.</p>
<p>Neither Vedic knowledge nor modern science denies the existence of the spirit soul in the body, and the science of the soul is explicitly described in the Bhagavad-gita by the Personality of Godhead Himself.</p>

<p>It may perish immediately, or it may do so after a hundred years.</p>
<p>It is a question of time only.</p>
<p>There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely.</p>
<p>But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension.</p>
<p>So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation because the living entity can neither be killed as he is, nor can the material body, which cannot be saved for any length of time, be permanently protected.</p>
<p>The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized.</p>

<p>As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body.</p>
<p>As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body.</p>

<p>The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die.</p>
<p>Anything which has birth also has death.</p>
<p>And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future.</p>
<p>He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval--that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being.</p>
<p>Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul.</p>
<p>The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does.</p>
<p>The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth.</p>
<p>The changes of the body do not affect the soul.</p>
<p>The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material.</p>
<p>The soul has no by-product either.</p>
<p>The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man.</p>
<p>The body develops because of the soul's presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change.</p>
<p>Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body.</p>
<p>In the Katha Upanisad also we find a similar passage which reads:</p>
<p>na jayate mriyate va vipascin nayam kutascin na vibhuva kascit ajo nityah sasvato 'yam purano na hanyate hanyamane sarire. (Katha 1.2.18)</p>
<p>The meaning and purport of this verse is the same as in the Bhagavad-gita, but here in this verse there is one special word, vipascit, which means learned or with knowledge.</p>
<p>The soul is full of knowledge, or full always with consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore, consciousness is the symptom of the soul.</p>
<p>Even if one does not find the soul within the heart, where he is situated, one can still understand the presence of the soul simply by the presence of consciousness.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do not find the sun in the sky owing to clouds, or for some other reason, but the light of the sun is always there, and we are convinced that it is therefore daytime.</p>
<p>As soon as there is a little light in the sky early in the morning, we can understand that the sun is in the sky.</p>
<p>Similarly, since there is some consciousness in all bodies--whether man or animal--we can understand the presence of the soul.</p>
<p>This consciousness of the soul is, however, different from the consciousness of the Supreme because the supreme consciousness is all-knowledge--past, present and future.</p>
<p>The consciousness of the individual soul is prone to be forgetful.</p>
<p>When he is forgetful of his real nature, he obtains education and enlightenment from the superior lessons of Krsna.</p>
<p>But Krsna is not like the forgetful soul.</p>
<p>If so, Krsna's teachings of Bhagavad-gita would be useless.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of souls--namely the minute particle soul (anu-atma) and the Supersoul (the vibhu-atma).</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in the Katha Upanisad in this way:</p>
<p>anor aniyan mahato mahiyan atmasya jantor nihito guhayam tam akratuh pasyati vita-soko dhatuh prasadan mahimanam atmanah (Katha 1.2.20)</p>
<p>"Both the Supersoul [Paramatma] and the atomic soul [jivatma] are situated on the same tree of the body within the same heart of the living being, and only one who has become free from all material desires as well as lamentations can, by the grace of the Supreme, understand the glories of the soul."</p>
<p>Krsna is the fountainhead of the Supersoul also, as it will be disclosed in the following chapters, and Arjuna is the atomic soul, forgetful of his real nature; therefore he requires to be enlightened by Krsna, or by His bona fide representative (the spiritual master).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Partha, how can a person who knows that the soul is indestructible, unborn, eternal and immutable, kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Everything has its proper utility, and a man who is situated in complete knowledge knows how and where to apply a thing for its proper utility.</p>
<p>Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge.</p>
<p>Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice.</p>
<p>In Manu-samhita, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the king's punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial.</p>
<p>Similarly, when Krsna orders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and, as such, Arjuna should follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting for Krsna, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted.</p>
<p>A surgical operation is not meant to kill the patient, but to cure him.</p>
<p>Therefore the fighting to be executed by Arjuna at the instruction of Krsna is with full knowledge, so there is no possibility of sinful reaction.</p>

<p>Change of body by the atomic individual soul is an accepted fact.</p>
<p>Even some of the modern scientists who do not believe in the existence of the soul, but at the same time cannot explain the source of energy from the heart, have to accept continuous changes of body which appear from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and again from youth to old age.</p>
<p>From old age, the change is transferred to another body.</p>
<p>This has already been explained in the previous verse.</p>
<p>Transference of the atomic individual soul to another body is made possible by the grace of the Supersoul. The Supersoul fulfills the desire of the atomic soul as one friend fulfills the desire of another.</p>
<p>The Vedas, like the Mundaka Upanisad, as well as the Svetasvatara Upanisad, compare the soul and the Supersoul to two friendly birds sitting on the same tree.</p>
<p>One of the birds (the individual atomic soul) is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other bird (Krsna) is simply watching His friend.</p>
<p>Of these two birds--although they are the same in quality--one is captivated by the fruits of the material tree, while the other is simply witnessing the activities of His friend.</p>
<p>Krsna is the witnessing bird, and Arjuna is the eating bird.</p>
<p>Although they are friends, one is still the master and the other is the servant.</p>
<p>Forgetfulness of this relationship by the atomic soul is the cause of one's changing his position from one tree to another or from one body to another.</p>
<p>The jiva soul is struggling very hard on the tree of the material body, but as soon as he agrees to accept the other bird as the supreme spiritual master--as Arjuna agreed to do by voluntary surrender unto Krsna for instruction--the subordinate bird immediately becomes free from all lamentations.</p>
<p>Both the Katha Upanisad and Svetasvatara Upanisad confirm this:</p>
<p>samane vrkse puruso nimagno 'nisaya socati muhyamanah justam yada pasyaty anyam isam asya mahimanam iti vita-sokah</p>
<p>"Although the two birds are in the same tree, the eating bird is fully engrossed with anxiety and moroseness as the enjoyer of the fruits of the tree.</p>
<p>But if in some way or other he turns his face to his friend who is the Lord and knows His glories--at once the suffering bird becomes free from all anxieties."</p>
<p>Arjuna has now turned his face towards his eternal friend, Krsna, and is understanding the Bhagavad-gita from Him.</p>
<p>And thus, hearing from Krsna, he can understand the supreme glories of the Lord and be free from lamentation.</p>
<p>Arjuna is advised herewith by the Lord not to lament for the bodily change of his old grandfather and his teacher.</p>
<p>He should rather be happy to kill their bodies in the righteous fight so that they may be cleansed at once of all reactions from various bodily activities.</p>
<p>One who lays down his life on the sacrificial altar, or in the proper battlefield, is at once cleansed of bodily reactions and promoted to a higher status of life.</p>
<p>So there was no cause for Arjuna's lamentation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The soul can never be cut into pieces by any weapon, nor can he be burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All kinds of weapons, swords, flames, rains, tornadoes, etc., are unable to kill the spirit soul.</p>
<p>It appears that there were many kinds of weapons made of earth, water, air, ether, etc., in addition to the modern weapons of fire.</p>
<p>Even the nuclear weapons of the modern age are classified as fire weapons, but formerly there were other weapons made of all different types of material elements.</p>
<p>Firearms were counteracted by water weapons, which are now unknown to modern science.</p>
<p>Nor do modern scientists have knowledge of tornado weapons.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the soul can never be cut into pieces, nor annihilated by any number of weapons, regardless of scientific devices.</p>
<p>Nor was it ever possible to cut the individual souls from the original Soul.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi, however, cannot describe how the individual soul evolved from ignorance and consequently became covered by illusory energy.</p>
<p>Because they are atomic individual souls (sanatana) eternally, they are prone to be covered by the illusory energy, and thus they become separated from the association of the Supreme Lord, just as the sparks of the fire, although one in quality with the fire, are prone to be extinguished when out of the fire.</p>
<p>In the Varaha Purana, the living entities are described as separated parts and parcels of the Supreme.</p>
<p>They are eternally so, according to the Bhagavad-gita also.</p>
<p>So, even after being liberated from illusion, the living entity remains a separate identity, as is evident from the teachings of the Lord to Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna became liberated by the knowledge received from Krsna, but he never became one with Krsna.</p>

<p>This individual soul is unbreakable and insoluble, and can be neither burned nor dried.</p>
<p>He is everlasting, all-pervading, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All these qualifications of the atomic soul definitely prove that the individual soul is eternally the atomic particle of the spirit whole, and he remains the same atom eternally, without change.</p>
<p>The theory of monism is very difficult to apply in this case, because the individual soul is never expected to become one homogeneously.</p>
<p>After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The word sarva-gatah (all-pervading) is significant because there is no doubt that living entities are all over God's creation.</p>
<p>They live on the land, in the water, in the air, within the earth and even within fire.</p>
<p>The belief that they are sterilized in fire is not acceptable, because it is clearly stated here that the soul cannot be burned by fire.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no doubt that there are living entities also in the sun planet with suitable bodies to live there.</p>
<p>If the sun is uninhabited, then the word sarva-gatah--living everywhere--becomes meaningless.</p>

<p>It is said that the soul is invisible, inconceivable, immutable, and unchangeable.</p>
<p>Knowing this, you should not grieve for the body.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible.</p>
<p>As far as the soul's existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof of sruti or Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception.</p>
<p>There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority.</p>
<p>No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother.</p>
<p>There is no other source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no other source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas.</p>
<p>In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge.</p>
<p>The soul is consciousness and conscious--that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that.</p>
<p>Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul.</p>
<p>As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal.</p>
<p>Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul.</p>
<p>Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly without error.</p>

<p>If, however, you think that the soul is perpetually born and always dies, still you have no reason to lament, O mighty-armed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is always a class of philosophers, almost akin to the Buddhists, who do not believe in the separate existence of the soul beyond the body.</p>
<p>When Lord Krsna spoke the Bhagavad-gita, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the Lokayatikas and Vaibhasikas.</p>
<p>These philosophers maintained that life symptoms, or soul, takes place at a certain mature condition of material combination.</p>
<p>The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly.</p>
<p>According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements.</p>
<p>The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy.</p>
<p>Currently, many pseudo-religions--now becoming fashionable in America--are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects.</p>
<p>Even if Arjuna did not believe in the existence of the soul--as in the Vaibhasika philosophy--there would still have been no cause for lamentation.</p>
<p>No one laments the loss of a certain bulk of chemicals and stops discharging his prescribed duty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in modern science and scientific warfare, so many tons of chemicals are wasted for achieving victory over the enemy.</p>
<p>According to the Vaibhasika philosophy, the so-called soul or atma vanishes along with the deterioration of the body.</p>
<p>So, in any case, whether Arjuna accepted the Vedic conclusion that there is an atomic soul, or whether he did not believe in the existence of the soul, he had no reason to lament.</p>
<p>According to this theory, since there are so many living entities generating out of matter every moment, and so many of them are being vanquished every moment, there is no need to grieve for such an incidence.</p>
<p>However, since he was not risking rebirth of the soul, Arjuna had no reason to be afraid of being affected with sinful reactions due to his killing his grandfather and teacher.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Krsna sarcastically addressed Arjuna as maha-bahu, mighty-armed, because He, at least, did not accept the theory of the Vaibhasikas, which leaves aside the Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>As a ksatriya, Arjuna belonged to the Vedic culture, and it behooved him to continue to follow its principles.</p>

<p>In this way the cycle of birth and death is revolving, one after the other without liberation.</p>
<p>This cycle of birth and death does not, however, support unnecessary murder, slaughter and war.</p>
<p>But at the same time, violence and war are inevitable factors in human society for keeping law and order.</p>
<p>The Battle of Kuruksetra, being the will of the Supreme, was an inevitable event, and to fight for the right cause is the duty of a ksatriya.</p>

<p>All created beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in their interim state, and unmanifest again when they are annihilated.</p>
<p>So what need is there for lamentation?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Accepting that there are two classes of philosophers, one believing in the existence of soul and the other not believing in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation in either case.</p>
<p>Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>Yet even if, for argument's sake, we accept the atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation.</p>
<p>Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation.</p>
<p>From this subtle state of unmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested.</p>
<p>From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth.</p>
<p>When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage.</p>
<p>The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested--that is the difference.</p>
<p>Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost.</p>
<p>Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference.</p>
<p>And if we accept the Vedic conclusion as stated in the Bhagavad-gita (antavanta ime dehah) that these material bodies are perishable in due course of time (nityasyoktah saririnah) but that soul is eternal, then we must remember always that the body is like a dress; therefore why lament the changing of a dress? The material body has no factual existence in relation to the eternal soul.</p>
<p>It is something like a dream.</p>
<p>In a dream we may think of flying in the sky, or sitting on a chariot as a king, but when we wake up we can see that we are neither in the sky nor seated on the chariot.</p>
<p>The Vedic wisdom encourages self-realization on the basis of the nonexistence of the material body.</p>
<p>Therefore, in either case, whether one believes in the existence of the soul, or one does not believe in the existence of the soul, there is no cause for lamentation for loss of the body.</p>

<p>sravanayapi bahubhir yo na labhyah srnvanto 'pi bahavo yah na vidyuh ascaryo vakta kusalo 'sya labdha ascaryo jnata kusalanusistah.</p>
<p>The fact that the atomic soul is within the body of a gigantic animal, in the body of a gigantic banyan tree, and also in the microbic germs, millions and billions of which occupy only an inch of space, is certainly very amazing.</p>
<p>Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahma, the first living being in the universe.</p>
<p>Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small.</p>
<p>So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description.</p>
<p>Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.</p>
<p>Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions, relationships and all other major and minor details.</p>
<p>And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects.</p>
<p>But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one's life is successful.</p>
<p>The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gita spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Krsna, without being deviated by other theories.</p>
<p>But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Krsna can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.</p>

<p>On the authority of Sri Krsna, one has to believe that there is a soul different from the material body, not that there is no such thing as soul, or that living symptoms develop at a certain stage of material maturity resulting from the interaction of chemicals.</p>
<p>Though the soul is immortal, violence is not encouraged, but at the time of war it is not discouraged when there is actual need for it.</p>
<p>That need must be justified in terms of the sanction of the Lord, and not capriciously.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Considering your specific duty as a ksatriya, you should know that there is no better engagement for you than fighting on religious principles; and so there is no need for hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Out of the four orders of social administration, the second order, for the matter of good administration, is called ksatriya.</p>
<p>Ksat means hurt.</p>
<p>One who gives protection from harm is called ksatriya (trayate--to give protection).</p>
<p>The ksatriyas are trained for killing in the forest.</p>
<p>A ksatriya would go into the forest and challenge a tiger face to face and fight with the tiger with his sword.</p>
<p>When the tiger was killed, it would be offered the royal order of cremation.</p>
<p>This system is being followed even up to the present day by the ksatriya kings of Jaipur state.</p>
<p>The ksatriyas are specially trained for challenging and killing because religious violence is sometimes a necessary factor.</p>
<p>Therefore, ksatriyas are never meant for accepting directly the order of sannyasa or renunciation.</p>
<p>Nonviolence in politics may be a diplomacy, but it is never a factor or principle.</p>
<p>In the religious law books it is stated:</p>
<p>ahavesu mitho 'nyonyam jighamsanto mahiksitah yuddhamanah param saktya svargam yanty aparanmukhah yajnesu pasavo brahman hanyante satatam dvijaih samskrtah kila mantrais ca te 'pi svargam avapnuvan.</p>
<p>"In the battlefield, a king or ksatriya, while fighting another king envious of him, is eligible for achieving heavenly planets after death, as the brahmanas also attain the heavenly planets by sacrificing animals in the sacrificial fire."</p>
<p>Therefore, killing on the battle on the religious principle and the killing of animals in the sacrificial fire are not at all considered to be acts of violence, because everyone is benefitted by the religious principles involved.</p>
<p>The animal sacrificed gets a human life immediately without undergoing the gradual evolutionary process from one form to another, and the ksatriyas killed in the battlefield also attain the heavenly planets as do the brahmanas who attain them by offering sacrifice.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of svadharmas, specific duties.</p>
<p>As long as one is not liberated, one has to perform the duties of that particular body in accordance with religious principles in order to achieve liberation.</p>
<p>When one is liberated, one's svadharma--specific duty--becomes spiritual and is not in the material bodily concept.</p>
<p>In the bodily conception of life there are specific duties for the brahmanas and ksatriyas respectively, and such duties are unavoidable.</p>
<p>Svadharma is ordained by the Lord, and this will be clarified in the Fourth Chapter.</p>
<p>On the bodily plane svadharma is called varnasrama-dharma, or man's steppingstone for spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Human civilization begins from the stage of varnasrama-dharma, or specific duties in terms of the specific modes of nature of the body obtained.</p>
<p>Discharging one's specific duty in any field of action in accordance with varnasrama-dharma serves to elevate one to a higher status of life.</p>

<p>As supreme teacher of the world, Lord Krsna condemns the attitude of Arjuna who said, "I do not find any good in this fighting.</p>
<p>It will cause perpetual habitation in hell."</p>
<p>Such statements by Arjuna were due to ignorance only.</p>
<p>He wanted to become nonviolent in the discharge of his specific duty.</p>
<p>For a ksatriya to be in the battlefield and to become nonviolent is the philosophy of fools.</p>
<p>In the Parasara-smrti or religious codes made by Parasara, the great sage and father of Vyasadeva, it is stated:</p>
<p>ksatriyo hi praja raksan sastra-panih pradandayan nirjitya parasainyadi ksitim dharmena palayet.</p>
<p>"The ksatriya's duty is to protect the citizens from all kinds of difficulties, and for that reason he has to apply violence in suitable cases for law and order.</p>
<p>Therefore he has to conquer the soldiers of inimical kings, and thus, with religious principles, he should rule over the world."</p>
<p>Considering all aspects, Arjuna had no reason to refrain from fighting.</p>
<p>If he should conquer his enemies, he would enjoy the kingdom; and if he should die in the battle, he would be elevated to the heavenly planets whose doors were wide open to him.</p>
<p>Fighting would be for his benefit in either case.</p>

<p>Everyone knew that he was a great warrior.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Krsna now directly says that Arjuna should fight for the sake of fighting because He desires the battle.</p>
<p>There is no consideration of happiness or distress, profit or gain, victory or defeat in the activities of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That everything should be performed for the sake of Krsna is transcendental consciousness; so there is no reaction to material activities.</p>
<p>He who acts for his own sense gratification, either in goodness or in passion, is subject to the reaction, good or bad.</p>
<p>But he who has completely surrendered himself in the activities of Krsna consciousness is no longer obliged to anyone, nor is he a debtor to anyone, as one is in the ordinary course of activities.</p>
<p>It is said:</p>
<p>devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam na kinkaro nayamrni ca rajan sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam gato mukundam parihrtya kartam (Bhag.11.5.41)</p>
<p>"Anyone who has completely surrendered unto Krsna, Mukunda, giving up all other duties, is no longer a debtor, nor is he obliged to anyone--not the demigods, nor the sages, nor the people in general, nor kinsmen, nor humanity, nor forefathers."</p>
<p>That is the indirect hint given by Krsna to Arjuna in this verse, and the matter will be more clearly explained in the following verses.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#239" id="239">2.39</a></h3>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus far I have declared to you the analytical knowledge of sankhya philosophy.</p>
<p>Now listen to the knowledge of yoga whereby one works without fruitive result.</p>
<p>O son of Prtha, when you act by such intelligence, you can free yourself from the bondage of works.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary, sankhya means that which describes phenomena in detail, and sankhya refers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul.</p>
<p>And yoga involves controlling the senses.</p>
<p>Arjuna's proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification.</p>
<p>Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom by conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons of Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, for there is a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.</p>
<p>Krsna, therefore, wanted to explain to Arjuna that by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally, and we simply change our bodily dress in different manners.</p>
<p>But, actually, we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress.</p>
<p>An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here as sankhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary.</p>
<p>This sankhya has nothing to do with the sankhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila.</p>
<p>Long before the imposter Kapila's sankhya, the sankhya philosophy was expounded in the Srimad-Bhagavatam by the true Lord Kapila, the incarnation of Lord Krsna, who explained it to His mother, Devahuti.</p>
<p>It is clearly explained by Him that the Purusa, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over the prakrti.</p>
<p>This is accepted in the Vedas and in the Gita.</p>
<p>The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over the prakrti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individuals souls.</p>
<p>All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers.</p>
<p>This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the last snare of maya or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders unto Vasudeva, Lord Krsna, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>Arjuna has already accepted Krsna as his spiritual master by surrendering himself unto Him: sisyas te 'ham sadhi mam tvam prapannam.</p>
<p>Consequently, Krsna will now tell him about the working process in buddhi-yoga, or karma-yoga, or in other words, the practice of devotional service only for the sense gratification of the Lord.</p>
<p>This buddhi-yoga is clearly explained in Chapter Ten, verse ten, as being direct communion with the Lord, who is sitting as Paramatma in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>But such communion does not take place without devotional service.</p>
<p>One who is therefore situated in devotional or transcendental loving service to the Lord, or, in other words, in Krsna consciousness, attains to this stage of buddhi-yoga by the special grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord says, therefore, that only to those who are always engaged in devotional service out of transcendental love does He award the pure knowledge of devotion in love.</p>
<p>In that way the devotee can reach Him easily in the ever-blissful kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Thus the buddhi-yoga mentioned in this verse is the devotional service of the Lord, and the word sankhya mentioned herein has nothing to do with the atheistic sankhya-yoga enunciated by the impostor Kapila.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, misunderstand that the sankhya-yoga mentioned herein has any connection with the atheistic sankhya.</p>
<p>Nor did that philosophy have any influence during that time; nor would Lord Krsna care to mention such godless philosophical speculations.</p>
<p>Real sankhya philosophy is described by Lord Kapila in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, but even that sankhya has nothing to do with the current topics.</p>
<p>Here, sankhya means analytical description of the body and the soul.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna made an analytical description of the soul just to bring Arjuna to the point of buddhi-yoga, or bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Therefore, Lord Krsna's sankhya and Lord Kapila's sankhya, as described in the Bhagavatam; are one and the same.</p>
<p>They are all bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>He said, therefore, that only the less intelligent class of men make a distinction between sankhya-yoga and bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Of course, atheistic sankhya-yoga has nothing to do with bhakti-yoga, yet the unintelligent claim that the atheistic sankhya-yoga is referred to in the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One should therefore understand that buddhi-yoga means to work in Krsna consciousness, in the full bliss and knowledge of devotional service.</p>
<p>One who works for the satisfaction of the Lord only, however difficult such work may be, is working under the principles of buddhi-yoga and finds himself always in transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>By such transcendental engagement, one achieves all transcendental qualities automatically, by the grace of the Lord, and thus his liberation is complete in itself, without his making extraneous endeavors to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>There is much difference between work in Krsna consciousness and work for fruitive results, especially in the matter of sense gratification for achieving results in terms of family or material happiness.</p>
<p>Buddhi-yoga is therefore the transcendental quality of the work that we perform.</p>

<p>In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Activity in Krsna consciousness, or acting for the benefit of Krsna without expectation of sense gratification, is the highest transcendental quality of work.</p>
<p>Even a small beginning of such activity finds no impediment, nor can that small beginning be lost at any stage.</p>
<p>Any work begun on the material plane has to be completed, otherwise the whole attempt becomes a failure.</p>
<p>But any work begun in Krsna consciousness has a permanent effect, even though not finished.</p>
<p>The performer of such work is therefore not at a loss even if his work in Krsna consciousness is incomplete.</p>
<p>One percent done in Krsna consciousness bears permanent results, so that the next beginning is from the point of two percent; whereas, in material activity, without a hundred percent success, there is no profit.</p>
<p>Ajamila performed his duty in some percentage of Krsna consciousness, but the result he enjoyed at the end was a hundred percent, by the grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is a nice verse in this connection in Srimad-Bhagavatam:</p>
<p>tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer bhajan na pakko 'tha patet tato yadi yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim ko vartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah</p>
<p>"If someone gives up self-gratificatory pursuits and works in Krsna consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? And, what can one gain if one performs his material activities perfectly?" (Bhag.1.5.17) Or, as the Christians say, "What profiteth a man if he gain the whole world yet suffers the loss of his eternal soul?"</p>
<p>Material activities and their results end with the body.</p>
<p>But work in Krsna consciousness carries the person again to Krsna consciousness, even after the loss of the body.</p>
<p>At least one is sure to have a chance in the next life of being born again as a human being, either in the family of a great cultured brahmana or in a rich aristocratic family that will give one a further chance for elevation.</p>
<p>That is the unique quality of work done in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>Those who are on this path are resolute in purpose, and their aim is one.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A strong faith in Krsna consciousness that one should be elevated to the highest perfection of life is called vyavasayatmika intelligence.</p>
<p>The Caitanya-caritamrta [Cc.Madhya 22.62] states:</p>
<p>'sraddha'-sabde visvasa kahe sudrdha niscaya krsne bhakti kaile sarva-karma krta haya</p>
<p>Faith means unflinching trust in something sublime.</p>
<p>When one is engaged in the duties of Krsna consciousness, he need not act in relationship to the material world with obligations to family traditions, humanity, or nationality.</p>
<p>Fruitive activities are the engagements of one's reactions from past good or bad deeds.</p>
<p>When one is awake in Krsna consciousness, he need no longer endeavor for good results in his activities.</p>
<p>When one is situated in Krsna consciousness, all activities are on the absolute plane, for they are no longer subject to dualities like good and bad.</p>
<p>The highest perfection of Krsna consciousness is renunciation of the material conception of life.</p>
<p>This state is automatically achieved by progressive Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The resolute purpose of a person in Krsna consciousness is based on knowledge ("Vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah") by which one comes to know perfectly that Vasudeva, or Krsna, is the root of all manifested causes.</p>
<p>As water on the root of a tree is automatically distributed to the leaves and branches, in Krsna consciousness, one can render the highest service to everyone--namely self, family, society, country, humanity, etc.</p>
<p>If Krsna is satisfied by one's actions, then everyone will be satisfied.</p>
<p>Service in Krsna consciousness is, however, best practiced under the able guidance of a spiritual master who is a bona fide representative of Krsna, who knows the nature of the student and who can guide him to act in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As such, to be well-versed in Krsna consciousness one has to act firmly and obey the representative of Krsna, and one should accept the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master as one's mission in life.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakur instructs us, in his famous prayers for the spiritual master, as follows:</p>
<p>yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado yasyaprasadanna gatih kuto 'pi dhyayam stuvams tasya yasas tri-sandhyam vande guroh sri-caranaravindam.</p>
<p>"By satisfaction of the spiritual master, the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes satisfied.</p>
<p>And by not satisfying the spiritual master, there is no chance of being promoted to the plane of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>I should, therefore, meditate and pray for his mercy three times a day, and offer my respectful obeisances unto him, my spiritual master."</p>
<p>The whole process, however, depends on perfect knowledge of the soul beyond the conception of the body--not theoretically but practically, when there is no longer chance for sense gratification manifested in fruitive activities.</p>
<p>One who is not firmly fixed in mind is diverted by various types of fruitive acts.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Men of small knowledge are very much attached to the flowery words of the Vedas, which recommend various fruitive activities for elevation to heavenly planets, resultant good birth, power, and so forth.</p>
<p>Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the karma-kanda portions of the Vedas.</p>
<p>They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common.</p>
<p>In the Vedas many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the jyotistoma sacrifices.</p>
<p>In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.</p>
<p>In the karma-kanda section of the Vedas it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the somarasa beverages to become immortal and happy forever.</p>
<p>Even on this earth some are very eager to have somarasa to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratifications.</p>
<p>Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices.</p>
<p>They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life.</p>
<p>It is understood that there are gardens called nandana-kanana in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of somarasa wine.</p>
<p>Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.</p>

<p>The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Rise above these modes, O Arjuna.</p>
<p>Be transcendental to all of them.</p>
<p>Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>They are meant for fruitive results, which cause bondage in the material world.</p>
<p>The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane.</p>
<p>Arjuna, as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the Supreme Transcendence.</p>
<p>All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence.</p>
<p>For them the Lord, after creation of the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement.</p>
<p>When the activities for sense gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata.</p>
<p>The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life.</p>
<p>As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in the material modes.</p>
<p>One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss.</p>
<p>This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependant on the good will of Krsna</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All purposes that are served by the small pond can at once be served by the great reservoirs of water.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the purposes of the Vedas can be served to one who knows the purpose behind them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The rituals and sacrifices mentioned in the karma-kanda division of the Vedic literature are to encourage gradual development of self-realization.</p>
<p>And the purpose of self-realization is clearly stated in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita (15.15): the purpose of studying the Vedas is to know Lord Krsna, the primeval cause of everything.</p>
<p>So, self-realization means understanding Krsna and one's eternal relationship with Him.</p>
<p>The relationship of the living entities with Krsna is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The living entities are parts and parcels of Krsna; therefore, revival of Krsna consciousness by the individual living entity is the highest perfectional stage of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.33.7) as follows:</p>
<p>aho bata svapaco'to gariyan yaj-jihvagre vartate nama tubhyam tepus tapas te juhuvuh sasnur arya brahmanucur nama grnanti ye te.</p>
<p>"O my Lord, a person who is chanting Your holy name, although born of a low family like that of a candala [dog eater], is situated on the highest platform of self-realization.</p>
<p>Such a person must have performed all kinds of penances and sacrifices according to Vedic rituals and studied the Vedic literatures many, many times after taking his bath in all the holy places of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Such a person is considered to be the best of the Aryan family."</p>
<p>So one must be intelligent enough to understand the purpose of the Vedas, without being attached to the rituals only, and must not desire to be elevated to the heavenly kingdoms for a better quality of sense gratification.</p>
<p>It is not possible for the common man in this age to follow all the rules and regulations of the Vedic rituals and the injunctions of the Vedantas and the Upanisads.</p>
<p>It requires much time, energy, knowledge and resources to execute the purposes of the Vedas.</p>
<p>This is hardly possible in this age.</p>
<p>The best purpose of Vedic culture is served, however, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, as recommended by Lord Caitanya, the deliverer of all fallen souls.</p>
<p>When Lord Caitanya was asked by a great Vedic scholar, Prakasananda Sarasvati, why He, the Lord, was chanting the holy name of the Lord like a sentimentalist instead of studying Vedanta philosophy, the Lord replied that His spiritual master found Him to be a great fool, and thus he asked Him to chant the holy name of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>He did so, and became ecstatic like a madman.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, most of the population is foolish and not adequately educated to understand Vedanta philosophy; the best purpose of Vedanta philosophy is served by inoffensively chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Vedanta is the last word in Vedic wisdom, and the author and knower of the Vedanta philosophy is Lord Krsna; and the highest Vedantist is the great soul who takes pleasure in chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate purpose of all Vedic mysticism.</p>

<p>karmani--prescribed duties; eva--certainly; adhikarah--right; te--of you; ma--never; phalesu--in the fruits; kadacana--at any time; ma--never; karma-phala--in the result of the work; hetuh--cause; bhuh--become; ma--never; te--of you; sangah--attachment; astu--be there; akarmani--in not doing.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action.</p>
<p>Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are three considerations here: prescribed duties, capricious work, and inaction.</p>
<p>Prescribed duties refer to activities performed while one is in the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Capricious work means actions without the sanction of authority, and inaction means not performing one's prescribed duties.</p>
<p>The Lord advised that Arjuna not be inactive, but that he perform his prescribed duty without being attached to the result.</p>
<p>One who is attached to the result of his work is also the cause of the action.</p>
<p>Thus he is the enjoyer or sufferer of the result of such actions.</p>
<p>As far as prescribed duties are concerned, they can be fitted into three subdivisions, namely routine work, emergency work and desired activities.</p>
<p>Routine work, in terms of the scriptural injunctions, is done without desire for results.</p>
<p>As one has to do it, obligatory work is action in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Work with results becomes the cause of bondage; therefore such work is not auspicious.</p>
<p>Everyone has his proprietory right in regard to prescribed duties, but should act without attachment to the result; such disinterested obligatory duties doubtlessly lead one to the path of liberation.</p>
<p>Arjuna was therefore advised by the Lord to fight as a matter of duty without attachment to the result.</p>
<p>His nonparticipation in the battle is another side of attachment.</p>
<p>Such attachment never leads one to the path of salvation.</p>
<p>Any attachment, positive or negative, is cause for bondage.</p>
<p>Inaction is sinful.</p>
<p>Therefore, fighting as a matter of duty was the only auspicious path of salvation for Arjuna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Be steadfast in yoga, O Arjuna.</p>
<p>Perform your duty and abandon all attachment to success or failure.</p>
<p>Such evenness of mind is called yoga.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna tells Arjuna that he should act in yoga.</p>
<p>And what is that yoga? Yoga means to concentrate the mind upon the Supreme by controlling the ever-disturbing senses.</p>
<p>And who is the Supreme? The Supreme is the Lord.</p>
<p>And because He Himself is telling Arjuna to fight, Arjuna has nothing to do with the results of the fight.</p>
<p>Gain or victory are Krsna's concern; Arjuna is simply advised to act according to the dictation of Krsna.</p>
<p>The following of Krsna's dictation is real yoga, and this is practiced in the process called Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>By Krsna consciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship.</p>
<p>One has to become the servant of Krsna, or the servant of the servant of Krsna.</p>
<p>That is the right way to discharge duty in Krsna consciousness, which alone can help one to act in yoga.</p>
<p>Arjuna is a ksatriya, and as such he is participating in the varnasrama-dharma institution.</p>
<p>It is said in the Visnu Purana that in the varnasrama-dharma, the whole aim is to satisfy Visnu.</p>
<p>No one should satisfy himself, as is the rule in the material world, but one should satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>So, unless one satisfies Krsna, one cannot correctly observe the principles of varnasrama-dharma.</p>
<p>Indirectly, Arjuna was advised to act as Krsna told him.</p>

<p>One who has actually come to understand one's constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord gives up all engagements save working in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As already explained, buddhi-yoga means transcendental loving service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Such devotional service is the right course of action for the living entity.</p>
<p>Only misers desire to enjoy the fruit of their own work just to be further entangled in material bondage.</p>
<p>Except for work in Krsna consciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work.</p>
<p>Everything should be done in Krsna consciousness for the satisfaction of Krsna.</p>
<p>Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor.</p>

<p>The wise, engaged in devotional service, take refuge in the Lord, and free themselves from the cycle of birth and death by renouncing the fruits of action in the material world.</p>
<p>In this way they can attain that state beyond all miseries.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The liberated living entities seek that place where there are no material miseries.</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam says:</p>
<p>samasrita ye padapallava-plavam mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh bhavambudhir vatsa-padam param padam param padam yad vipadam na tesam (Bhag.10.14.58)</p>
<p>"For one who has accepted the boat of the lotus feet of the Lord, who is the shelter of the cosmic manifestation and is famous as Mukunda or the giver of mukti, the ocean of the material world is like the water contained in a calf's hoofprint.</p>
<p>Param padam, or the place where there are no material miseries, or Vaikuntha, is his goal, not the place where there is danger in every step of life."</p>
<p>Owing to ignorance, one does not know that this material world is a miserable place where there are dangers at every step.</p>
<p>Out of ignorance only, less intelligent persons try to adjust to the situation by fruitive activities, thinking that resultant actions will make them happy.</p>
<p>They do not know that no kind of material body anywhere within the universe can give life without miseries.</p>
<p>The miseries of life, namely birth, death, old age and diseases, are present everywhere within the material world.</p>
<p>But one who understands his real constitutional position as the eternal servitor of the Lord, and thus knows the position of the Personality of Godhead, engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Consequently he becomes qualified to enter into the Vaikuntha planets, where there is neither material, miserable life, nor the influence of time and death.</p>
<p>To know one's constitutional position means to know also the sublime position of the Lord.</p>
<p>One who wrongly thinks that the living entity's position and the Lord's position are on the same level is to be understood to be in darkness and therefore unable to engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He becomes a lord himself and thus paves the way for the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>But one who, understanding that his position is to serve, transfers himself to the service of the Lord, at once becomes eligible for Vaikunthaloka.</p>
<p>Service for the cause of the Lord is called karma-yoga or buddhi-yoga, or in plain words, devotional service to the Lord.</p>

<p>When your intelligence has passed out of the dense forest of delusion, you shall become indifferent to all that has been heard and all that is to be heard.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many good examples in the lives of the great devotees of the Lord of those who became indifferent to the rituals of the Vedas simply by devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>When a person factually understands Krsna and his relationship with Krsna, he naturally becomes completely indifferent to the rituals of fruitive activities, even though an experienced brahmana.</p>
<p>Sri Madhavendra Puri, a great devotee and acarya in the line of the devotees, says:</p>
<p>sandhya-vandana bhadram astu bhavato bhoh snana tubhyam namo bho devah pitaras ca tarpana-vidhau naham ksamah ksamyatam yatra kvapi nisadya yadava-kulottamasya kamsa-dvisah smaram smaram agham harami tad alam manye kim anyena me.</p>

<p>Bathing, I offer my obeisances unto You.</p>
<p>O demigods! O forefathers! Please excuse me for my inability to offer you my respects.</p>
<p>Now wherever I sit, I can remember the great descendant of the Yadu dynasty [Krsna], the enemy of Kamsa, and thereby I can free myself from all sinful bondage.</p>
<p>I think this is sufficient for me."</p>
<p>The Vedic rites and rituals are imperative for neophytes: comprehending all kinds of prayer three times a day, taking a bath early in the morning, offering respects to the forefathers, etc.</p>
<p>But, when one is fully in Krsna consciousness and is engaged in His transcendental loving service, one becomes indifferent to all these regulative principles because he has already attained perfection.</p>
<p>If one can reach the platform of understanding by service to the Supreme Lord Krsna, he has no longer to execute different types of penances and sacrifices as recommended in revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>And, similarly, if one has not understood that the purpose of the Vedas is to reach Krsna and simply engages in the rituals, etc., then he is uselessly wasting time in such engagements.</p>
<p>Persons in Krsna consciousness transcend the limit of sabda-brahma, or the range of the Vedas and Upanisads.</p>

<p>The Bhagavatam affirms that any person who is fully in Krsna consciousness, or devotional service of the Lord, has all the good qualities of the great sages, whereas a person who is not so transcendentally situated has no good qualifications, because he is sure to be taking refuge in his own mental concoctions.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction.</p>
<p>Artificially, such sense desires cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>But if one is engaged in Krsna consciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to engage himself in Krsna consciousness without hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one on to the platform of transcendental consciousness.</p>
<p>The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>The word muni means one who can agitate his mind in various ways for mental speculation without coming to a factual conclusion.</p>
<p>It is said that every muni has a different angle of vision, and unless a muni differs from other munis, he cannot be called a muni in the strict sense of the term.</p>
<p>Nasau munir yasya matam na binnam.</p>
<p>But a sthita-dhi-muni as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinary muni The sthita-dhi-muni is always in Krsna consciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation.</p>
<p>He has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that Lord Sri Krsna, or Vasudeva, is everything.</p>
<p>He is called a muni fixed in mind.</p>
<p>Such a fully Krsna conscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest.</p>
<p>Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord's grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord.</p>
<p>And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion.</p>
<p>Attachment means accepting things for one's own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment.</p>
<p>But one fixed in Krsna consciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is always steady in his determination.</p>

<p>The test of a yogi, devotee, or self-realized soul is that he is able to control the senses according to his plan.</p>
<p>Most people, however, are servants of the senses and are thus directed by the dictation of the senses.</p>
<p>That is the answer to the question as to how the yogi is situated.</p>
<p>The senses are compared to venomous serpents.</p>
<p>They want to act very loosely and without restriction.</p>
<p>The yogi, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents--like a snake charmer.</p>
<p>He never allows them to act independantly.</p>
<p>There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not's, and some of them are do's.</p>
<p>Unless one is able to follow the do's and the do-not's, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The best example, set herein, is the tortoise.</p>
<p>The tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes.</p>
<p>Similarly, the senses of the Krsna conscious persons are used only for some particular purpose in the service of the Lord and are withdrawn otherwise.</p>
<p>Keeping the senses always in the service of the Lord is the example set by the analogy of the tortoise, who keeps the senses within.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables.</p>
<p>The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions, nor loses his taste for eatables.</p>
<p>Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like astanga-yoga, in the matter of yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge.</p>
<p>But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Krsna, in the course of his advancement in Krsna consciousness, no longer has a taste for dead material things.</p>
<p>Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>When one is actually Krsna conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many learned sages, philosophers and transcendentalists who try to conquer the senses, but in spite of their endeavors, even the greatest of them sometimes fall victim to material sense enjoyment due to the agitated mind.</p>
<p>Even Visvamitra, a great sage and perfect yogi, was misled by Menaka into sex enjoyment, although the yogi was endeavoring for sense control with severe types of penance and yoga practice.</p>
<p>And,of course, there are so many similar instances in the history of the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is very difficult to control the mind and the senses without being fully Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Without engaging the mind in Krsna, one cannot cease such material engagements.</p>
<p>A practical example is given by Sri Yamunacarya, a great saint and devotee, who says: "Since my mind has been engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, and I have been enjoying an ever new transcendental humor, whenever I think of sex life with a woman, my face at once turns from it, and I spit at the thought."</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is such a transcendentally nice thing that automatically material enjoyment becomes distasteful.</p>
<p>It is as if a hungry man had satisfied his hunger by a sufficient quantity of nutritious eatables.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa also conquered a great yogi, Durvasa Muni, simply because his mind was engaged in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>One who restrains his senses and fixes his consciousness upon Me is known as a man of steady intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>That the highest conception of yoga perfection is Krsna consciousness is clearly explained in this verse.</p>
<p>And, unless one is Krsna conscious, it is not at all possible to control the senses.</p>
<p>As cited above, the great sage Durvasa Muni picked a quarrel with Maharaja Ambarisa, and Durvasa Muni unnecessarily became angry out of pride and therefore could not check his senses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the King, although not as powerful a yogi as the sage, but a devotee of the Lord, silently tolerated all the sage's injustices and thereby emerged victorious.</p>
<p>The King was able to control his senses because of the following qualifications, as mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam:</p>
<p>sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanavarnane karau harer mandira-marjanadisu srutim cakaracyuta-sat-kathodaye</p>
<p>mukunda-lingalaya-darsane drsau tad-bhrtya-gatra-sparse'nga-sangamam ghranam ca tat-pada-saroja-saurabhe srimat-tulasya rasanam tad-arpite</p>
<p>padau hareh ksetra-padanusarpane siro hrsikesa-padabhivandane kamam ca dasye na tu kama-kamyaya yathottamasloka-janasraya ratih</p>
<p>"King Ambarisa fixed his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, engaged his words in describing the abode of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing the pastimes of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the form of the Lord, his body in touching the body of the devotee, his nostrils in smelling the flavor of the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasi leaves offered to Him, his legs in traveling to the holy place where His temple is situated, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord, and his desires in fulfilling the desires of the Lord ... and all these qualifications made him fit to become a mat-parah devotee of the Lord." (Bhag.9.4.18-20)</p>
<p>The word mat-parah is most significant in this connection.</p>
<p>How one can become a mat-parah is described in the life of Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>Srila Baladeva Vidyabhusana, a great scholar and acarya in the line of the mat-parah, remarks: "mad-bhakti-prabhavena sarvendriya-vijaya-purvika svatma drstih sulabheti bhavah."</p>
<p>"The senses can be completely controlled only by the strength of devotional service to Krsna."</p>
<p>Also the example of fire is sometimes given: "As the small flames within burn everything within the room, similarly Lord Visnu, situated in the heart of the yogi, burns up all kinds of impurities."</p>
<p>The Yoga-sutra also prescribes meditation on Visnu, and not meditation on the void.</p>
<p>The so-called yogis who meditate on something which is not the Visnu form simply waste their time in a vain search after some phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>We have to be Krsna conscious--devoted to the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the aim of the real yoga.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is not Krsna conscious is subjected to material desires while contemplating the objects of senses.</p>
<p>The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism.</p>
<p>In the material world everyone, including Lord Siva and Lord Brahma--to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets--is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Lord Siva was deep in meditation, but when Parvati agitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result Kartikeya was born.</p>
<p>When Haridasa Thakur was a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation of Maya Devi, but Haridasa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse of Sri Yamunacarya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord.</p>
<p>That is the secret of success.</p>
<p>One who is not, therefore, in Krsna consciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires.</p>

<p>From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By development of Krsna consciousness one can know that everything has its use in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who are without knowledge of Krsna consciousness artificially try to avoid material objects, and as a result, although they desire liberation from material bondage, they do not attain to the perfect stage of renunciation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a person in Krsna consciousness knows how to use everything in the service of the Lord; therefore he does not become a victim of material consciousness.</p>
<p>For example, for an impersonalist, the Lord, or the Absolute, being impersonal, cannot eat.</p>
<p>Whereas an impersonalist tries to avoid good eatables, a devotee knows that Krsna is the supreme enjoyer and that He eats all that is offered to Him in devotion.</p>
<p>So, after offering good eatables to the Lord, the devotee takes the remnants, called prasadam.</p>
<p>Thus everything becomes spiritualized and there is no danger of a downfall.</p>
<p>The devotee takes prasadam in Krsna consciousness, whereas the nondevotee rejects it as material.</p>
<p>The impersonalist, therefore, cannot enjoy life due to his artificial renunciation; and for this reason, a slight agitation of the mind pulls him down again into the pool of material existence.</p>
<p>It is said that such a soul, even though rising up to the point of liberation, falls down again due to his not having support in devotional service.</p>

<p>One who can control his senses by practicing the regulated principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord and thus become free from all attachment and aversion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is already explained that one may externally control the senses by some artificial process, but unless the senses are engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is every chance of a fall.</p>
<p>Although the person in full Krsna consciousness may apparently be on the sensual plane, because of his being Krsna conscious, he has no attachment to sensual activities.</p>
<p>The Krsna conscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction of Krsna, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment.</p>
<p>If Krsna wants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and if Krsna does not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction.</p>
<p>Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction of Krsna.</p>
<p>This consciousness is the causeless mercy of the Lord, which the devotee can achieve in spite of his being attached to the sensual platform.</p>

<p>One who is not in transcendental consciousness can have neither a controlled mind nor steady intelligence, without which there is no possibility of peace.</p>
<p>And how can there be any happiness without peace?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is in Krsna consciousness, there is no possibility of peace.</p>
<p>So it is confirmed in the Fifth Chapter (5.29) that when one understands that Krsna is the only enjoyer of all the good results of sacrifice and penance, and that He is the proprietor of all universal manifestations, that He is the real friend of all living entities, then only can one have real peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one is not in Krsna consciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind.</p>
<p>Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain that Krsna is the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace.</p>
<p>Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship with Krsna is certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much one may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship with Krsna.</p>

<p>As long as one has the material body, the demands of the body for sense gratification will continue.</p>
<p>The devotee, however, is not disturbed by such desires because of his fullness.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious man is not in need of anything because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities.</p>
<p>Therefore he is like the ocean--always full in himself.</p>
<p>Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification.</p>
<p>That is the proof of a Krsna conscious man--one who has lost all inclinations for material sense gratification, although the desires are present.</p>
<p>Because he remains satisfied in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he can remain steady, like the ocean, and therefore enjoy full peace.</p>
<p>Others, however, who fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace.</p>
<p>The fruitive workers, the salvationists, and also the yogis who are after mystic powers, are all unhappy because of unfulfilled desires.</p>
<p>But the person in Krsna consciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage.</p>
<p>The devotees of Krsna have no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego--he alone can attain real peace.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification.</p>
<p>In other words, desire for becoming Krsna conscious is actually desirelessness.</p>
<p>To understand one's actual position as the eternal servitor of Krsna, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that because Krsna is the proprietor of everything, therefore everything must be used for the satisfaction of Krsna.</p>
<p>Arjuna did not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fully Krsna conscious he fought because Krsna wanted him to fight.</p>
<p>For himself there was no desire to fight, but for Krsna the same Arjuna fought to his best ability.</p>
<p>Desire for the satisfaction of Krsna is really desirelessness; it is not an artificial attempt to abolish desires.</p>
<p>The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires.</p>
<p>A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs to Krsna (isavasyam idam sarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything.</p>
<p>This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization--namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is the eternal part and parcel of Krsna in spiritual identity and therefore the eternal position of the living entity is never on the level of Krsna or greater than Him.</p>
<p>This understanding of Krsna consciousness is the basic principle of real peace.</p>

<p>That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered.</p>
<p>Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One can attain Krsna consciousness or divine life at once, within a second--or one may not attain such a state of life even after millions of births.</p>
<p>It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact.</p>
<p>Khatvanga Maharaja attained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering unto Krsna.</p>
<p>Nirvana means ending the process of materialistic life.</p>
<p>According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-gita teaches differently.</p>
<p>Actual life begins after the completion of this material life.</p>
<p>For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life.</p>
<p>Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomes Krsna conscious, he at once attains the stage of Brahma-nirvana.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Attainment of Krsna consciousness even during this life is immediate attainment of Brahman, and one who is situated in Krsna consciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Brahman is just the opposite of matter.</p>
<p>Therefore brahmi sthitih means "not on the platform of material activities."</p>
<p>Devotional service of the Lord is accepted in the Bhagavad-gita as the liberated stage.</p>
<p>Therefore, brahmi-sthitih is liberation from material bondage.</p>

<p>Arjuna said: O Janardana, O Kesava, why do You urge me to engage in this ghastly warfare, if You think that intelligence is better than fruitive work?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna has very elaborately described the constitution of the soul in the previous chapter, with a view to deliver His intimate friend Arjuna from the ocean of material grief.</p>
<p>And the path of realization has been recommended: buddhi-yoga, or Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Sometimes Krsna consciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fully Krsna conscious by chanting the holy name of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>But without being trained in the philosophy of Krsna consciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name of Krsna in a secluded place where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public.</p>
<p>Arjuna also thought of Krsna consciousness or buddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place.</p>
<p>In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by using Krsna consciousness as an excuse.</p>
<p>But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questioned Krsna as to his best course of action.</p>
<p>In answer, Lord Krsna elaborately explained karma-yoga, or work in Krsna consciousness, in this Third Chapter.</p>

<p>My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the previous chapter, as a prelude to the Bhagavad-gita, many different paths were explained, such as sankhya-yoga, buddhi-yoga, control of the senses by intelligence, work without fruitive desire, and the position of the neophyte.</p>
<p>This was all presented unsystematically.</p>
<p>A more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding.</p>
<p>Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Although Krsna had no intention of confusing Arjuna by any jugglery of words, Arjuna could not follow the process of Krsna consciousness--either by inertia or active service.</p>
<p>In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path of Krsna consciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: O sinless Arjuna, I have already explained that there are two classes of men who realize the Self.</p>
<p>Some are inclined to understand Him by empirical, philosophical speculation, and others are inclined to know Him by devotional work.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of procedures--namely sankhya-yoga and karma-yoga, or buddhi-yoga.</p>
<p>In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly.</p>
<p>Sankhya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy.</p>
<p>The other class of men work in Krsna consciousness, as it is explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter.</p>
<p>The Lord has explained, also in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles of buddhi-yoga, or Krsna consciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process.</p>
<p>The same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st verse--that this buddhi-yoga is to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, on Krsna), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily.</p>
<p>Therefore, both the yogas are interdependant, as religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is Krsna, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end to Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself.</p>
<p>The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point of Krsna consciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with everything in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Of these two, the path of Krsna consciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Not by merely abstaining from work can one achieve freedom from reaction, nor by renunciation alone can one attain perfection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The renounced order of life can be accepted upon being purified by the discharge of the prescribed form of duties which are laid down just to purify the heart of materialistic men.</p>
<p>Without purification, one cannot attain success by abruptly adopting the fourth order of life (sannyasa).</p>
<p>According to the empirical philosophers, simply by adopting sannyasa, or retiring from fruitive activities, one at once becomes as good as Narayana.</p>
<p>But Lord Krsna does not approve this principle.</p>
<p>Without purification of heart, sannyasa is simply a disturbance to the social order.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if someone takes to the transcendental service of the Lord, even without discharging his prescribed duties, whatever he may be able to advance in the cause is accepted by the Lord (buddhi-yoga).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All men are forced to act helplessly according to the impulses born of the modes of material nature; therefore no one can refrain from doing something, not even for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is not a question of embodied life, but it is the nature of the soul to be always active.</p>
<p>Without the presence of the spirit soul, the material body cannot move.</p>
<p>The body is only a dead vehicle to be worked by the spirit soul, which is always active and cannot stop even for a moment.</p>
<p>As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work of Krsna consciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy.</p>
<p>In contact with material energy, the spirit soul acquires material modes, and to purify the soul from such affinities it is necessary to engage in the prescribed duties enjoined in the sastras.</p>
<p>But if the soul is engaged in his natural function of Krsna consciousness, whatever he is able to do is good for him.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam affirms this:</p>
<p>tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim ko vartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah.</p>
<p>"If someone takes to Krsna consciousness, even though he may not follow the prescribed duties in the sastras nor execute the devotional service properly, and even though he may fall down from the standard, there is no loss or evil for him.</p>
<p>But if he carries out all the injunctions for purification in the sastras, what does it avail him if he is not Krsna conscious?" (Bhag.1.5.17) So the purificatory process is necessary for reaching this point of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore, sannyasa, or any purificatory process, is to help reach the ultimate goal of becoming Krsna conscious, without which everything is considered a failure.</p>

<p>One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many pretenders who refuse to work in Krsna consciousness but make a show of meditation, while actually dwelling within the mind upon sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Such pretenders may also speak on dry philosophy in order to bluff sophisticated followers, but according to this verse these are the greatest cheaters.</p>
<p>For sense enjoyment one can act in any capacity of the social order, but if one follows the rules and regulations of his particular status, he can make gradual progress in purifying his existence.</p>
<p>But he who makes a show of being a yogi, while actually searching for the objects of sense gratification, must be called the greatest cheater, even though he sometimes speaks of philosophy.</p>
<p>His knowledge has no value because the effects of such a sinful man's knowledge are taken away by the illusory energy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Such a pretender's mind is always impure, and therefore his show of yogic meditation has no value whatsoever.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he who controls the senses by the mind and engages his active organs in works of devotion, without attachment, is by far superior.</p>

<p>Instead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one's own business and execute the purpose of life, which is to get free from material bondage and enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The prime svartha-gati, or goal of self-interest, is to reach Visnu.</p>
<p>The whole institution of varna and asrama is designed to help us reach this goal of life.</p>
<p>A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>For self-realization, one can live a controlled life, as prescribed in the sastras, and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and in that way make progress.</p>
<p>Such a sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public.</p>
<p>A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who meditates only for the sake of making a living.</p>

<p>Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction.</p>
<p>A man cannot even maintain his physical body without work.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many pseudo-meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna did not want Arjuna to become a pretender, but that he perform his prescribed duties as set forth for ksatriyas.</p>
<p>Arjuna was a householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder ksatriya.</p>
<p>Such activities gradually cleanse the heart of a mundane man and free him from material contamination.</p>
<p>So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture.</p>
<p>After all, one has to maintain one's body and soul together by some work.</p>
<p>Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities.</p>
<p>Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Such polluted propensities have to be cleared.</p>
<p>Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others.</p>

<p>Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.</p>
<p>Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Yajna means Lord Visnu, or sacrificial performances.</p>
<p>All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>The Vedas enjoin: yajno vai visnuh.</p>
<p>In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed yajnas or directly serves Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is therefore performance of yajna as it is prescribed in this verse.</p>
<p>The varnasrama institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>"Varnasramacara-vata purusena parah puman visnur aradhyate..." (Visnu Purana 3.8.8) Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Visnu.</p>
<p>Any other work done in this material world wilI be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to work in Krsna consciousness to satisfy Krsna (or Visnu); and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage.</p>
<p>This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance.</p>
<p>One should therefore act very diligently, under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord Krsna, or under the direct instruction of Lord Krsna Himself (under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work).</p>
<p>Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Krsna.</p>
<p>This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work, but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of creation, the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods, along with sacrifices for Visnu, and blessed them by saying, "Be thou happy by this yajna [sacrifice] because its performance will bestow upon you all desirable things."</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material creation by the Lord of creatures (Visnu) is a chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back home--back to Godhead.</p>
<p>All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relation as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita: vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah.</p>
<p>The Lord says that the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Him.</p>
<p>In the Vedic hymns it is said: patim visvasyatmesvaram.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam also Srila Sukadeva Gosvami describes the Lord as pati in so many ways:</p>
<p>sriyah-patir yajna-patih praja-patir dhiyam patir loka-patir dhara-patih patir gatis candhaka-vrsni-satvatam prasidatam me bhagavan satam patih (Bhag.2.4.20)</p>
<p>The praja-pati is Lord Visnu, and He is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and the protector of everyone.</p>
<p>The Lord created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform yajnas (sacrifice) for the satisfaction of Visnu, so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety.</p>
<p>Then after finishing the present material body, they can enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>That is the whole program for the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>By performance of yajna, the conditioned souls gradually become Krsna conscious and become godly in all respects.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, the sankirtana-yajna (the chanting of the names of God) is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya for the deliverance of all men in this age.</p>
<p>Sankirtana-yajna and Krsna consciousness go well together.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna in His devotional form (as Lord Caitanya) is mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam as follows, with special reference to the sankirtana-yajna:</p>

<p>The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you; thus nourishing one another, there will reign general prosperity for all.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs.</p>
<p>The supply of air, light, water and all other benedictions for maintaining the body and soul of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods, who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Their pleasures and displeasures are dependant on the performance of yajnas by the human being.</p>
<p>Some of the yajnas are meant to satisfy particular demigods; but even in so doing, Lord Visnu is worshiped in all yajnas as the chief beneficiary.</p>
<p>It is stated also in the Bhagavad-gita that Krsna Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of yajnas: bhoktaram yajna-tapasam.</p>
<p>Therefore, ultimate satisfaction of the yajnapati is the chief purpose of all yajnas.</p>
<p>When these yajnas are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments of supply are pleased, and there is no scarcity in the supply of natural products.</p>
<p>Performance of yajnas has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation from the material bondage.</p>
<p>By performance of yajnas, all activities become purified, as it is stated in the Vedas:</p>
<p>ahara-suddhau sattva-suddhih sattva-suddhau dhruva smrtih smrti-lambhe sarva-granthinam vipra-moksah</p>
<p>As it will be explained in the following verse, by performance of yajna, one's eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs, one's very existence becomes purified; by the purification of existence, finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and when memory is sanctified, one can think of the path of liberation, and all these combined together lead to Krsna consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of yajna [sacrifice], supply all necessities to man.</p>
<p>But he who enjoys these gifts, without offering them to the demigods in return, is certainly a thief.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods are authorized supplying agents on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore, they must be satisfied by the performance of prescribed yajnas.</p>
<p>In the Vedas, there are different kinds of yajnas prescribed for different kinds of demigods, but all are ultimately offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended.</p>
<p>According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yajnas are recommended in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis--namely, according to different qualities.</p>
<p>For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddess Kali, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended.</p>
<p>But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship of Visnu is recommended.</p>
<p>But ultimately, all yajnas are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position.</p>
<p>For ordinary men, at least five yajnas, known as panca-mahayajna, are necessary.</p>
<p>One should know, however, that all the necessities of life that the human society requires are supplied by the demigod agents of the Lord.</p>
<p>No one can manufacture anything.</p>
<p>Take, for example, all the eatables of human society.</p>
<p>These eatables include grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, sugar, etc., for the persons in the mode of goodness, and also eatables for the nonvegetarians, like meats, etc., none of which can be manufactured by men.</p>
<p>Then again, take for example heat, light, water, air, etc., which are also necessities of life--none of them can be manufactured by the human society.</p>
<p>Without the Supreme Lord, there can be no profuse sunlight, moonlight, rainfall, breeze, etc., without which no one can live.</p>
<p>Obviously, our life is dependant on supplies from the Lord.</p>
<p>Even for our manufacturing enterprises, we require so many raw materials like metal, sulphur, mercury, manganese, and so many essentials--all of which are supplied by the agents of the Lord, with the purpose that we should make proper use of them to keep ourselves fit and healthy for the purpose of self-realization, leading to the ultimate goal of life, namely, liberation from the material struggle for existence.</p>
<p>This aim of life is attained by performance of yajnas.</p>
<p>If we forget the purpose of human life and simply take supplies from the agents of the Lord for sense gratification and become more and more entangled in material existence, which is not the purpose of creation, certainly we become thieves, and therefore we are punished by the laws of material nature.</p>
<p>A society of thieves can never be happy because they have no aim in life.</p>
<p>The gross materialist thieves have no ultimate goal of life.</p>
<p>They are simply directed to sense gratification; nor do they have knowledge of how to perform yajnas.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya, however, inaugurated the easiest performance of yajna, namely the sankirtana-yajna, which can be performed by anyone in the world who accepts the principles of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice.</p>
<p>Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The devotees of the Supreme Lord, or the persons who are in Krsna consciousness, are called santas, and they are always in love with the Lord as it is described in the Brahma-samhita: premanjana- cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti.</p>
<p>The santas, being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (the giver of all pleasures), or Mukunda (the giver of liberation), or Krsna (the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Therefore, such devotees always perform yajnas in different modes of devotional service, such as sravanam, kirtanam, smaranam, arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajnas keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world.</p>
<p>Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves, but are also the eaters of all kinds of sins.</p>
<p>How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process of sankirtana-yajna, in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there can be no peace or happiness in the world.</p>

<p>All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rain.</p>
<p>Rains are produced by performance of yajna [sacrifice], and yajna is born of prescribed duties.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Baladeva Vidyabhusana, a great commentator on the Bhagavad-gita, writes as follows: ye indrady-anga-tayavasthitam yajnam sarvesvaram visnum abhyarccya tacchesam asnanti tena taddeha-yantram sampadayanti te santah sarvesvarasya bhaktah sarva-kilvisair anadi-kala-vivrddhair atmanubhava- pratibandhakair nikhilaih papair vimucyante.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord, who is known as the yajna-purusah, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole.</p>
<p>Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuna, etc., are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains.</p>
<p>When Lord Krsna is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods.</p>
<p>For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in Krsna consciousness, offer food to Krsna and then eat--a process which nourishes the body spiritually.</p>
<p>By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature.</p>
<p>When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic.</p>
<p>Similarly, food offered to Lord Visnu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, a person in Krsna consciousness, who eats only food offered to Krsna, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins.</p>
<p>The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by accepting prasadam of the Lord (food offered to Visnu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination.</p>
<p>Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables.</p>
<p>The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc.</p>
<p>Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals.</p>
<p>Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories.</p>
<p>The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity--that is the law of nature.</p>
<p>Yajna, specifically the sankirtana-yajna prescribed for this age, must therefore be performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Regulated activities are prescribed in the Vedas, and the Vedas are directly manifested from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Consequently the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Yajnartha karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction of Krsna only, is more expressly stated in this verse.</p>
<p>If we have to work for the satisfaction of the yajna-purusa, Visnu, then we must find out the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental Vedas.</p>
<p>The Vedas are therefore codes of working directions.</p>
<p>Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is called vikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work.</p>
<p>As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly, one has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord.</p>
<p>Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is said: asya mahato bhutasya nasvasitam etad yad rg-vedo yajur-vedah sama-vedo 'tharvan girasah.</p>
<p>"The four Vedas--namely the Rg-veda, Yajur-veda, Sama-veda and Atharva-veda--are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead."</p>
<p>The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, as it is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita, for the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses.</p>
<p>In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes.</p>
<p>In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities.</p>
<p>After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one's perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment.</p>
<p>It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of yajna by becoming Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Even those who cannot follow the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of Krsna consciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic yajnas, or karmas.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear Arjuna, a man who does not follow this prescribed Vedic system of sacrifice certainly leads a life of sin, for a person delighting only in the senses lives in vain.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is condemned herein by the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yajnas is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more.</p>
<p>By nature's law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways--namely karma-yoga, jnana-yoga, or bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yajnas for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of yajna performances.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of activities.</p>
<p>Those who are not Krsna conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work.</p>
<p>The yajna system is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work.</p>
<p>The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods.</p>
<p>Therefore, the yajnas are directly aimed at the particular demigod mentioned in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Indirectly, it is the practice of Krsna consciousness, because when one masters the performance of yajnas, one is sure to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>But if by performing yajnas one does not become Krsna conscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attain Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>Janaka was the father of Sita, and father-in-law of Lord Sri Rama.</p>

<p>One who teaches in that way is called acarya, or the ideal teacher.</p>
<p>Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles of sastra (scripture) to reach the common man.</p>
<p>The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>The revealed scriptures, like Manu-samhita and similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society.</p>

<p>He is also worshipable by all demigods and is the supreme director of all directors.</p>
<p>Therefore, He is transcendental to all kinds of material leaders and controllers and is worshipable by all.</p>
<p>There is no one greater than Him, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.</p>
<p>"He does not possess bodily form like that of an ordinary living entity.</p>
<p>There is no difference between His body and His soul.</p>
<p>He is absolute.</p>
<p>All His senses are transcendental.</p>
<p>Any one of His senses can perform the action of any other sense.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one is greater than Him or equal to Him.</p>
<p>His potencies are multifarious, and thus His deeds are automatically performed as a natural sequence." (Svetasvatara Upanisad 6.7-8)</p>
<p>Since everything is in full opulence in the Personality of Godhead and is existing in full truth, there is no duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead to perform.</p>
<p>One who must receive the results of work has some designated duty, but one who has nothing to achieve within the three planetary systems certainly has no duty.</p>
<p>And yet Lord Krsna is engaged on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra as the leader of the ksatriyas because the ksatriyas are duty-bound to give protection to the distressed.</p>
<p>Although He is above all the regulations of the revealed scriptures, He does not do anything that violates the revealed scriptures.</p>

<p>Otherwise, common men would follow in His footsteps because He is the greatest authority.</p>

<p>If I should cease to work, then all these worlds would be put to ruination.</p>
<p>I would also be the cause of creating unwanted population, and I would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Varna-sankara is unwanted population which disturbs the peace of the general society.</p>
<p>In order to check this social disturbance, there are prescribed rules and regulations by which the population can automatically become peaceful and organized for spiritual progress in life.</p>
<p>When Lord Krsna descends, naturally He deals with such rules and regulations in order to maintain the prestige and necessity of such important performances.</p>
<p>The Lord is the father of all living entities, and if the living entities are misguided, indirectly the responsibility goes to the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever there is general disregard of regulative principles, the Lord Himself descends and corrects the society.</p>
<p>We should, however, note carefully that although we have to follow in the footsteps of the Lord, we still have to remember that we cannot imitate Him.</p>
<p>Following and imitating are not on the same level.</p>
<p>We cannot imitate the Lord by lifting Govardhana Hill, as the Lord did in His childhood.</p>
<p>It is impossible for any human being.</p>
<p>We have to follow His instructions, but we may not imitate Him at any time.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam affirms:</p>
<p>naitat samacarej jatu manasapi hy anisvarah vinasyaty acaran maudhyad yatha 'rudro 'bdhijam visam</p>
<p>isvaranam vacah satyam tathaivacaritam kvacit tesam yat sva-vaco yuktam buddhimams tat samacaret</p>
<p>"One should simply follow the instructions of the Lord and His empowered servants.</p>
<p>Their instructions are all good for us, and any intelligent person will perform them as instructed.</p>
<p>However, one should guard against trying to imitate their actions.</p>
<p>One should not try to drink the ocean of poison in imitation of Lord Siva." (Bhag.10.33.30)</p>
<p>We should always consider the position of the isvaras, or those who can actually control the movements of the sun and moon, as superior.</p>
<p>Without such power, one cannot imitate the isvaras, who are superpowerful.</p>
<p>Lord Siva drank poison to the extent of swallowing an ocean, but if any common man tries to drink even a fragment of such poison, he will be killed.</p>
<p>There are many psuedo-devotees of Lord Siva who want to indulge in smoking ganja (marijuana) and similar intoxicating drugs, forgetting that by so imitating the acts of Lord Siva they are calling death very near.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are some psuedo-devotees of Lord Krsna who prefer to imitate the Lord in His rasa-lila, or dance of love, forgetting their inability to lift Govardhana Hill.</p>
<p>It is best, therefore, that one not try to imitate the powerful, but simply follow their instructions; nor should one try to occupy their posts without qualification.</p>
<p>There are so many "incarnations" of God without the power of the Supreme Godhead.</p>

<p>All rituals, all performances of sacrifices, and everything that is put into the Vedas, including all directions for material activities, are meant for understanding Krsna, who is the ultimate goal of life.</p>
<p>But because the conditioned souls do not know anything beyond sense gratification, they study the Vedas to that end.</p>
<p>Through sense regulations, however, one is gradually elevated to Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore a realized soul in Krsna consciousness should not disturb others in their activities or understanding, but he should act by showing how the results of all work can be dedicated to the service of Krsna.</p>
<p>The learned Krsna conscious person may act in such a way that the ignorant person working for sense gratification may learn how to act and how to behave.</p>
<p>Although the ignorant man is not to be disturbed in his activities, still, a slightly developed Krsna conscious person may directly be engaged in the service of the Lord without waiting for other Vedic formulas.</p>
<p>For this fortunate man there is no need to follow the Vedic rituals, because in direct Krsna consciousness one can have all the results simply by following the prescribed duties of a particular person.</p>

<p>The ignorant man forgets that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Hrsikesa, or the master of the senses of the material body, for due to his long misuse of the senses in sense gratification, he is factually bewildered by the false ego, which makes him forget his eternal relationship with Krsna.</p>

<p>Persons who are unknowledgeable falsely identify with gross material consciousness and are full of material designations.</p>
<p>This body is a gift of the material nature, and one who is too much attached to the bodily consciousness is called mandan, or a lazy person without understanding of spirit soul.</p>

<p>Those who are, however, enlightened in spiritual life, should not try to agitate such materially engrossed persons.</p>
<p>Better to prosecute one's own spiritual activities silently.</p>
<p>Men who are ignorant cannot appreciate activities in Krsna consciousness, and therefore Lord Krsna advises us not to disturb them and simply waste valuable time.</p>
<p>But the devotees of the Lord are more kind than the Lord because they understand the purpose of the Lord.</p>
<p>Consequently they undertake all kinds of risks, even to the point of approaching ignorant men to try to engage them in the acts of Krsna consciousness, which are absolutely necessary for the human being.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, O Arjuna, surrendering all your works unto Me, with mind intent on Me, and without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy, fight.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The Lord instructs that one has to become fully Krsna conscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline.</p>
<p>Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence on Krsna, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity.</p>
<p>The living entity cannot be happy independant of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord.</p>
<p>Arjuna was, therefore, ordered by Sri Krsna to fight as if the Lord were his military commander.</p>
<p>One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship.</p>
<p>Arjuna did not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the Soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fully Krsna conscious, is called adhyatma-cetasa.</p>
<p>Nirasih means that one has to act on the order of the master.</p>
<p>Nor should one ever expect fruitive results.</p>
<p>The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself.</p>
<p>Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>That is the real purport of mayi, or unto Me.</p>
<p>And when one acts in such Krsna consciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything.</p>
<p>This consciousness is called nirmama, or nothing is mine.</p>
<p>And, if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may become vigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy.</p>
<p>Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged in Krsna consciousness, as described above.</p>
<p>That will lead one to the path of liberation.</p>

<p>The injunction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the essence of all Vedic wisdom, and therefore is eternally true without exception.</p>
<p>As the Vedas are eternal, so this truth of Krsna consciousness is also eternal.</p>
<p>One should have firm faith in this injunction, without envying the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-gita but have no faith in Krsna.</p>
<p>They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action.</p>
<p>But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law of karma.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is situated on the transcendental platform of Krsna consciousness, he cannot get free from the influence of the modes of material nature, as it is confirmed by the Lord in the Seventh Chapter (7.14).</p>
<p>Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement of maya simply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body.</p>
<p>There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose to be advanced in the science, but inwardly or privately are completely under the particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass.</p>
<p>Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties.</p>
<p>Therefore, without being fully in Krsna consciousness, no one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-called yogi or transcendentalist artificially.</p>
<p>It is better to be situated in one's position and to try to attain Krsna consciousness under superior training.</p>

<p>Attraction and repulsion for sense objects are felt by embodied beings, but one should not fall under the control of senses and sense objects because they are stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who are in Krsna consciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratifications.</p>
<p>But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects.</p>
<p>For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties.</p>
<p>For example, according to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one's wife.</p>
<p>All other women are to be considered as one's mother.</p>
<p>But, in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women.</p>
<p>These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization.</p>
<p>As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations.</p>
<p>And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances.</p>
<p>One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratifications under regulations may also lead one to go astray--as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads.</p>
<p>Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road.</p>
<p>The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association.</p>
<p>Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means.</p>
<p>But action in the loving service of Krsna detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one should try to be detached from Krsna consciousness at any stage of life.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>It is far better to discharge one's prescribed duties, even though they may be faulty, than another's duties.</p>
<p>Destruction in the course of performing one's own duty is better than engaging in another's duties, for to follow another's path is dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in full Krsna consciousness rather than those prescribed for others.</p>
<p>Prescribed duties complement one's psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master, for the transcendental service of Krsna.</p>
<p>But both materially or spiritually, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another's prescribed duties.</p>
<p>Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer.</p>
<p>When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for particular situations and should not imitate others.</p>
<p>For example, a brahmana, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas a ksatriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent.</p>
<p>As such, for a ksatriya it is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate a brahmana who follows the principles of nonviolence.</p>
<p>Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly.</p>
<p>However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated in Krsna consciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of the bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>In that complete stage of Krsna consciousness, the ksatriya may act as a brahmana, or a brahmana may act as a ksatriya.</p>
<p>In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply.</p>
<p>For example, Visvamitra was originally a ksatriya, but later on he acted as a brahmana, whereas Parasurama was a brahmana, but later on he acted as a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>At the same time, he must have a full sense of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>Although the living entity sometimes does not want to act in sin, he is still forced to act.</p>
<p>Sinful actions are not, however, impelled by the Supersoul within, but are due to another cause, as the Lord explains in the next verse.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When a living entity comes in contact with the material creation, his eternal love for Krsna is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion.</p>
<p>Or, in other words, the sense of love of God becomes transformed into lust, as milk in contact with sour tamarind is transformed into yogurt.</p>
<p>Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence.</p>
<p>Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world.</p>
<p>Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the modes of passion, instead of being degraded into the modes of ignorance, are elevated to the modes of goodness by the prescribed method of Iiving and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead expanded Himself into many for His ever-increasing spiritual bliss, and the living entities are parts and parcels of this spiritual bliss.</p>
<p>They also have partial independence, but by misuse of their independence, when the service attitude is transformed into the propensity for sense enjoyment, they come under the sway of lust.</p>
<p>This material creation is created by the Lord to give a facility to the conditioned souls to fulfill these lustful propensities, and when they are completely baffled by prolonged lustful activities, the living entities begin to inquire about their real position.</p>
<p>This inquiry is the beginning of the Vedanta-sutras, wherein it is said, athato brahma-jijnasa: one should inquire into the Supreme.</p>
<p>And the Supreme is defined in Srimad-Bhagavatam as janmadyasya yato 'nvayad itaratas ca, or, "The origin of everything is the Supreme Brahman."</p>
<p>Therefore, the origin of lust is also in the Supreme.</p>
<p>If, therefore, lust is transformed into love for the Supreme, or transformed into Krsna consciousness--or, in other words, desiring everything for Krsna--then both lust and wrath can be spiritualized.</p>
<p>Hanuman, the great servitor of Lord Rama, engaged his wrath upon his enemies for the satisfaction of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, lust and wrath, when they are employed in Krsna consciousness, become our friends instead of our enemies.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, similarly, the living entity is covered by different degrees of this lust.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured.</p>
<p>This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo.</p>
<p>When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived.</p>
<p>In other words, when the living entity exhibits his Krsna consciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke.</p>
<p>Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage.</p>
<p>This stage is like the beginning of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods.</p>
<p>The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord.</p>
<p>The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move.</p>
<p>This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees.</p>
<p>The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness.</p>
<p>The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke covered fire is compared to the human being.</p>
<p>In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a little Krsna consciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life.</p>
<p>By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, the fire can be made to blaze.</p>
<p>Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence.</p>
<p>In the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation of Krsna consciousness under able guidance.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus, a man's pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said in the Manu-smrti that lust cannot be satisfied by any amount of sense enjoyment, just as fire is never extinguished by a constant supply of fuel.</p>
<p>In the material world, the center of all activities is sex, and thus this material world is called maithunya-agara, or the shackles of sex life.</p>
<p>In the ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life.</p>
<p>Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity.</p>
<p>Therefore, this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within the material world.</p>
<p>While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer.</p>

<p>The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust, which veils the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The enemy has captured different strategic positions in the body of the conditioned soul, and therefore Lord Krsna is giving hints of those places, so that one who wants to conquer the enemy may know where he can be found.</p>
<p>Mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus the mind is the reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust.</p>
<p>Next, the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities.</p>
<p>Intelligence is the immediate next-door neighbor of the spirit soul.</p>
<p>Lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the mind and senses.</p>
<p>The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness.</p>
<p>This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in the Srimad-Bhagavatam:</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin [lust] by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord advised Arjuna to regulate the senses from the very beginning so that he could curb the greatest sinful enemy, lust, which destroys the urge for self-realization, and specifically, knowledge of the self.</p>
<p>Jnanam refers to knowledge of self as distinguished from non-self, or, in other words, knowledge that the spirit soul is not the body.</p>
<p>Vijnanam refers to specific knowledge of the spirit soul and knowledge of one's constitutional position and his relationship to the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>It is explained thus in the Srimad-Bhagavatam: jnanam parama-guhyam me yad-vijnana-samanvitam sarahasyam tad-angam ca grhana gaditam maya: "The knowledge of the self and the Supreme Self is very confidential and mysterious, being veiled by maya, but such knowledge and specific realization can be understood if it is explained by the Lord Himself."</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita gives us that knowledge, specifically knowledge of the self.</p>
<p>The living entities are parts and parcels of the Lord, and therefore they are simply meant to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>This consciousness is called Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>So, from the very beginning of life one has to learn this Krsna consciousness, and thereby one may become fully Krsna conscious and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Lust is only the perverted reflection of the love of God which is natural for every living entity.</p>
<p>But if one is educated in Krsna consciousness from the very beginning, that natural love of God cannot deteriorate into lust.</p>
<p>When love of God deteriorates into lust, it is very difficult to return to the normal condition.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Krsna consciousness is so powerful that even a late beginner can become a lover of God by following the regulative principles of devotional service.</p>
<p>So, from any stage of life, or from the time of understanding its urgency, one can begin regulating the senses in Krsna consciousness, devotional service of the Lord, and turn the lust into love of Godhead--the highest perfectional stage of human life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust.</p>
<p>Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses.</p>
<p>Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole.</p>
<p>These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In Krsna consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions.</p>
<p>But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act--as it does during dreaming.</p>
<p>But, above the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged.</p>
<p>In the Katha Upanisad there is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects.</p>
<p>If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways.</p>
<p>This mental attitude has already been explained.</p>
<p>If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities.</p>
<p>In the Katha Upanisad the soul has been described as mahan, the great.</p>
<p>Therefore the soul is above all--namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence.</p>
<p>Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.</p>
<p>With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That solves the whole problem.</p>
<p>A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of senses.</p>
<p>One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence.</p>
<p>If by intelligence one engages one's mind in Krsna consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs.</p>
<p>But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with Krsna in Krsna consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.</p>

<p>Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and intelligence, one should control the lower self by the higher self and thus--by spiritual strength--conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This Third Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita is conclusively directive to Krsna consciousness by knowing oneself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without considering impersonal voidness as the ultimate end.</p>
<p>In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature.</p>
<p>Desire for overlording and sense gratification are the greatest enemies of the conditioned soul; but by the strength of Krsna consciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence.</p>
<p>One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developing Krsna consciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind--by steady intelligence directed toward one's pure identity.</p>
<p>This is the sum total of this chapter.</p>
<p>In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life.</p>
<p>He must be trained in Krsna consciousness by higher intelligence.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Herein we find the history of the Bhagavad-gita traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order, the kings of all planets.</p>
<p>This science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants and therefore the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from the material bondage to lust.</p>
<p>Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion.</p>
<p>In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Krsna consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science and pursue a successful path, utilizing the opportunity of the human form of life.</p>
<p>In this millennium, the sun-god is known as Vivasvan, the king of the sun, which is the origin of all planets within the solar system.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita [Bs.5.52] it is stated:</p>
<p>yac-caksur esa savita sakala-grahanam raja samasta-sura-murttir asesa-tejah yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kalacakro govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>"Let me worship," Lord Brahma said, "the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Krsna], who is the original person and under whose order the sun, which is the king of all planets, is assuming immense power and heat.</p>
<p>The sun represents the eye of the Lord and traverses its orbit in obedience to His order."</p>
<p>The sun is the king of the planets, and the sun-god (at present of the name Vivasvan) rules the sun planet, which is controlling all other planets by supplying heat and light.</p>
<p>He is rotating under the order of Krsna, and Lord Krsna originally made Vivasvan His first disciple to understand the science of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The Gita is not, therefore, a speculative treatise for the insignificant mundane scholar but is a standard book of knowledge coming down from time immemorial.</p>
<p>In the Mahabharata (Santi-parva 348.51-52) we can trace out the history of the Gita as follows:</p>
<p>treta-yugadau ca tato vivasvan manave dadau manus ca loka-bhrty-artham sutayeksvakave dadau iksvakuna ca kathito vyapya lokan avasthitah</p>
<p>"In the beginning of the Treta-yuga [millennium] this science of the relationship with the Supreme was delivered by Vivasvan to Manu.</p>
<p>Manu, being the father of mankind, gave it to his son Maharaja Iksvaku, the King of this earth planet and forefather of the Raghu dynasty in which Lord Ramacandra appeared.</p>
<p>Therefore, Bhagavad-gita existed in the human society from the time of Maharaja Iksvaku."</p>
<p>At the present moment we have just passed through five thousand years of the Kali-yuga, which lasts 432,000 years.</p>
<p>Before this there was Dvapara-yuga (800,000 years), and before that there was Treta-yuga (1,200,000 years).</p>
<p>Thus, some 2,005,000 years ago, Manu spoke the Bhagavad-gita to his disciple and son Maharaja lksvaku, the King of this planet earth.</p>
<p>The age of the current Manu is calculated to last some 305,300,000 years, of which 120,400,000 have passed.</p>
<p>Accepting that before the birth of Manu, the Gita was spoken by the Lord to His disciple, the sun-god Vivasvan, a rough estimate is that the Gita was spoken at least 120,400,000 years ago; and in human society it has been extant for two million years.</p>
<p>It was respoken by the Lord again to Arjuna about five thousand years ago.</p>
<p>That is the rough estimate of the history of the Gita, according to the Gita itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>It was spoken to the sun-god Vivasvan because he is also a ksatriya and is the father of all ksatriyas who are descendants of the sun-god, or the surya-vamsa ksatriyas.</p>
<p>Because Bhagavad-gita is as good as the Vedas, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is apauruseya, superhuman.</p>
<p>Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the Gita must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation.</p>
<p>The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gita in their own ways, but that is not Bhagavad-gita as it is.</p>
<p>Therefore, Bhagavad-gita has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Iksvaku.</p>

<p>This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.</p>
<p>But in course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is clearly stated that the Gita was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens.</p>
<p>Certainly Bhagavad-gita was never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one's benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims.</p>
<p>As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the Gita appeared to be lost.</p>
<p>In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the Gita (especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession.</p>
<p>There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, although they make a good business on the words of Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Since there is a great need of an edition of the Gita in English, as it is received by the parampara (disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita--accepted as it is--is a great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time.</p>

<p>The Lord selected Arjuna as the recipient of this great science owing to his becoming the devotee of the Lord, but for the demon it is not possible to understand this great mysterious science.</p>
<p>There are a number of editions of this great book of knowledge, and some of them have commentaries by the devotees, and some of them have commentaries by the demons.</p>
<p>Commentation by the devotees is real, whereas that of the demons is useless.</p>
<p>Arjuna accepts Sri Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and any commentary on the Gita following in the footsteps of Arjuna is real devotional service to the cause of this great science.</p>
<p>The demonic, however, concoct something about Krsna and mislead the public and general readers from the path of Krsna's instructions.</p>
<p>One should try to follow the disciplic succession from Arjuna, and thus be benefitted.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvan is senior by birth to You.</p>
<p>How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna is an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believe Krsna's words? The fact is that Arjuna is not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea that Krsna should be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them only Arjuna inquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, or Krsna.</p>
<p>As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter, Arjuna knew perfectly well that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in Transcendence.</p>
<p>Of course, Krsna also appeared as the son of Devaki on this earth.</p>
<p>How Krsna remained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal, original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand.</p>
<p>Therefore, to clarify this point, Arjuna put this question before Krsna so that He Himself could speak authoritatively.</p>
<p>That Krsna is the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present, but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him.</p>
<p>Anyway, since Krsna is the authority accepted by all, Arjuna put this question before Him in order that Krsna would describe Himself without being depicted by the demons who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers.</p>
<p>It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science of Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Krsna Himself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds.</p>
<p>To the demons, such explanations by Krsna Himself may appear to be strange because the demons always study Krsna from their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements of Krsna when they are spoken by Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements of Krsna because they are always eager to know more and more about Him.</p>
<p>The atheists, who consider Krsna an ordinary man, may in this way come to know that Krsna is superhuman, that He is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha--the eternal form of bliss and knowledge--that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space.</p>
<p>A devotee of Krsna's, like Arjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position of Krsna.</p>
<p>Arjuna's putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who consider Krsna to be an ordinary human being subject to the modes of material nature.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord it is stated there:</p>
<p>advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca vedesu durllabham adurllabham atma-bhaktau govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami. (Bs.5.33)</p>
<p>"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Krsna], who is the original person--absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth.</p>
<p>Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually understood by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees."</p>
<p>It is also stated in Brahma-samhita:</p>
<p>ramadi murttisu kala-niyamena tisthan nanavataram akarod bhuvanesu kintu krsnah svayam samabhavat paramah puman yo govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami (Bs.5.39)</p>
<p>"I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Krsna], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rama, Nrsimha and many sub-incarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Krsna, and who incarnates personally also."</p>
<p>In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, nevertheless manifests Himself in innumerable forms.</p>
<p>He is like the vaidurya stone, which changes color yet still remains one.</p>
<p>All those multi-forms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas: vedesu durllabham adurllabham atma-bhaktau.</p>
<p>Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities.</p>
<p>Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Krsna spoke the Bhagavad-gita to the sun-god Vivasvan, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present.</p>
<p>But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incidence, whereas Arjuna could not remember.</p>
<p>That is the difference between the part and parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births.</p>
<p>Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is described in the Brahma-samhita as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna.</p>
<p>Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature.</p>
<p>Consequently these descriptions in the Gita cannot be understood by demonic brains.</p>
<p>Krsna remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Krsna and Arjuna are eternal in nature.</p>
<p>We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-ananda body.</p>
<p>He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself.</p>
<p>Everything in relation to Him is spirit--whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body.</p>
<p>And, because the Lord's body and self are identical, His position is always different from the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform.</p>
<p>The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, as the Lord explains in the following verse.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#46" id="46">4.6</a></h3>

<p>ajah--unborn; api--although; san--being so; avyaya--without deterioration; atma--body; bhutanam--all those who are born; isvarah--the Supreme Lord; api--although; san--being so; prakrtim--transcendental form; svam--of Myself; adhisthaya--being so situated; sambhavami--I do incarnate; atma-mayaya--by My internal energy.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord has spoken about the peculiarity of His birth: although He may appear like an ordinary person, He remembers everything of His many, many past "births," whereas a common man cannot remember what he has done even a few hours before.</p>
<p>If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately.</p>
<p>He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before.</p>
<p>And yet, men often dare claim to be God, or Krsna.</p>
<p>One should not be misled by such meaningless claims.</p>
<p>Then again, the Lord explains His prakrti or His form.</p>
<p>Prakrti means nature as well as svarupa, or one's own form.</p>
<p>The Lord says that He appears in His own body.</p>
<p>He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth.</p>
<p>In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another.</p>
<p>The Lord, however, does not do so.</p>
<p>Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency.</p>
<p>In other words, Krsna appears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute.</p>
<p>He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world.</p>
<p>Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity.</p>
<p>Despite the fact Lord Krsna grows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth, astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth.</p>
<p>At the time of the Battle of Kuruksetra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations.</p>
<p>Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>We never see a picture of Krsna in old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation--past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence.</p>
<p>Factually, His appearance and disappearance is like the sun's rising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight.</p>
<p>When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon.</p>
<p>Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky.</p>
<p>And, because His appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency--and He is never contaminated by material nature.</p>
<p>The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn, yet He still appears to take His birth in multi-manifestations.</p>
<p>The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavatam, He appears before His mother as Narayana, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences.</p>
<p>His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, according to the Visvakosa dictionary.</p>
<p>The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body.</p>
<p>He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body.</p>
<p>A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world.</p>
<p>This is explained in the next verse.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#47" id="47">4.7</a></h3>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word srjami is significant herein.</p>
<p>Srjami cannot be used in the sense of creation because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord's form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent.</p>
<p>Therefore srjami means that the Lord manifests Himself as He is.</p>
<p>Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of Dvapara-yuga of the twenty-eighth millennium of the eighth Manu, in one day of Brahma, still He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will.</p>
<p>He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion.</p>
<p>Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavatam it is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord.</p>
<p>Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion.</p>
<p>The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself to Brahma, from within his heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, the principles of dharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmam tu saksat-bhagavat-pranitam).</p>
<p>These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of the Gita, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more.</p>
<p>The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and, whenever such principles are disturbed by the demonic, the Lord appears.</p>
<p>From the Bhagavatam we understand that Lord Buddha is the incarnation of Krsna who appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>Lord Buddha appeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence.</p>
<p>Therefore each and every avatara, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>No one should be accepted as an avatara unless he is referred to by scriptures.</p>
<p>It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil.</p>
<p>He can advent Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear.</p>
<p>In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances.</p>
<p>But the mission is the same--to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion.</p>
<p>Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form.</p>
<p>The principles of the Bhagavad-gita were spoken to Arjuna, and, for that matter, to other highly elevated persons, because he was highly advanced compared to ordinary persons in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Two plus two equals four is a mathematical principle that is true both in the beginner's arithmetic class and in the advanced class as well.</p>
<p>Still, there are higher and lower mathematics.</p>
<p>In all incarnations of the Lord, therefore, the same principles are taught, but they appear to be higher and lower in varied circumstances.</p>
<p>The higher principles of religion begin with the acceptance of the four orders and the four statuses of social life, as will be explained later.</p>
<p>The whole purpose of the mission of incarnations is to arouse Krsna consciousness everywhere.</p>
<p>Such consciousness is manifest and nonmanifest only under different circumstances.</p>

<p>In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Bhagavad-gita, a sadhu (holyman) is a man in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications of Krsna consciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be a sadhu.</p>
<p>And duskrtam applies to one who doesn't care for Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Such miscreants, or duskrtam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education; whereas another person, who is one hundred percent engaged in Krsna consciousness, is accepted as sadhu, even though such a person may neither be learned nor well cultured.</p>
<p>As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demons Ravana and Kamsa.</p>
<p>The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons.</p>
<p>But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demonic.</p>
<p>The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin.</p>
<p>Although Prahlada Maharaja was the son of Hiranyakasipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; although Devaki, the mother of Krsna, was the sister of Kamsa, she and her husband Vasudeva were persecuted only because Krsna was to be born of them.</p>
<p>So Lord Krsna appeared primarily to deliver Devaki, rather than kill Kamsa, but both were performed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations.</p>
<p>In the Caitanya-caritamrta of Krsnadasa Kaviraja, the following verses summarize these principles of incarnation:</p>
<p>srsti-hetu yei murti prapance avatare sei isvara-murti 'avatara' nama dhare mayatita paravyome savara avasthana visve 'avatari' dhare 'avatara' nama.</p>
<p>"The avatara, or incarnation of Godhead, descends from the kingdom of God for material manifestation.</p>
<p>And the particular form of the Personality of Godhead who so descends is called an incarnation, or avatara.</p>
<p>Such incarnations are situated in the spiritual world, the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>When they descend to the material creation, they assume the name avatara."</p>
<p>There are various kinds of avataras, such as purusavataras, gunavataras, lilavataras, saktyavesa avataras, manvantara-avataras and yugavataras--all appearing on schedule all over the universe.</p>
<p>But Lord Krsna is the primeval Lord, the fountainhead of all avataras.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna descends for the specific purposes of mitigating the anxieties of the pure devotees, who are very anxious to see Him in His original Vrndavana pastimes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the prime purpose of the Krsna avatara is to satisfy His unalloyed devotees.</p>
<p>The Lord says that He incarnates Himself in every millennium.</p>
<p>This indicates that He incarnates also in the age of Kali.</p>
<p>As stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, the incarnation in the age of Kali is Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who spread the worship of Krsna by the sankirtana movement (congregational chanting of the holy names), and spread Krsna consciousness throughout India.</p>
<p>He predicted that this culture of sankirtana would be broadcast all over the world, from town to town and village to village.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya as the incarnation of Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, is described secretly but not directly in the confidential parts of the revealed scriptures, such as the Upanisads, Mahabharata, Bhagavatam, etc.</p>
<p>The devotees of Lord Krsna are much attracted by the sankirtana movement of Lord Caitanya.</p>
<p>This avatara of the Lord does not kill the miscreants, but delivers them by the causeless mercy of the Lord.</p>

<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord's descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th verse.</p>
<p>One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body.</p>
<p>Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy.</p>
<p>The impersonalists and the yogis attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births.</p>
<p>Even then, the liberation they achieve--merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord--is only partial, and there is the risk of returning again to this material world.</p>
<p>But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning again to this material world.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations: advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam.</p>
<p>Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers.</p>
<p>As stated in the Vedas:</p>
<p>eko devo nitya-lilanurakto bhakta-vyapi hrdy antaratma.</p>
<p>"The one Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally engaged in many, many transcendental forms in relationships with His unalloyed devotees."</p>
<p>This Vedic version is confirmed in this verse of the Gita personally by the Lord.</p>
<p>He who accepts this truth on the strength of the authority of the Vedas and of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who does not waste time in philosophical speculations attains the highest perfectional stage of liberation.</p>
<p>Simply by accepting this truth on faith, one can, without a doubt, attain liberation.</p>
<p>The Vedic version, "tattvamasi," is actually applied in this case.</p>
<p>Anyone who understands Lord Krsna to be the Supreme, or who says unto the Lord, "You are the same Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead" is certainly liberated instantly, and consequently his entrance into the transcendental association of the Lord is guaranteed.</p>
<p>In other words, such a faithful devotee of the Lord attains perfection, and this is confirmed by the following Vedic assertion:</p>
<p>tam eva viditvatimrtyumeti nanyah pantha vidyate ayanaya.</p>
<p>One can attain the perfect stage of liberation from birth and death simply by knowing the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>There is no alternative because anyone who does not understand Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is surely in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>Consequently he will not attain salvation, simply, so to speak, by licking the outer surface of the bottle of honey, or by interpreting the Bhagavad-gita according to mundane scholarship.</p>
<p>Such empiric philosophers may assume very important roles in the material world, but they are not necessarily eligible for liberation.</p>
<p>Such puffed up mundane scholars have to wait for the causeless mercy of the devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>One should therefore cultivate Krsna consciousness with faith and knowledge, and in this way attain perfection.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful.</p>
<p>In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable.</p>
<p>Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme.</p>
<p>Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal.</p>
<p>And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them.</p>
<p>When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void.</p>
<p>Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean.</p>
<p>That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality.</p>
<p>This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence.</p>
<p>Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all.</p>
<p>Being embarassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void.</p>
<p>Such people are in a diseased condition of life.</p>
<p>Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness.</p>
<p>This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision.</p>
<p>One has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that underlies the frustration of life.</p>
<p>To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life.</p>
<p>The last stage of the devotional life is called bhava, or transcendental love of Godhead.</p>
<p>According to Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, the science of devotional service:</p>
<p>adau sraddha tatah sadhu-sango 'tha bhajana-kriya tato 'nartha-nivrttih syat tato nistha rucis tatah athasaktis tato bhavas tatah premabhyudancati sadhakanam ayam premnah pradurbhave bhavet kramah.</p>
<p>"In the beginning one must have a preliminary desire for self-realization.</p>
<p>This will bring one to the stage of trying to associate with persons who are spiritually elevated.</p>
<p>In next stage one becomes initiated by an elevated spiritual master, and under his instruction the neophyte devotee begins the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>By execution of devotional service under the guidance of the spiritual master, one becomes free from all material attachment, attains steadiness in self-realization, and acquires a taste for hearing about the Absolute Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>This taste leads one further forward to attachment for Krsna consciousness, which is matured in bhava, or the preliminary stage of transcendental love of God.</p>
<p>Real love for God is called prema, the highest perfectional stage of life."</p>
<p>In the prema stage there is constant engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>So, by the slow process of devotional service, under the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, one can attain the highest stage, being freed from all material attachment, from the fearfulness of one's individual spiritual personality, and from the frustrations resulting from void philosophy.</p>
<p>Then one can ultimately attain to the abode of the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>All of them--as they surrender unto Me--I reward accordingly.</p>
<p>Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Eveyone is searching for Krsna in the different aspects of His manifestations.</p>
<p>Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is partially realized in His impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence and as the all-pervading Supersoul dwelling within everything, including the particles of atoms.</p>
<p>But Krsna is only fully realized by His pure devotees.</p>
<p>Consequently, Krsna is the object of everyone's realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one's desire to have Him.</p>
<p>In the transcendental world also, Krsna reciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him.</p>
<p>One devotee may want Krsna as supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son, and still another as his lover.</p>
<p>Krsna rewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him.</p>
<p>In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers.</p>
<p>The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service.</p>
<p>As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity, Krsna helps also by absorbing them into His effulgence.</p>
<p>Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality.</p>
<p>Some of them, who are not situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities.</p>
<p>They are not admitted in the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets.</p>
<p>For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the yajnesvara; and those who are yogis seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers.</p>
<p>In other words, everyone is dependant for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path.</p>
<p>Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection of Krsna consciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in the Srimad Bhagavatam:</p>
<p>akamah sarva-kamo va moksa-kama udaradhih tivrena bhakti-yogena yajeta purusam param</p>
<p>"Whether one is without desire [the condition of the devotees], or is desirous of all fruitive results, or is after liberation, one should with all efforts try to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead for complete perfection, culminating in Krsna consciousness." (Bhag.2.3.10)</p>

<p>Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they worship the demigods.</p>
<p>Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is a great misconception about the gods or demigods of this material world, and men of less intelligence, although passing as great scholars, take these demigods to be various forms of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God's different parts and parcels.</p>
<p>God is one, and the parts and parcels are many.</p>
<p>The Vedas say, nityo nityanam: God is one.</p>
<p>Isvarah paramah krsnah.</p>
<p>The Supreme God is one--Krsna--and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world.</p>
<p>These demigods are all living entities (nityanam) with different grades of material power.</p>
<p>They cannot be equal to the Supreme God--Narayana, Visnu, or Krsna.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, or pasandi.</p>
<p>Even the great demigods like Brahma and Siva cannot be compared to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such as Brahma and Siva (siva-virinci-nutam).</p>
<p>Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism.</p>
<p>Iha devatah denotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world.</p>
<p>But Narayana, Visnu or Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world.</p>
<p>He is above, or transcendental to, material creation.</p>
<p>Even Sripada Sankaracarya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains that Narayana, or Krsna, is beyond this material creation.</p>
<p>However, foolish people (hrt-anjana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results.</p>
<p>They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons.</p>
<p>The intelligent person is in Krsna consciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit.</p>
<p>The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world.</p>
<p>The boons of the demigods are material and temporary.</p>
<p>Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods, and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean.</p>
<p>In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia.</p>
<p>To achieve such temporary things, they worship the demigods or powerful men in human society.</p>
<p>If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon.</p>
<p>All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or "big guns" in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things.</p>
<p>Such foolish men are not interested in Krsna consciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence.</p>
<p>They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods.</p>
<p>This verse indicates that people are rarely interested in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.</p>
<p>And, although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being unchangeable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is the creator of everything.</p>
<p>Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him.</p>
<p>He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called brahmanas due to their being situated in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Next is the administrative class, technically called the ksatriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion.</p>
<p>The mercantile men, called the vaisyas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the sudras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature.</p>
<p>In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord Krsna does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society.</p>
<p>Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired.</p>
<p>Such symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book.</p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness, however, is above even the brahmanas, because a brahmana by quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Most of them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Krsna, but only a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a brahmana and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna, becomes a person in Krsna consciousness--or, in other words, a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of Krsna, namely Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha, etc.</p>
<p>However, as Krsna is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in Krsna consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As there are constitutional laws in the material world stating that the king can do no wrong, or that the king is not subject to the state laws, similarly the Lord, although He is the creator of this material world, is not affected by the activities of the material world.</p>
<p>He creates and remains aloof from the creation, whereas the living entities are entangled in the fruitive results of material activities because of their propensity for lording it over material resources.</p>
<p>The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible.</p>
<p>The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord.</p>
<p>For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death.</p>
<p>The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness.</p>
<p>The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants.</p>
<p>The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire.</p>
<p>He is aloof from the material actions and reactions.</p>
<p>For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth.</p>
<p>Vedic smrti confirms this fact as follows:</p>
<p>nimitta-matram evasau srjyanam sarga-karmani pradhana-karani-bhuta yato vai srjya-saktayah.</p>
<p>In the material creations, the Lord is only the supreme cause.</p>
<p>The immediate cause is material nature by which the cosmic manifestation is visible.</p>
<p>The created beings are of many varieties, such as the demigods, human beings and lower animals, and all of them are subject to the reactions of their past good or bad activities.</p>
<p>The Lord only gives them the proper facilities for such activities and the regulations of the modes of nature, but He is never responsible for their past and present activities.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutras it is confirmed that the Lord is never partial to any living entity.</p>
<p>The living entity is responsible for his own acts.</p>
<p>The Lord only gives him facilities, through the agency of material nature, the external energy.</p>
<p>Anyone who is fully conversant with all the intricacies of this law of karma, or fruitive activities, does not become affected by the results of his activities.</p>
<p>In other words, the person who understands this transcendental nature of the Lord is an experienced man in Krsna consciousness, and thus he is never subjected to the laws of karma.</p>
<p>One who does not know the transcendental nature of the Lord and who thinks that the activities of the Lord are aimed at fruitive results, as are the activities of the ordinary living entities, certainly becomes entangled himself in fruitive reaction.</p>
<p>But one who knows the Supreme Truth is a liberated soul fixed in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>There are two classes of men.</p>
<p>Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons.</p>
<p>Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line of Krsna consciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service.</p>
<p>Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the same Krsna consciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefitted.</p>
<p>Foolish persons or neophytes in Krsna consciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Arjuna's desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord.</p>
<p>One need only know how to act.</p>
<p>To retire from the activities of Krsna consciousness and to sit aloof making a show of Krsna consciousness; is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake of Krsna.</p>
<p>Arjuna is here advised to act in Krsna consciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord's previous disciples, such as the sun-god Vivasvan, as mentioned hereinbefore.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted in Krsna consciousness in the past.</p>
<p>Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before.</p>
<p>All such students of Lord Krsna are mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted by Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Action in Krsna consciousness has to be executed in accord with the examples of previous bona fide devotees.</p>
<p>This is recommended in the 15th verse.</p>
<p>Why such action should not be independant will be explained in the text to follow.</p>
<p>To act in Krsna consciousness, one has to follow the leadership of authorized persons who are in a line of disciplic succession as explained in the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<p>The system of Krsna consciousness was first narrated to the sun-god, the sun-god explained it to his son Manu, Manu explained it to his son Iksvaku, and the system is current on this earth from that very remote time.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to follow in the footsteps of previous authorities in the line of disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Otherwise even the most intelligent men will be bewildered regarding the standard actions of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Lord decided to instruct Arjuna in Krsna consciousness directly.</p>
<p>Because of the direct instruction of the Lord to Arjuna, anyone who follows in the footsteps of Arjuna is certainly not bewildered.</p>
<p>It is said that one cannot ascertain the ways of religion simply by imperfect experimental knowledge.</p>
<p>Actually, the principles of religion can only be laid down by the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Dharmam hi saksat-bhagavat-pranitam.</p>
<p>No one can manufacture a religious principle by imperfect speculation.</p>
<p>One must follow in the footsteps of great authorities like Brahma, Siva, Narada, Manu, Kumara, Kapila, Prahlada, Bhisma, Sukadeva Gosvami, Yamaraja, Janaka, etc.</p>
<p>By mental speculation one cannot ascertain what is religion or self-realization.</p>
<p>Therefore, out of causeless mercy to His devotees, the Lord explains directly to Arjuna what action is and what inaction is.</p>
<p>Only action performed in Krsna consciousness can deliver a person from the entanglement of material existence.</p>

<p>The intricacies of action are very hard to understand.</p>
<p>Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is.</p>
<p>If one is serious about liberation from material bondage, one has to understand the distinctions between action, inaction and unauthorized actions.</p>
<p>One has to apply oneself to such an analysis of action, reaction and perverted actions because it is a very difficult subject matter.</p>
<p>To understand Krsna consciousness and action according to the modes, one has to learn one's relationship with the Supreme; i.e., one who has learned perfectly knows that every living entity is the eternal servitor of the Lord and that consequently one has to act in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The entire Bhagavad-gita is directed toward this conclusion.</p>
<p>Any other conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant reactions, are vikarmas, or prohibitive actions.</p>
<p>To understand all this one has to associate with authorities in Krsna consciousness and learn the secret from them; this is as good as learning from the Lord directly.</p>

<p>He knows that he is part and parcel of the Supreme, and therefore the part played by him, as a part and parcel of the whole, is not his by choice but is chosen for him by the Supreme and is done only through His agency.</p>
<p>When the hand moves, it does not move out of its own accord, but by the endeavor of the whole body.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is always dovetailed with the supreme desire, for he has no desire for personal sense gratification.</p>
<p>He moves exactly like a part of a machine.</p>
<p>As a machine part requires oiling and cleaning for maintenance, similarly, a Krsna conscious man maintains himself by his work just to remain fit for action in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He is therefore immune to all the reactions of his endeavors.</p>
<p>Like an animal, he has no proprietorship even over his own body.</p>
<p>A cruel proprietor of an animal sometimes kills the animal in his possession, yet the animal does not protest.</p>
<p>Nor does it have any real independence.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person, fully engaged in self-realization, has very little time to falsely possess any material object.</p>
<p>For maintaining body and soul, he does not require unfair means of accumulating money.</p>
<p>He does not, therefore, become contaminated by such material sins.</p>
<p>He is free from all reactions to his actions.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person does not make much endeavor even to maintain his body.</p>
<p>He is satisfied with gains which are obtained of their own accord.</p>
<p>He neither begs nor borrows, but he labors honestly as far as is in his power, and is satisfied with whatever is obtained by his own honest labor.</p>
<p>He is therefore independant in his livelihood.</p>
<p>He does not allow anyone's service to hamper his own service in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>However, for the service of the Lord he can participate in any kind of action without being disturbed by the duality of the material world.</p>
<p>The duality of the material world is felt in terms of heat and cold, or misery and happiness.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is above duality because he does not hesitate to act in any way for the satisfaction of Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore he is steady both in success and in failure.</p>
<p>These signs are visible when one is fully in transcendental knowledge.</p>

<p>Becoming fully Krsna conscious, one is freed from all dualities and thus is free from the contaminations of the material modes.</p>
<p>He can become liberated because he knows his constitutional position in relationship with Krsna; and thus his mind cannot be drawn from Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Consequently, whatever he does, he does for Krsna, who is the primeval Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore, all his works are technically sacrifices because sacrifice involves satisfying the Supreme Person, Krsna.</p>
<p>The resultant reactions to all such work certainly merge into transcendence, and one does not suffer material effects.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person who is fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>How activities in Krsna consciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here.</p>
<p>There are various activities in Krsna consciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses.</p>
<p>But, for the present, just the principle of Krsna consciousness is described.</p>
<p>A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment.</p>
<p>The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere is Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds.</p>
<p>The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured by Krsna consciousness as set forth here in the Gita.</p>
<p>This process is generally known as yajna, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction of Visnu or Krsna.</p>
<p>The more the activities of the material world are performed in Krsna consciousness, or for Visnu only, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption.</p>
<p>Brahman means spiritual.</p>
<p>The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence.</p>
<p>Everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when the jyoti is covered by illusion (maya) or sense gratification, it is called material.</p>
<p>This material veil can be removed at once by Krsna consciousness; thus the offering for the sake of Krsna consciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution; the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are--all combined together--Brahman, or the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The Absolute Truth covered by maya is called matter.</p>
<p>Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness into Brahman, or the Supreme.</p>
<p>When the mind is fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness, it is said to be in samadhi, or trance.</p>
<p>Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is called yajna, or sacrifice for the Absolute.</p>
<p>In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance, and the result or ultimate gain--everything--becomes one in the Absolute, the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>That is the method of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Some yogis perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to them, and some of them offer sacrffices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties in Krsna consciousness is also called a perfect yogi or a first-class mystic.</p>
<p>But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the Supreme Brahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories.</p>
<p>Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Factual sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Visnu, who is also known as Yajna.</p>
<p>All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Those who are in Krsna consciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such as Indra, the sun-god, etc.</p>
<p>And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe.</p>
<p>Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals.</p>
<p>They are called bahv-isvara-vadi, or believers in many gods.</p>
<p>But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Such impersonalists spend their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme.</p>
<p>In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme.</p>
<p>For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the Supreme Brahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire of Brahman.</p>
<p>The Krsna conscious person, like Arjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction of Krsna, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self--everything--is sacrificed for Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus, he is the first-class yogi; but he does not lose his individual existence.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Some of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses, such as sound, in the fire of sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The four divisions of human life, namely the brahmacari, the grhastha, the vanaprastha, and the sannyasi, are all meant to help men become perfect yogis or transcendentalists.</p>
<p>Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life.</p>
<p>The brahmacaris, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification.</p>
<p>They are referred to in this verse as sacrificing the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the controlled mind.</p>
<p>A brahmacari hears only words concerning Krsna consciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the pure brahmacari engages fully in harer namanukirtanam--chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>He restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration of Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna.</p>
<p>Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint.</p>
<p>Sex life, intoxication and meat eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratifications.</p>
<p>Marriage on principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life.</p>
<p>This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind of yajna because the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher transcendental life.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The yoga system conceived by Patanjali is referred to herein.</p>
<p>In the Yoga-sutra of Patanjali, the soul is called pratyag-atma and parag-atma.</p>
<p>As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment, it is called parag-atma.</p>
<p>The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system.</p>
<p>The Patanjala system of yoga instructs one on how to control the functions of the body's air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment.</p>
<p>According to this yoga system, pratyag atma is the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>This pratyag atma is a withdrawal from activities in matter.</p>
<p>The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self.</p>
<p>They are called the functions of the prana-vayu.</p>
<p>The apana-vayu goes downwards, vyana-vayu acts to shrink and expand, samana-vayu adjusts equilibrium, udana-vayu goes upwards--and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization.</p>

<p>There are others who, enlightened by sacrificing their material possessions in severe austerities, take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold mysticism, and others study the Vedas for the advancement of transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions.</p>
<p>There are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities.</p>
<p>In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions like dharmasala, anna-ksetra, atithi-sala, anathalaya, vidyapitha, etc.</p>
<p>In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor.</p>
<p>All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yajna.</p>
<p>There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candrayana and caturmasya.</p>
<p>These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules.</p>
<p>For example, under the caturmasya vow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day and does not leave home.</p>
<p>Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yajna.</p>
<p>There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Patanjali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), or hatha-yoga or astanga-yoga (for particular perfections).</p>
<p>And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>All these practices are called yoga-yajna, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world.</p>
<p>There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the Upanisads and Vedanta-sutras, or the sankhya philosophy.</p>
<p>All of these are called svadhyaya-yajna, or engagement in the sacrifice of studies.</p>
<p>All these yogis are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness, is, however, different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifices but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore, Krsna consciousness is transcendental.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>And there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint to remain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing breath into the incoming, and incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance, stopping all breathing.</p>
<p>Some of them, curtailing the eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This system of yoga for controlling the breathing process is called pranayama, and in the beginning it is practiced in the hatha-yoga system through different sitting postures.</p>
<p>All of these processes are recommended for controlling the senses and for advancement in spiritual realization.</p>
<p>This practice involves controlling the air within the body to enable simultaneous passage in opposite directions.</p>
<p>The apana air goes downward, and the prana air goes up.</p>
<p>The pranayama yogi practices breathing the opposite way until the currents are neutralized into puraka, equilibrium.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the exhaled breathing is offered to inhaled breathing, it is called recaka.</p>
<p>When both air currents are completely stopped, it is called kumbhaka-yoga.</p>
<p>By practice of kumbhaka-yoga, the yogis increase the duration of life by many, many years.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person, however, being always situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, automatically becomes the controller of the senses.</p>
<p>His senses, being always engaged in the service of Krsna, have no chance of becoming otherwise engaged.</p>
<p>So at the end of life, he is naturally transferred to the transcendental plane of Lord Krsna; consequently he makes no attempt to increase his longevity.</p>
<p>He is at once raised to the platform of liberation.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person begins from the transcendental stage, and he is constantly in that consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no falling down, and ultimately he enters into the abode of the Lord without delay.</p>
<p>The practice of reduced eating is automatically done when one eats only Krsna prasadam, or food which is offered first to the Lord.</p>
<p>Reducing the eating process is very helpful in the matter of sense control.</p>
<p>And without sense control there is no possibility of getting out of the material entanglement.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the foregoing explanation of differents types of sacrifice (namely sacrifice of one's possessions, study of the Vedas or philosophical doctrines, and performance of the yoga system), it is found that the common aim of all is to control the senses.</p>
<p>Sense gratification is the root cause of material existence; therefore, unless and until one is situated on a platform apart from sense gratification, there is no chance of being elevated to the eternal platform of full knowledge, full bliss and full life.</p>
<p>This platform is in the eternal atmosphere, or Brahman atmosphere.</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned sacrifices help one to become cleansed of the sinful reactions of material existence.</p>
<p>By this advancement in life, one not only becomes happy and opulent in this life, but also, at the end, he enters into the eternal kingdom of God, either merging into the impersonal Brahman or associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>

<p>O best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this planet or in this life: what then of the next?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Whatever form of material existence one is in, one is invariably ignorant of his real situation.</p>
<p>In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives.</p>
<p>Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one's dragging on in material existence.</p>
<p>The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement.</p>
<p>The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely.</p>
<p>The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems.</p>
<p>By performance of yajna we can have enough food, enough milk, etc.--even if there is a so-called increase of population.</p>
<p>When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses.</p>
<p>The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification.</p>
<p>Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Perfection is achieved by performance of yajna (sacrifice), as described above.</p>
<p>Now, if a person is not inclined to perform yajna according to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds of yajna.</p>
<p>But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>A life of Krsna consciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence.</p>

<p>Different types of sacrifice, as discussed above, are mentioned in the Vedas to suit the different types of worker.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of all sacrifices is to arrive at the status of complete knowledge, then to gain release from material miseries, and, ultimately, to engage in loving transcendental service to the Supreme Lord (Krsna consciousness).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery.</p>
<p>Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer.</p>
<p>When one's faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit.</p>
<p>Real knowledge culminates in Krsna consciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities.</p>
<p>When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform.</p>
<p>Depending on differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes called karma-kanda, fruitive activities, and sometimes jnana-kanda, knowledge in the pursuit of truth.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.</p>
<p>Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult.</p>
<p>The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession.</p>
<p>The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple.</p>
<p>No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders.</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam says: dharmam hi saksad-bhagavat-pranitam--the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life.</p>
<p>One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge.</p>
<p>Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige.</p>
<p>Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective.</p>
<p>One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned.</p>
<p>One should not only hear submissively from the spiritual master; but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries.</p>
<p>A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple.</p>
<p>Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>And when you have thus learned the truth, you will know that all living beings are but part of Me--and that they are in Me, and are Mine.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The result of receiving knowledge from a self-realized soul, or one who knows things as they are, is learning that all living beings are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>The sense of a separated existence from Krsna is called maya (ma--not, ya--this).</p>
<p>Some think that we have nothing to do with Krsna, that Krsna is only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, this impersonal Brahman is the personal effulgence of Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is clearly stated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the living entities are also expansions of Krsna.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi philosophers wrongly think that Krsna loses His own separate existence in His many expansions.</p>
<p>This thought is material in nature.</p>
<p>We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity.</p>
<p>But the Mayavadi philosophers fail to understand that Absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one.</p>
<p>This is the case in the absolute world.</p>
<p>For want of sufficient knowledge in the absolute science, we are now covered with illusion, and therefore we think that we are separate from Krsna.</p>
<p>Although we are separated parts of Krsna, we are nevertheless not different from Him.</p>
<p>The bodily difference of the living entities is maya, or not actual fact.</p>
<p>We are all meant to satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>By maya alone Arjuna thought that the temporary bodily relationship with his kinsmen was more important than his eternal spiritual relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>The whole teaching of the Gita is targetted toward this end: that a living being, as His eternal servitor, cannot be separated from Krsna, and his sense of being an identity apart from Krsna is called maya.</p>
<p>The living entities, as separate parts and parcels of the Supreme, have a purpose to fulfill.</p>
<p>Having forgotten that purpose, since time immemorial they are situated in different bodies, as men, animals, demigods, etc.</p>
<p>Such bodily differences arise from forgetfulness of the transcendental service of the Lord.</p>
<p>But when one is engaged in transcendental service through Krsna consciousness, one becomes at once liberated from this illusion.</p>
<p>One can acquire such pure knowledge only from the bona fide spiritual master and thereby avoid the delusion that the living entity is equal to Krsna.</p>
<p>Perfect knowledge is that the Supreme Soul, Krsna, is the supreme shelter for all living entities, and giving up such shelter, the living entities are deluded by the material energy, imagining themselves to have a separate identity.</p>
<p>Thus, under different standards of material identity, they become forgetful of Krsna.</p>
<p>When, however, such deluded living entities become situated in Krsna consciousness, it is to be understood that they are on the path of liberation, as confirmed in the Bhagavatam: muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih.</p>
<p>Liberation means to be situated in one's constitutional position as the eternal servitor of Krsna (Krsna consciousness).</p>

<p>Proper understanding of one's constitutional position in relationship to Krsna is so nice that it can at once lift one from the struggle for existence which goes on in the ocean of nescience.</p>
<p>This material world is sometimes regarded as an ocean of nescience and sometimes as a blazing forest.</p>
<p>In the ocean, however expert a swimmer one may be, the struggle for existence is very severe.</p>
<p>If someone comes forward and lifts the struggling swimmer from the ocean, he is the greatest savior.</p>
<p>Perfect knowledge, received from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the path of liberation.</p>
<p>The boat of Krsna consciousness is very simple, but at the same time the most sublime.</p>

<p>Armed with yoga, O Bharata, stand and fight.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The yoga system instructed in this chapter is called sanatana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity.</p>
<p>This yoga has two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one's material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity.</p>
<p>If sacrifice of one's material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material.</p>
<p>But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice.</p>
<p>When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one's own self (or one's constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One who follows the path of the Gita as it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord.</p>
<p>And such understanding is beneficial for such a person who easily understands the transcendental activities of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself.</p>
<p>One who does not understand the instructions of the Gita is faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord.</p>
<p>In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead, is certainly fool number one.</p>
<p>Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice to Brahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mystic yoga, in penance, in foregoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution called varnasrama-dharma.</p>
<p>All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action.</p>
<p>But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization.</p>
<p>One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-gita, but one who doubts the authority of Krsna falls back.</p>
<p>One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gita, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender.</p>
<p>A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gita have come down to the earthly kingdom.</p>
<p>One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-gita as it is expressed in the Gita itself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path.</p>
<p>The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental.</p>
<p>One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of the Gita.</p>

<p>Arjuna said: O Krsna, first of all You ask me to renounce work, and then again You recommend work with devotion.</p>
<p>Now will You kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more beneficial?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation.</p>
<p>Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction.</p>
<p>In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained.</p>
<p>How to get out of this material encagement by buddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein.</p>
<p>In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform.</p>
<p>And, in the Fourth Chapter, the Lord told Arjuna that all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advised Arjuna to wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge, Krsna has perplexed Arjuna and confused his determination.</p>
<p>Arjuna understands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities.</p>
<p>But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks that sannyasam, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible.</p>
<p>He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction.</p>
<p>He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether, or work with full knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: The renunciation of work and work in devotion are both good for liberation.</p>
<p>But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunciation of works.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Fruitive activities (seeking sense gratification) are cause for material bondage.</p>
<p>As long as one is engaged in activities aimed at improving the standard of bodily comfort, one is sure to transmigrate to different types of bodies, thereby continuing material bondage perpetually.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam confirms this as follows:</p>
<p>nunam pramattah kurute vikarma yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti na sadhu manye yata atmano 'yam asann api klesada asa dehah</p>
<p>parabhavas tavad abodha-jato yavanna jijnasata atma-tattvam yavat kriyas tavad idam mano vai karmatmakam yena sarira-bandhah</p>
<p>evam manah karma-vasam prayunkte avidyayatmany upadhiyamane pritir na yavan mayi vasudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tavat</p>
<p>"People are mad after sense gratification, and they do not know that this present body, which is full of miseries, is a result of one's fruitive activities in the past.</p>
<p>Although this body is temporary, it is always giving one trouble in many ways.</p>
<p>Therefore, to act for sense gratification is not good.</p>
<p>One is considered to be a failure in life as long as he makes no inquiry about the nature of work for fruitive results, for as long as one is engrossed in the consciousness of sense gratification, one has to transmigrate from one body to another.</p>
<p>Although the mind may be engrossed in fruitive activities and influenced by ignorance, one must develop a love for devotional service to Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Only then can one have the opportunity to get out of the bondage of material existence." (Bhag.5.5.4-6)</p>
<p>Therefore, jnana (or knowledge that one is not this material body but spirit soul) is not sufficient for liberation.</p>
<p>One has to act in the status of spirit soul, otherwise there is no escape from material bondage.</p>
<p>Action in Krsna consciousness is not, however, action on the fruitive platform.</p>
<p>Activities performed in full knowledge strengthen one's advancement in real knowledge.</p>
<p>Without Krsna consciousness, mere renunciation of fruitive activities does not actually purify the heart of a conditioned soul.</p>
<p>As long as the heart is not purified, one has to work on the fruitive platform.</p>
<p>But action in Krsna consciousness automatically helps one escape the result of fruitive action so that one need not descend to the material platform.</p>
<p>Therefore, action in Krsna consciousness is always superior to renunciation, which always entails a risk of falling.</p>
<p>Renunciation without Krsna consciousness is incomplete, as is confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu.</p>
<p>prapancikataya buddhya hari-sambandhi-vastunah mumuksubhih parityago vairagyam phalgu kathyate.</p>
<p>"Renunciation by persons eager to achieve liberation of things which are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, though they are material, is called incomplete renunciation."</p>
<p>Renunciation is compete when it is in the knowledge that everything in existence belongs to the Lord and that no one should claim proprietorship over anything.</p>
<p>One should understand that, factually, nothing belongs to anyone.</p>
<p>Then where is the question of renunciation? One who knows that everything is Krsna's property is always situated in renunciation.</p>
<p>Since everything belongs to Krsna, everything should be employed in the service of Krsna.</p>
<p>This perfect form of action in Krsna consciousness is far better than any amount of artificial renunciation by a sannyasi of the Mayavadi school.</p>

<p>One who is fully in Krsna consciousness is always a renouncer because he feels neither hatred nor desire for the results of his actions.</p>
<p>Such a renouncer, dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>He knows fully well that Krsna is the whole and that he is part and parcel of Krsna.</p>
<p>Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct.</p>
<p>The concept of oneness with Krsna is incorrect because the part cannot be equal to the whole.</p>
<p>Knowledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become full in himself, having nothing to aspire to nor lament over.</p>
<p>There is no duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does for Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Only the ignorant speak of karma-yoga and devotional service as being different from the analytical study of the material world [sankhya].</p>
<p>Those who are actually learned say that he who applies himself well to one of these paths achieves the results of both.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The aim of the analytical study of the material world is to find the soul of existence.</p>
<p>The soul of the material world is Visnu, or the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Devotional service to the Lord entails service to the Supersoul.</p>
<p>One process is to find the root of the tree, and next to water the root.</p>
<p>The real student of sankhya philosophy finds the root of the material world, Visnu, and then, in perfect knowledge, engages himself in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, in essence, there is no difference between the two because the aim of both is Visnu.</p>
<p>Those who do not know the ultimate end say that the purposes of sankhya and karma-yoga are not the same, but one who is learned knows the unifying aim in these different processes.</p>

<p>One who knows that the position reached by means of renunciation can also be attained by works in devotional service and who therefore sees that the path of works and the path of renunciation are one, sees things as they are.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life.</p>
<p>Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes.</p>
<p>By sankhya philosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world, but of the supreme spirit whole.</p>
<p>Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme.</p>
<p>When he acts in Krsna consciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position.</p>
<p>In the first process of sankhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotional yoga process one has to attach himself to the work of Krsna.</p>
<p>Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment.</p>
<p>However, detachment from matter and attachment to Krsna are one and the same.</p>
<p>One who can see this sees things as they are.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Unless one is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, mere renunciation of activities cannot make one happy.</p>
<p>The sages, purified by works of devotion, achieve the Supreme without delay.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two classes of sannyasis, or persons in the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi sannyasis are engaged in the study of sankhya philosophy, whereas the Vaisnava sannyasis are engaged in the study of Bhagavatam philosophy, which affords the proper commentary on the Vedanta-sutras.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi sannyasis also study the Vedanta-sutras, but use their own commentary, called Sariraka-bhasya, written by Sankaracarya.</p>
<p>The students of the Bhagavata school are engaged in devotional service of the Lord, according to pancaratriki regulations, and therefore the Vaisnava sannyasis have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Vaisnava sannyasis have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>But the Mayavadi sannyasis, engaged in the studies of sankhya and Vedanta and speculation, cannot relish transcendental service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired of Brahman speculation, and thus they take shelter of the Bhagavatam without proper understanding.</p>
<p>Consequently their study of the Srimad-Bhagavatam becomes troublesome.</p>
<p>Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for the Mayavadi sannyasis.</p>
<p>The Vaisnava sannyasis, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi sannyasis sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged in Krsna consciousness are better situated than the sannyasis engaged in simple Brahman speculation, although they too come to Krsna consciousness, after many births.</p>

<p>One who works in devotion, who is a pure soul, and who controls his mind and senses, is dear to everyone, and everyone is dear to him.</p>
<p>Though always working, such a man is never entangled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is on the path of liberation by Krsna consciousness is very dear to every living being, and every living being is dear to him.</p>
<p>This is due to his Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate from Krsna, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree.</p>
<p>He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body.</p>
<p>Because one who works in Krsna consciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone.</p>
<p>And, because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness.</p>
<p>Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled.</p>
<p>And, because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled.</p>
<p>Because his mind is always fixed on Krsna, there is no chance of his being deviated from Krsna.</p>
<p>Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He does not like to hear anything except topics relating to Krsna; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered to Krsna; and he does not wish to go anywhere if Krsna is not involved.</p>
<p>Therefore, his senses are controlled.</p>
<p>A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone.</p>
<p>One may ask, "Why then was Arjuna offensive (in battle) to others? Wasn't he in Krsna consciousness?" Arjuna was only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain.</p>
<p>So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>Only their dresses were changed by the order of Krsna, who was personally present.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders of Krsna in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person in the divine consciousness, although engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving about, sleeping, and breathing, always knows within himself that he actually does nothing at all.</p>
<p>Because while speaking, evacuating, receiving, opening or closing his eyes, he always knows that only the material senses are engaged with their objects and that he is aloof from them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness is pure in his existence, and consequently he has nothing to do with any work which depends upon five immediate and remote causes: the doer, the work, the situation, the endeavor and fortune.</p>
<p>This is because he is engaged in the loving transcendental service of Krsna.</p>
<p>Although he appears to be acting with his body and senses, he is always conscious of his actual position, which is spiritual engagement.</p>
<p>In material consciousness, the senses are engaged in sense gratification, but in Krsna consciousness the senses are engaged in the satisfaction of Krsna's senses.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Krsna conscious person is always free, even though he appears to be engaged in things of the senses.</p>
<p>Activities such as seeing, hearing, speaking, evacuating, etc., are actions of the senses meant for work.</p>
<p>A Krsna consciousness person is never affected by the actions of the senses.</p>
<p>He cannot perform any act except in the service of the Lord because he knows that he is the eternal servitor of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who performs his duty without attachment, surrendering the results unto the Supreme God, is not affected by sinful action, as the lotus leaf is untouched by water.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here brahmani means in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The material world is a sum total manifestation of the three modes of material nature, technically called the pradhana.</p>
<p>The Vedic hymns, sarvam etad brahma, tasmad etad brahma nama-rupam annam ca jayate, and, in the Bhagavad-gita, mama yonir mahad brahma, indicate that everything in the material world is the manifestation of Brahman; and, although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause.</p>
<p>In the Isopanisad it is said that everything is related to the Supreme Brahman or Krsna, and thus everything belongs to Him only.</p>
<p>One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs to Krsna, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful.</p>
<p>Even one's material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>It is beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet.</p>
<p>The Lord also says in the Gita: mayi sarvani karmani sannyasya: "Resign all works unto Me [Krsna]."</p>
<p>The conclusion is that a person without Krsna consciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person in Krsna consciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property of Krsna and should therefore be engaged in the service of Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The yogis, abandoning attachment, act with body, mind, intelligence, and even with the senses, only for the purpose of purification.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By acting in Krsna consciousness for the satisfaction of the senses of Krsna, any action, whether of the body, mind, intelligence or even of the senses, is purified of material contamination.</p>
<p>There are no material reactions resulting from the activities of a Krsna conscious person.</p>
<p>Therefore, purified activities, which are generally called sadacara, can be easily performed by acting in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Sri Rupa Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu describes this as follows:</p>
<p>iha yasya harer dasye karmana manasa gira nikhilasv apy avasthasu jivanmuktah sa ucyate</p>
<p>A person acting in Krsna consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Krsna) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities.</p>
<p>He has no false ego, nor does he believe that he is this material body, nor that he possesses the body.</p>
<p>He knows that he is not this body and that this body does not belong to him.</p>
<p>He himself belongs to Krsna, and the body too belongs to Krsna.</p>
<p>When he applies everything produced of the body, mind, intelligence, words, life, wealth, etc.--whatever he may have within his possession--to Krsna's service, he is at once dovetailed with Krsna.</p>
<p>He is one with Krsna and is devoid of the false ego that leads one to believe that he is the body, etc.</p>
<p>This is the perfect stage of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The steadily devoted soul attains unadulterated peace because he offers the result of all activities to Me; whereas a person who is not in union with the Divine, who is greedy for the fruits of his labor, becomes entangled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The difference between a person in Krsna consciousness and a person in bodily consciousness is that the former is attached to Krsna, whereas the latter is attached to the results of his activities.</p>
<p>The person who is attached to Krsna and works for Him only is certainly a liberated person, and he is not anxious for fruitive rewards.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavatam, the cause of anxiety over the result of an activity is explained as being due to one's functioning in the conception of duality, that is, without knowledge of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Krsna is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In Krsna consciousness, there is no duality.</p>
<p>All that exists is a product of Krsna's energy, and Krsna is all good.</p>
<p>Therefore, activities in Krsna consciousness are on the absolute plane; they are transcendental and have no material effect.</p>
<p>One is, therefore, filled with peace in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One who is, however, entangled in profit calculation for sense gratification cannot have that peace.</p>
<p>This is the secret of Krsna consciousness--realization that there is no existence besides Krsna is the platform of peace and fearlessness.</p>

<p>When the embodied living being controls his nature and mentally renounces all actions, he resides happily in the city of nine gates [the material body], neither working nor causing work to be done.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The embodied soul lives in the city of nine gates.</p>
<p>The activities of the body, or the figurative city of body, are conducted automatically by the particular modes of nature.</p>
<p>The soul, although subjecting himself to the conditions of the body, can be beyond those conditions, if he so desires.</p>
<p>Owing only to forgetfulness of his superior nature, he identifies with the material body, and therefore suffers.</p>
<p>By Krsna consciousness, he can revive his real position and thus come out of his embodiment.</p>
<p>Therefore, when one takes to Krsna consciousness, one at once becomes completely aloof from bodily activities.</p>
<p>In such a controlled life, in which his deliberations are changed, he lives happily within the city of nine gates.</p>
<p>The nine gates are described as follows:</p>
<p>nava-dvare pure dehi hamso lelayate bahih vasi sarvasya lokasya sthavarasya carasya ca.</p>
<p>"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is living within the body of a living entity, is the controller of all living entities all over the universe.</p>
<p>The body consists of nine gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, the anus and the genital.</p>
<p>The living entity in his conditioned stage identifies himself with the body, but when he identifies himself with the Lord within himself, he becomes just as free as the Lord, even while in the body." (Svet.3.18)</p>

<p>All this is enacted by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The living entity, as will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, is one in nature with the Supreme Lord, distinguished from matter, which is another nature--called inferior--of the Lord.</p>
<p>Somehow, the superior nature, the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial.</p>
<p>The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions.</p>
<p>Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body.</p>
<p>It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress.</p>
<p>As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well.</p>
<p>As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions.</p>
<p>He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence.</p>
<p>The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them.</p>
<p>His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendental Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone's sinful or pious activities.</p>
<p>Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Sanskrit word vibhuh means the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation.</p>
<p>He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities.</p>
<p>He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins.</p>
<p>A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power.</p>
<p>The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not.</p>
<p>The Lord is vibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity is anu, or atomic.</p>
<p>Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will.</p>
<p>Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord.</p>
<p>And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired.</p>
<p>Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life.</p>
<p>The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity as Paramatma, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it.</p>
<p>Desire is a subtle form of conditioning of the living entity.</p>
<p>The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes.</p>
<p>The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires.</p>
<p>The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independant living entities.</p>
<p>However, when one desires Krsna, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy.</p>
<p>The Vedic hymn therefore declares:</p>
<p>esa u hy eva sadhu karma karayati tam yamebhyo lokebhya unninisate esa u evasadhu karma karayati yamadho ninisate.</p>
<p>ajno jantur aniso 'yam atmanah sukha-duhkhayoh isvara-prerito gacchet svargam vasvabhram eva ca.</p>
<p>"The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so he may be elevated.</p>
<p>The Lord engages him in impious activities so he may go to hell.</p>
<p>The living entity is completely dependant in his distress and happiness.</p>
<p>By the will of the Supreme he can go to heaven or hell, as a cloud is driven by the air."</p>
<p>Therefore the embodied soul, by his immemorial desire to avoid Krsna consciousness, causes his own bewilderment.</p>
<p>Consequently, although he is constitutionally eternal, blissful and cognizant, due to the littleness of his existence he forgets his constitutional position of service to the Lord and is thus entrapped by nescience.</p>
<p>And, under the spell of ignorance, the living entity claims that the Lord is responsible for his conditional existence.</p>
<p>The Vedanta-sutras also confirm this:</p>
<p>vaisamya-nairghrnye na sapeksatvat tatha hi darsayati.</p>
<p>"The Lord neither hates nor likes anyone, though He appears to."</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When, however, one is enlightened with the knowledge by which nescience is destroyed, then his knowledge reveals everything, as the sun lights up everything in the daytime.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who have forgotten Krsna must certainly be bewildered, but those who are in Krsna consciousness are not bewildered at all.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, "sarvam jnana-plavena," "jnanagnih sarva-karmani" and "na hi jnanena sadrsam."</p>
<p>Knowledge is always highly esteemed.</p>
<p>And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders unto Krsna, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse: bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate.</p>
<p>After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders unto Krsna, or when one attains Krsna consciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as the sun reveals everything in the daytime.</p>
<p>The living entity is bewildered in so many ways.</p>
<p>For instance, when he thinks himself God, unceremoniously, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience.</p>
<p>If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God.</p>
<p>Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfect Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn what Krsna consciousness is.</p>
<p>The spiritual master can drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness.</p>
<p>Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul.</p>
<p>However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fide Krsna conscious spiritual master.</p>
<p>One can know God and one's relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God.</p>
<p>A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God.</p>
<p>One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna therefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual.</p>
<p>They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation.</p>
<p>At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity.</p>
<p>Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When one's intelligence, mind, faith and refuge are all fixed in the Supreme, then one becomes fully cleansed of misgivings through complete knowledge and thus proceeds straight on the path of liberation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Transcendental Truth is Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>The whole Bhagavad-gita centers around the declaration of Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That is the version of all Vedic literature.</p>
<p>Paratattva means the Supreme Reality, who is understood by the knowers of the Supreme as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.</p>
<p>Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the last word in the Absolute.</p>
<p>There is nothing more than that.TheLord says, mattah parataram nanyat kincit asti dhananjaya.</p>
<p>Impersonal Brahman is also supported by Krsna: brahmano pratisthaham.</p>
<p>Therefore in all ways Krsna is the Supreme Reality.</p>
<p>One whose mind, intelligence, faith and refuge are always in Krsna, or, in other words, one who is fully in Krsna consciousness, is undoubtedly washed clean of all misgivings and is in perfect knowledge in everything concerning transcendence.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person can thoroughly understand that there is duality (simultaneous identity and individuality) in Krsna, and, equipped with such transcendental knowledge, one can make steady progress on the path of liberation.</p>

<p>The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater [outcaste] .</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person does not make any distinction between species or castes.</p>
<p>The brahmana and the outcaste may be different from the social point of view, or a dog, a cow, or an elephant may be different from the point of view of species, but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist.</p>
<p>This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion as Paramatma, is present in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge.</p>
<p>As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself as Paramatma regardless of the circumstances of the living entities.</p>
<p>The Lord as Paramatma is present both in the outcaste and in the brahmana, although the body of a brahmana and that of an outcaste are not the same.</p>
<p>The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality.</p>
<p>The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body, whereas the Paramatma is present in each and every body.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision.</p>
<p>The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful.</p>
<p>But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body, whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies.</p>
<p>The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the self-realized person are given herein.</p>
<p>The first symptom is that he is not illusioned by the false identification of the body with his true self.</p>
<p>He knows perfectly well that he is not this body, but is the fragmental port~on of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is therefore not joyful in achieving something, nor does he lament in losing anything which is related to his body.</p>
<p>This steadiness of mind is called sthira-buddhi, or self-intelligence.</p>
<p>He is therefore never bewildered by mistaking the gross body for the soul, nor does he accept the body as permanent and disregard the existence of the soul.</p>
<p>This knowledge elevates him to the station of knowing the complete science of the Absolute Truth, namely Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.</p>
<p>He thus knows his constitutional position perfectly well, without falsely trying to become one with the Supreme in all respects.</p>
<p>This is called Brahman realization, or self-realization.</p>
<p>Such steady consciousness is called Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>Sri Yamunacarya, a great devotee in Krsna consciousness, said:</p>

<p>"Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste."</p>
<p>A person in brahma-yoga, or Krsna consciousness, is so absorbed in the loving service of the Lord that he loses his taste for material sense pleasure altogether.</p>
<p>The highest pleasure in terms of matter is sex pleasure.</p>
<p>The whole world is moving under its spell, and a materialist cannot work at all without this motivation.</p>
<p>But a person engaged in Krsna consciousness can work with greater vigor without sex pleasure, which he avoids.</p>
<p>That is the test in spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Spiritual realization and sex pleasure go ill together.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is not attracted to any kind of sense pleasure due to his being a liberated soul.</p>

<p>An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses.</p>
<p>O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material sense pleasures are due to the contact of the material senses, which are all temporary because the body itself is temporary.</p>
<p>A liberated soul is not interested in anything which is temporary.</p>
<p>Knowing well the joys of transcendental pleasures, how can a liberated soul agree to enjoy false pleasure? In the Padma Purana it is said:</p>
<p>ramante yogino 'nante satyananda-cid-atmani iti rama-padenasau param brahmabhidhiyate</p>
<p>"The mystics derive unlimited transcendental pleasures from the Absolute Truth, and therefore the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, is also known as Rama."</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam also it is said:</p>
<p>nayam deho deha-bhajam nr-loke kastan kaman arhate vid-bhajam ye tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam.</p>
<p>"My dear sons, there is no reason to labor very hard for sense pleasure while in this human form of life; such pleasures are available to the stool-eaters [hogs].</p>
<p>Rather, you should undergo penances in this life by which your existence will be purified, and, as a result, you will be able to enjoy unlimited transcendental bliss." (Bhag.5.5.1)</p>
<p>Therefore, those who are true yogis or learned transcendentalists are not attracted by sense pleasures, which are the causes of continuous material existence.</p>
<p>The more one is addicted to material pleasures, the more he is entrapped by material miseries.</p>

<p>Even great sages are not able to control the forces of the senses as effectively as those who are engaged in transcendental bliss by serving the lotus feet of the Lord, uprooting the deep grown desire for fruitive activities." (Bhag.4.22.39)</p>
<p>In the conditioned soul the desire to enjoy the fruitive results of work is so deep-rooted that it is very difficult even for the great sages to control such desires, despite great endeavors.</p>
<p>A devotee of the Lord, constantly engaged in devotional service in Krsna consciousness, perfect in self-realization, very quickly attains liberation in the Supreme.</p>
<p>Owing to his complete knowledge in self-realization, he always remains in trance.</p>
<p>To cite an analagous example of this:</p>
<p>darsana-dhyana-samsparsair matsya-kurma-vihangamah svanya patyani pusnanti tathaham api padmaja.</p>
<p>"By vision, by meditation and by touch only do the fish, the tortoise and the birds maintain their offspring.</p>
<p>Similarly do I also, O Padmaja!"</p>
<p>The fish brings up its offspring simply by looking at them.</p>
<p>The tortoise brings up its offspring simply by meditation.</p>
<p>The eggs of the tortoise are laid on land, and the tortoise meditates on the eggs while in the water.</p>
<p>Similarly, a devotee in Krsna consciousness, although far away from the Lord's abode, can elevate himself to that abode simply by thinking of Him constantly--by engagement in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>He does not feel the pangs of material miseries; this state of life is called brahma-nirvana, or the absence of material miseries due to being constantly immersed in the Supreme.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Shutting out all external sense objects, keeping the eyes and vision concentrated between the two eyebrows, suspending the inward and outward breaths within the nostrils--thus controlling the mind, senses and intelligence, the tranecendentalist becomes free from desire, fear and anger.</p>
<p>One who is always in this state is certainly liberated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Being engaged in Krsna consciousness, one can immediately understand one's spiritual identity, and then one can understand the Supreme Lord by means of devotional service.</p>
<p>When he is well situated in devotional service, one comes to the transcendental position, qualified to feel the presence of the Lord in the sphere of one's activity.</p>
<p>This particular position is called liberation in the Supreme.</p>
<p>After explaining the above principles of liberation in the Supreme, the Lord gives instruction to Arjuna as to how one can come to that position by the practice of mysticism or yoga, known as astanga-yoga, which is divisible into an eightfold procedure called yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi.</p>
<p>In the Sixth Chapter the subject of yoga is explicitly detailed, and at the end of the Fifth it is only preliminarily explained.</p>
<p>One has to drive out the sense objects such as sound, touch, form, taste and smell by the pratyahara (breathing) process in yoga, and then keep the vision of the eyes between the two eyebrows and concentrate on the tip of the nose with half closed lids.</p>
<p>There is no benefit in closing the eyes altogether, because then there is every chance of falling asleep.</p>
<p>Nor is there benefit in opening the eyes completely, because then there is the hazard of being attracted by sense objects.</p>
<p>The breathing movement is restrained within the nostrils by neutralizing the up- and down-moving air within the body.</p>
<p>By practice of such yoga one is able to gain control over the senses, refrain from outward sense objects, and thus prepare oneself for liberation in the Supreme.</p>
<p>This yoga process helps one become free from all kinds of fear and anger and thus feel the presence of the Supersoul in the transcendental situation.</p>
<p>In other words, Krsna consciousness is the easiest process of executing yoga principles.</p>
<p>This will be thoroughly explained in the next chapter.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person, however, being always engaged in devotional service, does not risk losing his senses to some other engagement.</p>
<p>This is a better way of controlling the senses than by the astanga-yoga.</p>

<p>The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The conditioned souls within the clutches of illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world.</p>
<p>But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord Krsna is the beneficiary in all human activities.</p>
<p>Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon.</p>
<p>No one is greater than He.</p>
<p>He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Siva and Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is described as tam isvaranam paramam mahesvaram.</p>
<p>Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature.</p>
<p>Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively.</p>
<p>This is the sense of Kssna consciousness: Lord Krsna is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates.</p>
<p>One can attain perfect peace only in complete Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>This Fifth Chapter is a practical explanation of Krsna consciousness, generally known as karma-yoga.</p>
<p>The question of mental speculation as to how karma-yoga can give liberation is answered herewith.</p>
<p>To work in Krsna consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge of the Lord as the predominator.</p>
<p>Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Direct Krsna consciousness is bhakti-yoga, and jnana-yoga is a path leading to bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of Krsna, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel.</p>
<p>He comes into contact with maya (illusion) due to the desire to lord it over maya, and that is the cause of his many sufferings.</p>
<p>As long as he is in contact with matter, he has to execute work in terms of material necessities.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while one is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world.</p>
<p>The more one is advanced, the more he is freed from the clutches of matter.</p>
<p>The Lord is not partial toward anyone.</p>
<p>Everything depends on one's practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger.</p>
<p>And, attaining Krsna consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage, or brahman-nirvana.</p>
<p>The eightfold yoga mysticism is automatically practiced in Krsna consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served.</p>
<p>There is gradual process of elevation in the practice of yama, niyama, asana, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana, pranayama, and samadhi.</p>
<p>But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being.</p>
<p>It is the highest perfection of life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the Lord explains that the process of the eightfold yoga system is a means to control the mind and the senses.</p>
<p>However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the age of Kali.</p>
<p>Although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process of karma-yoga, or acting in Krsna consciousness, is better.</p>
<p>Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended.</p>
<p>The criterion of perfection is to act in Krsna consciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work.</p>
<p>To act in Krsna consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme.</p>
<p>The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body.</p>
<p>The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole.</p>
<p>Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfect sannyasi, the perfect yogi.</p>
<p>The sannyasis sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties, and therefore they cease to perform agnihotra yajnas (fire sacrifices), but actually they are self-interested because their goal is becoming one with the impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>Such a desire is greater than any material desire, but it is not without self-interest.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mystic yogi who practices the yoga system with half-open eyes, ceasing all material activities, desires some satisfaction for his personal self.</p>
<p>But a person acting in Krsna consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole, without self-interest.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>His criterion of success is the satisfaction of Krsna, and thus he is the perfect sannyasi, or perfect yogi.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya, the highest perfectional symbol of renunciation, prays in this way:</p>
<p>na dhanam na janam na sundarim kavitam va jagadisa kamaye.</p>
<p>mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi.</p>
<p>"O Almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor to enjoy beautiful women.</p>
<p>Nor do I want any number of followers.</p>
<p>What I want only is the causeless mercy of Your devotional service in my life, birth after birth."</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the Supreme, for no one can become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Real sannyasa-yoga or bhakti means that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly.</p>
<p>The living entity has no separate independant identity.</p>
<p>He is the marginal energy of the Supreme.</p>
<p>When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he is Krsna conscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities.</p>
<p>This is practiced by the yogis who restrain the senses from material attachment.</p>
<p>But a person in Krsna consciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose of Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, a Krsna conscious person is simultaneously a sannyasi and a yogi.</p>
<p>The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in the jnana and yoga processes, is automatically served in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, then jnana and yoga are of no avail.</p>
<p>The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment.</p>
<p>He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme.</p>
<p>One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity.</p>
<p>All these purposes are perfectly served by the practice of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The process of linking oneself with the Supreme is called yoga, which may be compared to a ladder for attaining the topmost spiritual realization.</p>
<p>This ladder begins from the lowest material condition of the living entity and rises up to perfect self-realization in pure spiritual life.</p>
<p>According to various elevations, different parts of the ladder are known by different names.</p>
<p>But all in all, the complete ladder is called yoga and may be divided into three parts, namely jnana-yoga, dhyana-yoga and bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>The beginning of the ladder is called the yogaruruksa stage, and the highest rung is called yogarudha.</p>
<p>Concerning the eightfold yoga system, attempts in the beginning to enter into meditation through regulative principles of life and practice of different sitting postures (which are more or less bodily exercises) are considered fruitive material activities.</p>
<p>All such activities lead to achieving perfect mental equilibrium to control the senses.</p>
<p>When one is accomplished in the practice of meditation, he ceases all disturbing mental activities.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is, however, situated from the beginning on the platform of meditation because he always thinks of Krsna.</p>
<p>And, being constantly engaged in the service of Krsna, he is considered to have ceased all material activities.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When a person is fully engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, he is pleased in himself, and thus he is no longer engaged in sense gratification or in fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Otherwise, one must be engaged in sense gratification, since one cannot live without engagement.</p>
<p>Without Krsna consciousness, one must be always seeking self-centered or extended selfish activities.</p>
<p>But a Krsna conscious person can do everything for the satisfaction of Krsna and thereby be perfectly detached from sense gratification.</p>
<p>One who has no such realization must mechanically try to escape material desires before being elevated to the top rung of the yoga ladder.</p>

<p>A man must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself.</p>
<p>The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word atma denotes body, mind and soul--depending upon different circumstances.</p>
<p>In the yoga system, the mind and the conditioned soul are especially important.</p>
<p>Since the mind is the central point of yoga practice, atma refers here to the mind.</p>
<p>The purpose of the yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from attachment to sense objects.</p>
<p>It is stressed herein that the mind must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience.</p>
<p>In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses.</p>
<p>In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because of the mind's ego which desires to lord it over material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved.</p>
<p>One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects.</p>
<p>The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence.</p>
<p>The best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the mind in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The word hi is used for emphasizing this point, i.e., that one must do this.</p>
<p>It is also said:</p>
<p>mana eva manusyanam karanam bandha-moksayoh bandhaya visayasango muktyai nirvisayam manah.</p>
<p>"For man, mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation.</p>
<p>Mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage, and mind detached from the sense objects is the cause of liberation."</p>
<p>Therefore, the mind which is always engaged in Krsna consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his very mind will be the greatest enemy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of practicing eightfold yoga is to control the mind in order to make it a friend in discharging the human mission.</p>
<p>Unless the mind is controlled, the practice of yoga (for show) is simply a waste of time.</p>
<p>One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled.</p>
<p>The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior.</p>
<p>As long as one's mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc.</p>
<p>But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone as Paramatma.</p>
<p>Real yoga practice entails meeting the Paramatma within the heart and then following His dictation.</p>
<p>For one who takes to Krsna consciousness directly, perfect surrender to the dictation of the Lord follows automatically.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has attained tranquility.</p>
<p>To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor are all the same.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone's heart as Paramatma.</p>
<p>When the mind is misled by the external illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities.</p>
<p>Therefore, as soon as one's mind is controlled through one of the yoga systems, one is to be considered as having already reached the destination.</p>
<p>One has to abide by superior dictation.</p>
<p>When one's mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no other alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme.</p>
<p>The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it.</p>
<p>The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of the Paramatma or Supersoul.</p>
<p>Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in Krsna consciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc.</p>
<p>This state is practical samadhi, or absorption in the Supreme.</p>

<p>This Bhagavad-gita is the science of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>No one can become Krsna conscious simply by mundane scholarship.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme Self; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully control his mind.</p>
<p>He should be free from desires and feelings of possessiveness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna is realized in different degrees as Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness means, concisely, to be always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>But those who are attached to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Supersoul are also partially Krsna conscious, because impersonal Brahman is the spiritual ray of Krsna and Supersoul is the all-pervading partial expansion of Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus the impersonalist and the meditator are also indirectly Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>A directly Krsna conscious person is the topmost transcendentalist because such a devotee knows what is meant by Brahman or Paramatma.</p>
<p>His knowledge of the Absolute Truth is perfect, whereas the impersonalist and the meditative yogi are imperfectly Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, all of these are instructed herewith to be constantly engaged in their particular pursuits so that they may come to the highest perfection sooner or later.</p>
<p>The first business of a transcendentalist is to keep the mind always on Krsna.</p>
<p>One should always think of Krsna and not forget Him even for a moment.</p>
<p>Concentration of the mind on the Supreme is called samadhi or trance.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate the mind, one should always remain in seclusion and avoid disturbance by external objects.</p>
<p>He should be very careful to accept favorable and reject unfavorable conditions that affect his realization.</p>
<p>And, in perfect determination, he should not hanker after unnecessary material things that entangle him by feelings of possessiveness.</p>
<p>All these perfections and precautions are perfectly executed when one is directly in Krsna consciousness because direct Krsna consciousness means self-abnegation, wherein there is very little chance for material possessiveness.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami characterizes Krsna consciousness in this way:</p>
<p>anasaktasya visayan yatharham upayunjatah nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate prapancikataya buddhya hari-sambandhi-vastunah mumuksubhih parityago vairagyam phalgu kathyate. (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 2.255-256)</p>
<p>"When one is not attached to anything, but at the same time accepts everything in relation to Krsna, one is rightly situated above possessiveness.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one who rejects everything without knowledge of its relationship to Krsna is not as complete in his renunciation."</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person well knows that everything belongs to Krsna, and thus he is always free from feelings of personal possession.</p>
<p>As such, he has no hankering for anything on his own personal account.</p>
<p>He knows how to accept things in favor of Krsna consciousness and how to reject things unfavorable to Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>He is always aloof from material things because he is always transcendental, and he is always alone, having nothing to do with persons not in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore a person in Krsna consciousness is the perfect yogi.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kusa-grass on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth.</p>
<p>The seat should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred place.</p>
<p>The yogi should then sit on it very firmly and should practice yoga by controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on one point.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>"Sacred place" refers to places of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>In India the yogis, the transcendentalists or the devotees all leave home and reside in sacred places such as Prayag, Mathura, Vrndavana, Hrsikesa, and Hardwar and in solitude practice yoga where the sacred rivers like the Yamuna and the Ganges flow.</p>
<p>But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners.</p>
<p>The so-called yoga societies in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice of yoga.</p>
<p>One who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Brhan-Naradiya Purana it is said that in the Kali-yuga (the present yuga or age) when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam kalau nasty eva nasty eva nasty eva gatir anyatha.</p>
<p>"In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>

<p>To realize this Visnu-murti within the heart, one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life; therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place, remaining seated as mentioned above.</p>
<p>One cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and thus become a yogi.</p>
<p>One has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification, of which sex life is the chief.</p>
<p>In the rules of celibacy written by the great sage Yajnavalkya it is said:</p>
<p>karmana manasa vaca sarvavasthasu sarvada sarvatra maithuna-tyago brahmacaryam pracaksate.</p>
<p>"The vow of brahmacarya is meant to help one completely abstain from sex indulgence in work, words and mind--at all times, under all circumstances, and in all places."</p>
<p>No one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence.</p>
<p>Brahmacarya is taught, therefore, from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life.</p>
<p>Children at the age of five are sent to the guru-kula, or the place of the spiritual master, and the master trains the young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmacaris.</p>
<p>Without such practice, no one can make advancement in any yoga, whether it be dhyana, jnana or bhakti.</p>
<p>One who, however, follows the rules and regulations of married life, having sexual relationship only with his wife (and that also under regulation), is also called brahmacari.</p>
<p>Such a restrained householder brahmacari may be accepted in the bhakti school, but the jnana and dhyana schools do not admit even householder brahmacaris.</p>
<p>They require complete abstinence without compromise.</p>
<p>In the bhakti school, a householder brahmacari is allowed controlled sex life because the cult of bhakti-yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses sexual attraction, being engaged in the superior service of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavad-gita it is said:</p>
<p>visaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinah rasa-varjam raso 'py asya param drstva nivartate</p>
<p>Whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification, a devotee of the Lord automatically refrains because of superior taste.</p>
<p>Other than the devotee, no one has any information of that superior taste.</p>
<p>Vigatabhih.</p>
<p>One cannot be fearless unless one is fully in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>A conditioned soul is fearful due to his perverted memory, his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam says, bhayam dvitiyabhinivesatah syad isad apetasya viparyayo 'smrtih: Krsna consciousness is the only basis for fearlessness.</p>
<p>Therefore, perfect practice is possible for a person who is Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>And since the ultimate goal of yoga practice is to see the Lord within, a Krsna conscious person is already the best of all yogis.</p>
<p>The principles of the yoga system mentioned herein are different from those of the popular so-called yoga societies.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus practicing control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of Krsna] by cessation of material existence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The ultimate goal in practicing yoga is now clearly explained.</p>
<p>Yoga practice is not meant for attaining any kind of material facility; it is to enable the cessation of all material existence.</p>
<p>One who seeks an improvement in health or aspires after material perfection is no yogi according to Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Nor does cessation of material existence entail one's entering into "the void," which is only a myth.</p>
<p>There is no void anywhere within the creation of the Lord.</p>
<p>Rather, the cessation of material existence enables one to enter into the spiritual sky, the abode of the Lord.</p>
<p>The abode of the Lord is also clearly described in the Bhagavad-gita as that place where there is no need of sun, moon, nor electricity.</p>
<p>All the planets in the spiritual kingdom are self-illuminated like the sun in the material sky.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God is everywhere, but the spiritual sky and the planets thereof are called param dhama, or superior abodes.</p>
<p>A consummate yogi, who is perfect in understanding Lord Krsna, as is clearly stated herein (mat-cittah, mat-parah, mat-sthanam) by the Lord Himself, can attain real peace and can ultimately reach His supreme abode, the Krsna-loka known as Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is clearly stated (goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhutah) that the Lord, although residing always in His abode called Goloka, is the all-pervading Brahman and the localized Paramatma as well by dint of His superior spiritual energies.</p>
<p>No one can reach the spiritual sky or enter into the eternal abode (Vaikuntha Goloka Vrndavana) of the Lord without the proper understanding of Krsna and His plenary expansion Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore a person working in Krsna consciousness is the perfect yogi, because his mind is always absorbed in Krsna's activities.</p>
<p>Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh.</p>
<p>In the Vedas also we learn: tam eva viditvatimrtyum eti: "One can overcome the path of birth and death only by understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna."</p>
<p>In other words, perfection of the yoga system is the attainment of freedom from material existence and not some magical jugglery or gymnastic feats to befool innocent people.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yogis.</p>
<p>Too much eating means eating more than is required to keep the body and soul together.</p>
<p>There is no need for men to eat animals because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk.</p>
<p>Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered to Krsna will suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things.</p>
<p>Bhunjate te tv agham papa ye pacanty atma-karanat.</p>
<p>Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food to Krsna, eats only sin.</p>
<p>One who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfect yoga.</p>
<p>It is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, only the Krsna conscious person can attain perfection in yoga practice.</p>
<p>Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practice yoga.</p>
<p>The Krsna conscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures.</p>
<p>He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to perform yoga practice.</p>
<p>One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required.</p>
<p>One should not sleep more than six hours daily.</p>
<p>One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal.</p>
<p>Such a person cannot perform yoga.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Extravagance in the matter of eating, sleeping, defending and mating--which are demands of the body--can block advancement in the practice of yoga.</p>
<p>As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and accept prasadam, sanctified food.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna is offered, according to the Bhagavad-gita (Bg.9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc.</p>
<p>In this way, a person in Krsna consciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or which is not in the category of goodness.</p>
<p>As far as sleeping is concerned, a Krsna conscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties in Krsna consciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>His ideal in this respect is Srila Rupa Gosvami, who was always engaged in the service of Krsna and who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that.</p>
<p>Thakura Haridasa would not even accept prasadam nor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names.</p>
<p>As far as work is concerned, a Krsna conscious person does not do anything which is not connected with Krsna's interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification.</p>
<p>Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him.</p>

<p>When the yogi, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and becomes situated in Transcendence--devoid of all material desires--he is said to have attained yoga.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The activities of the yogi are distinguished from those of an ordinary person by his characteristic cessation from all kinds of material desires--of which sex is the chief.</p>
<p>A perfect yogi is so well disciplined in the activities of the mind that he can no longer be disturbed by any kind of material desire.</p>
<p>This perfectional stage can automatically be attained by persons in Krsna consciousness, as is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.4.18-20):</p>
<p>sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanavarnane karau harer mandira-marjanadisu srutim cakaracyuta-sat-kathodaye mukunda-lingalaya-darsane drsau tad-bhrtyagatra-sparse 'nga-sangamam ghranam ca tat-pada-saroja-saurabhe srimat tulasya rasanam tad-arpite padau hareh ksetra-padanusarpane siro hrsikesa-padabhivandane kamam ca dasye na tu kama-kamyaya yathottama-sloka-janasraya ratih</p>
<p>"King Ambarisa first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Krsna; then, one after another, he engaged his words in describing the transcendental qualities of the Lord, his hands in mopping the temple of the Lord, his ears in hearing of the activities of the Lord, his eyes in seeing the transcendental forms of the Lord, his body in touching the bodies of the devotees, his sense of smell in smelling the scents of the lotus flower offered to the Lord, his tongue in tasting the tulasi leaf offered at the lotus feet of the Lord, his legs in going to places of pilgrimage and the temple of the Lord, his head in offering obeisances unto the Lord and his desires in executing the mission of the Lord.</p>
<p>All these transcendental activities are quite befitting a pure devotee."</p>
<p>This transcendental stage may be inexpressible subjectively by the followers of the impersonalist path, but it becomes very easy and practical for a person in Krsna consciousness, as is apparent in the above description of the engagements of Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>Unless the mind is fixed on the lotus feet of the Lord by constant remembrance, such transcendental engagements are not practical.</p>
<p>In the devotional service of the Lord, therefore, these prescribed activities are called arcana, or engaging all the senses in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>The senses and the mind require engagements.</p>
<p>Simple abnegation is not practical.</p>
<p>Therefore, for people in general--especially those who are not in the renounced order of life--transcendental engagement of the senses and the mind as described above is the perfect process for transcendental achievement, which is called yukta in the Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The stage of perfection is called trance, or samadhi, when one's mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga.</p>
<p>This is characterized by one's ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self.</p>
<p>In that joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses.</p>
<p>Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain.</p>
<p>Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty.</p>
<p>This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By practice of yoga one becomes gradually detached from material concepts.</p>
<p>This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle.</p>
<p>And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or samadhi which means that the yogi realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself.</p>
<p>Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the Patanjali system.</p>
<p>Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patanjali system of yoga.</p>
<p>There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patanjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness.</p>
<p>The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure--realized through transcendental senses--is accepted.</p>
<p>And this is corroborated by the Patanjali Muni, the famous exponent of the yoga system.</p>
<p>The great sage declares in his Yoga-sutras: purusartha-sunyanam gunanam pratiprasavah kaivalyam svarupa-pratistha va citi-saktir iti.</p>
<p>This citi-sakti, or internal potency, is transcendental.</p>
<p>Purusartha means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme.</p>
<p>This "oneness with the Supreme" is called kaivalyam by the monist.</p>
<p>But according to Patanjali, this kaivalyam is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position.</p>
<p>In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called ceto-darpana-marjanam, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind.</p>
<p>This "clearance" is actually liberation, or bhava-mahadavagni-nirvapanam.</p>
<p>The theory of nirvana--also preliminary--corresponds with this principle.</p>
<p>In the Bhagavatam this is called svarupena vyavasthitih.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita also confirms this situation in this verse.</p>
<p>After nirvana, or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In the words of the Bhagavatam, svarupena vyavasthitih: this is the "real life of the living entity."</p>
<p>Maya, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection.</p>
<p>Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity.</p>
<p>Patanjali also accepts this by his words kaivalyam svarupa-pratistha va citi-saktir iti.</p>
<p>This citi-sakti or transcendental pleasure, is real life.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Vedanta-sutras as anandamayo 'bhyasat.</p>
<p>This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of yoga and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhaktiyoga will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>In the yoga system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of samadhi, called samprajnata-samadhi and asamprajnata-samadhi.</p>
<p>When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called samprajnata-samadhi.</p>
<p>In the asamprajnata-samadhi there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses.</p>
<p>When the yogi is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it.</p>
<p>Unless the yogi is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Today's so-called yoga practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory.</p>
<p>A yogi indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery.</p>
<p>Even those yogis who are attracted by the siddhis (perfections) in the process of yoga are not perfectly situated.</p>
<p>If the yogis are attracted by the by-products of yoga, then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse.</p>
<p>Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or siddhis should know that the aim of yoga is lost in that way.</p>
<p>The best practice of yoga in this age is Krsna consciousness, which is not baffling.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness.</p>
<p>There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing hatha-yoga, dhyana-yoga, and jnana-yoga, but there is no such problem in executing karma-yoga or bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating.</p>
<p>But a person who is in pure bhakti-yoga or in Krsna consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body.</p>
<p>Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>He is callous toward incidental occurrences--such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative--but he is always alert to execute his duties in Krsna consciousness or bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Accidents never deviate him from his duty.</p>
<p>As stated in the Bhagavad-gita, agamapayino 'nityas tams titiksasva bharata.</p>
<p>He endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties.</p>
<p>In this way he achieves the highest perfection in yoga practice.</p>

<p>One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination and faith.</p>
<p>One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of false ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The yoga practitioner should be determined and should patiently prosecute the practice without deviation.</p>
<p>One should be sure of success at the end and pursue this course with great perserverance, not becoming discouraged if there is any delay in the attainment of success.</p>
<p>Success is sure for the rigid practitioner.</p>
<p>Regarding bhakti-yoga, Rupa Gosvami says:</p>
<p>utsahan niscayad dhairyat tat tat karma-pravartanat sanga-tyagat satovrtteh sadbhir bhaktih prasidhyati</p>
<p>"The process of bhakti-yoga can be executed successfully with full-hearted enthusiasm, perseverance, and determination by following the prescribed duties in the association of devotees and by engaging completely in activities of goodness."</p>
<p>As for determination, one should follow the example of the sparrow who lost her eggs in the waves of the ocean.</p>
<p>A sparrow laid her eggs on the shore of the ocean, but the big ocean carried away the eggs on its waves.</p>
<p>The sparrow became very upset and asked the ocean to return her eggs.</p>
<p>The ocean did not even consider her appeal.</p>
<p>So the sparrow decided to dry up the ocean.</p>
<p>She began to pick out the water in her small beak, and everyone laughed at her for her impossible determination.</p>
<p>The news of her activity spread, and at last Garuda, the gigantic bird carrier of Lord Visnu, heard it.</p>
<p>He became compassionate toward his small sister bird, and so he came to see the sparrow.</p>
<p>Garuda was very pleased by the determination of the small sparrow, and he promised to help.</p>
<p>Thus Garuda at once asked the ocean to return her eggs lest he himself take up the work of the sparrow.</p>
<p>The ocean was frightened at this, and returned the eggs.</p>
<p>Thus the sparrow became happy by the grace of Garuda.</p>
<p>Similarly, the practice of yoga, especially bhakti-yoga in Krsna consciousness, may appear to be a very difficult job.</p>
<p>But if anyone follows the principles with great determination, the Lord will surely help, for God helps those who help themselves.</p>

<p>From whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of the Self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The nature of the mind is flickering and unsteady.</p>
<p>But a self-realized yogi has to control the mind; the mind should not control him.</p>
<p>One who controls the mind (and therefore the senses as well) is called gosvami, or svami, and one who is controlled by the mind is called godasa, or the servant of the senses.</p>
<p>A gosvami knows the standard of sense happiness.</p>
<p>In transcendental sense happiness, the senses are engaged in the service of Hrsikesa or the supreme owner of the senses--Krsna.</p>
<p>Serving Krsna with purified senses is called Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That is the way of bringing the senses under full control.</p>
<p>What is more, that is the highest perfection of yoga practice.</p>

<p>A Krsna conscious yogi is the perfect seer because he sees Krsna, the Supreme, situated in everyone's heart as Supersoul (Paramatma).</p>
<p>Isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese 'rjuna tisthati.</p>
<p>The Lord in His Paramatma feature is situated within both the heart of the dog and that of a brahmana.</p>
<p>The perfect yogi knows that the Lord is eternally transcendental and is not materially affected by His presence in either a dog or a brahmana.</p>
<p>That is the supreme neutrality of the Lord.</p>
<p>The individual soul is also situated in the individual heart, but he is not present in all hearts.</p>
<p>That is the distinction between the individual soul and the Supersoul.</p>
<p>One who is not factually in the practice of yoga cannot see so clearly.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person can see Krsna in the heart of both the believer and nonbeliever.</p>
<p>In the smrti this is confirmed as follows: atatatvac ca matrtvad atma hi paramo harih.</p>
<p>The Lord, being the source of all beings, is like the mother and the maintainer.</p>
<p>As the mother is neutral to all different kinds of children, the Supreme Father (or Mother) is also.</p>
<p>Consequently the Supersoul is always in every living being.</p>
<p>Outwardly, also, every living being is situated in the energy of the Lord.</p>
<p>As will be explained in the Seventh Chapter, the Lord has, primarily, two energies--the spiritual (or superior) and the material (or inferior).</p>
<p>The living entity, although part of the superior energy, is conditioned by the inferior energy; the living entity is always in the Lord's energy.</p>
<p>Every living entity is situated in Him in one way or another.</p>
<p>The yogi sees equally because he sees that all living entities, although in different situations according to the results of fruitive work, in all circumstances remain the servants of God.</p>
<p>While in the material energy, the living entity serves the material senses; and while in spiritual energy, he serves the Supreme Lord directly.</p>
<p>In either case the living entity is the servant of God.</p>
<p>This vision of equality is perfect in a person in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness certainly sees Lord Krsna everywhere, and he sees everything in Krsna.</p>
<p>Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of Krsna, knowing that everything is the manifestation of Krsna's energy.</p>
<p>Nothing can exist without Krsna, and Krsna is the Lord of everything--this is the basic principle of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is the development of love of Krsna--a position transcendental even to material liberation.</p>
<p>It is the stage beyond self-realization at which the devotee becomes one with Krsna in the sense that Krsna becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving Krsna.</p>
<p>An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists.</p>
<p>In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality.</p>
<p>Nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee.</p>
<p>To merge in Krsna is spiritual annihilation.</p>
<p>A devotee takes no such risk.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Brahma-samhita:</p>
<p>premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>"I worship the primeval Lord, Govinda, who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love.</p>
<p>He is seen in His eternal form of Syamasundara situated within the heart of the devotee." (Bs.5.38)</p>
<p>At this stage, Lord Krsna never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the case of a yogi who sees the Lord as Paramatma within the heart, the same applies.</p>
<p>Such a yogi turns into a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment with out seeing the Lord within himself.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A yogi who is practicing meditation on the Supersoul sees within himself the plenary portion of Krsna as Visnu--with four hands, holding conchshell, wheel, club and lotus flower.</p>
<p>The yogi should know that Visnu is not different from Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna in this form of Supersoul is situated in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is no difference between the innumerable Supersouls present in the innumerable hearts of living entities.</p>
<p>Nor is there a difference between a Krsna conscious person always engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna and a perfect yogi engaged in meditation on the Supersoul.</p>
<p>The yogi in Krsna consciousness--even though he may be engaged in various activities while in material existence--remains always situated in Krsna.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu of Srila Rupa Gosvami: nikhilesu avasthasu jivanmukta sa ucyate.</p>
<p>A devotee of the Lord, always acting in Krsna consciousness, is automatically liberated.</p>
<p>In the Narada-pancaratra this is confirmed in this way:</p>
<p>dik-kalady-anavacchinne krsne ceto vidhaya ca tanmayo bhavati ksipram jivo brahmani yojayet.</p>
<p>"By concentrating one's attention on the transcendental form of Krsna, who is all-pervading and beyond time and space, one becomes absorbed in thinking of Krsna and then attains the happy state of transcendental association with Him."</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is the highest stage of trance in yoga practice.</p>
<p>This very understanding that Krsna is present as Paramatma in everyone's heart makes the yogi faultless.</p>
<p>The Vedas confirm this inconceivable potency of the Lord as follows:</p>
<p>eko 'pi san bahudha yo 'vabhati aisvaryad rupam ekam ca suryavad bahudheyate.</p>
<p>"Visnu is one, and yet He is certainly all-pervading.</p>
<p>By His inconceivable potency, in spite of His one form, He is present everywhere.</p>

<p>He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, both in their happiness and distress, O Arjuna!</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is Krsna conscious is a perfect yogi; he is aware of everyone's happiness and distress by dint of his own personal experience.</p>
<p>The cause of the distress of a living entity is forgetfulness of his relationship with God.</p>
<p>And the cause of happiness is knowing Krsna to be the supreme enjoyer of all the activities of the human being.</p>
<p>Krsna is the proprietor of all lands and planets.</p>
<p>The perfect yogi is the sincerest friend of all living entities.</p>
<p>He knows that the living being who is conditioned by the modes of material nature is subjected to the threefold material miseries due to forgetfulness of his relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>Because one in Krsna consciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge of Krsna everywhere.</p>
<p>Since the perfect yogi tries to broadcast the importance of becoming Krsna conscious, he is the best philanthropist in the world, and he is the dearest servitor of the Lord.</p>
<p>Na tasmat kascid me priyakrt tamah.</p>
<p>In other words, a devotee of the Lord always looks to the welfare of all living entities, and in this way he is factually the friend of everyone.</p>
<p>He is the best yogi because he does not desire perfection in yoga for his personal benefit, but tries for others also.</p>
<p>He does not envy his fellow living entities.</p>
<p>Here is a contrast between a pure devotee of the Lord and a yogi interested only in his personal elevation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: O Madhusudana, the system of yoga which you have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The system of mysticism described by Lord Krsna to Arjuna beginning with the words sucau dese and ending with yogi paramah is here being rejected by Arjuna out of a feeling of inability.</p>
<p>It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practice yoga in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration.</p>
<p>People are not serious about self-realization even by simple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficult yoga system, which regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and detachment of the mind from material engagements.</p>
<p>As a practical man, Arjuna thought it was impossible to follow this system of yoga, even though he was favorably endowed in many ways.</p>
<p>He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Five thousand years ago, Arjuna had much better facilities then we do now, yet he refused to accept this system of yoga.</p>
<p>In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time.</p>
<p>Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal.</p>
<p>If this were so five thousand years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating this yoga system in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are certainly wasting their time.</p>
<p>They are completely in ignorance of the desired goal.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Krsna, and to subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The mind is so strong and obstinate that it sometimes overcomes the intelligence, although mind is supposed to be subservient to the intelligence.</p>
<p>For a man in the practical world who has to fight so many opposing elements, it is certainly very difficult to control the mind.</p>
<p>Artificially, one may establish a mental equilibrium toward both friend and enemy, but ultimately no worldly man can do so, for this is more difficult than controlling the raging wind.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literatures it is said:</p>
<p>atmanam rathinam viddhi sariram ratham eva ca buddhintu sarathim viddhi manah pragraham eva ca indriyani hayanahur visayams tesu gocaran atmendriya-mano-yukto bhoktety ahur manisinah.</p>
<p>"The individual is the passenger in the car of the material body, and intelligence is the driver.</p>
<p>Mind is the driving instrument, and the senses are the horses.</p>
<p>The self is thus the enjoyer or sufferer in the association of the mind and senses.</p>
<p>So it is understood by great thinkers."</p>
<p>Intelligence is supposed to direct the mind, but the mind is so strong and obstinate that it often overcomes even one's own intelligence.</p>
<p>Such a strong mind is supposed to be controlled by the practice of yoga, but such practice is never practical for a worldly person like Arjuna.</p>
<p>And what can we say of modern man? The simile used here is appropriate: one cannot capture the blowing wind.</p>
<p>And it is even more difficult to capture the turbulent mind.</p>
<p>The easiest way to control the mind, as suggested by Lord Caitanya, is chanting "Hare Krsna," the great mantra for deliverance, in all humility.</p>
<p>The method prescribed is sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh: one must engage one's mind fully in Krsna.</p>
<p>Only then will there remain no other engagements to agitate the mind.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and by detachment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed by Arjuna, is accepted by the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible.</p>
<p>What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe strict rules and regulations, such as placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc.</p>
<p>By the practice of Krsna consciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing about Krsna.</p>
<p>This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings.</p>
<p>The more one hears about Krsna, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away from Krsna.</p>
<p>By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learn vairagya.</p>
<p>Vairagya means detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit.</p>
<p>Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities of Krsna.</p>
<p>This is practical because by hearing about Krsna one becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>This attachment is called paresanubhuti spiritual satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats.</p>
<p>Similarly, by discharge of devotional service, one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives.</p>
<p>It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet.</p>
<p>Hearing of the transcendental activities of Lord Krsna is therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered to Krsna is the appropriate diet for the suffering patient.</p>
<p>This treatment is the process of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization.</p>
<p>Trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it.</p>
<p>Similarly, yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time.</p>
<p>Such a show of yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned.</p>
<p>Therefore, the mind must be controlled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Unless one is engaged in Krsna consciousness, he cannot steadily control the mind.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without separate endeavor, but a yoga practitioner cannot achieve success without becoming Krsna conscious.</p>

<p>Arjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not persevere, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge.</p>
<p>These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind.</p>
<p>Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of the eightfold system or by bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later.</p>
<p>This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance.</p>
<p>Out of these three methods, the path of bhakti-yoga is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization.</p>
<p>To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord Krsna to confirm His former statement.</p>
<p>One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite constant endeavor, one may fail for many reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, one may not be following the process.</p>
<p>To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on illusory energy.</p>
<p>Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements.</p>
<p>A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines.</p>
<p>This is called yogat calita-manasah: deviation from the transcendental path.</p>
<p>Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization.</p>

<p>Those who are materialists have no interest in Transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work.</p>
<p>When one takes to the path of Transcendence, one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness.</p>

<p>A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one.</p>
<p>But if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky.</p>
<p>The brahmanah pathi is the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord who is manifested as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna is the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme Person is a successful transcendentalist.</p>
<p>To reach this goal of life through Brahman and Paramatma realization takes many, many births: Bahunam janmanam ante.</p>
<p>Therefore the supermost of transcendental realization is bhakti-yoga or Krsna consciousness, the direct method.</p>

<p>This is my doubt O Krsna, and I ask You to dispel it completely.</p>
<p>But for Yourself, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna is the perfect knower of past, present and future.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord said that all living entities exist individually in the past, that they exist now in the present, and that they continue to retain individual identity in the future, even after liberation from the material entanglement.</p>
<p>So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity.</p>
<p>Now, Arjuna wants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist.</p>
<p>No one is equal to or above Krsna, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him.</p>
<p>Therefore the verdict of Krsna is the final and complete answer to all doubts because He knows past, present and future perfectly--but no one knows Him.</p>
<p>Krsna and Krsna conscious devotees alone can know what is what.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: Son of Prtha, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.17) Sri Narada Muni instructs Vyasadeva as follows:</p>
<p>tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer bhajann apakko 'tha patet tato yadi yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim ko vartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah</p>
<p>"If someone gives up all material prospects and takes complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no loss or degradation in any way.</p>
<p>On the other hand a nondevotee may fully engage in his occupational duties and yet not gain anything."</p>
<p>For material prospects, there are many activities both scriptural and customary.</p>
<p>A transcendentalist is supposed to give up all material activities for the sake of spiritual advancement in life, Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One may argue that by Krsna consciousness one may attain the highest perfection if it is completed, but if one does not attain such a perfectional stage, then he loses both materially and spiritually.</p>
<p>It is enjoined in the scriptures that one has to suffer the reaction of not executing prescribed duties; therefore one who fails to discharge transcendental activities properly becomes subjected to these reactions.</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam assures the unsuccessful transcendentalist that there need be no worries.</p>
<p>Even though he may be subjected to the reaction of not perfectly executing prescribed duties, he is still not a loser, because auspicious Krsna consciousness is never forgotten, and one so engaged will continue to be so even if he is lowborn in the next life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one who simply follows strictly the prescribed duties need not necessarily attain auspicious results if he is lacking in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The purport may be understood as follows: humanity may be divided into two sections, namely, the regulated and the nonregulated.</p>
<p>Those who are engaged simply in bestial sense gratifications without knowledge of their next life or spiritual salvation belong to the nonregulated section.</p>
<p>And those who follow the principles of prescribed duties in the scriptures are classified amongst the regulated section.</p>
<p>The nonregulated section, both civilized and noncivilized, educated and noneducated, strong and weak, are full of animal propensities.</p>
<p>Their activities are never auspicious because, enjoying the animal propensities of eating, sleeping, defending and mating, they perpetually remain in material existence, which is always miserable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who are regulated by scriptural injunctions and thus gradually rise to Krsna consciousness certainly progress in life.</p>
<p>Those who are then following the path of auspiciousness can be divided into three sections, namely, 1) the followers of scriptural rules and regulations who are enjoying material prosperity, 2) those who are trying to find out the ultimate liberation from material existence, and 3) those who are devotees in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Those who are following the rules and regulations of the scriptures for material happiness may be further divided into two classes: those who are fruitive workers and those who desire no fruit for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Those who are after fruitive results for sense gratification may be elevated to a higher standard of life--even to the higher planets; but still, because they are not free from material existence, they are not following the truly auspicious path.</p>
<p>The only auspicious activities are those which lead one to liberation.</p>
<p>Any activity which is not aimed at ultimate self-realization or liberation from the material bodily concept of life is not at all auspicious.</p>
<p>Activity in Krsna consciousness is the only auspicious activity, and anyone who voluntarily accepts all bodily discomforts for the sake of making progress on the path of Krsna consciousness can be called a perfect transcendentalist under severe austerity.</p>
<p>And because the eightfold yoga system is directed toward the ultimate realization of Krsna consciousness, such practice is also auspicious, and no one who is trying his best in this matter need fear degradation.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Advanced yogis are not very much attracted to the rituals of the scriptures, but they automatically become attracted to the yoga principles, which can elevate them to complete Krsna consciousness, the highest yoga perfection.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.33.8), such disregard of Vedic rituals by the advanced transcendentalists is explained as follows:</p>
<p>aho bata svapaco 'to gariyan yajjihvagre vartate nama tubhyam tepus tapas te juhuvuh sasnur arya brahmanucur nama grnanti ye te.</p>
<p>"O my Lord! Persons who chant the holy names of Your Lordship are far, far advanced in spiritual life, even if born in families of dog-eaters.</p>
<p>Such chanters have undoubtedly performed all kinds of austerities and sacrifices, bathed in all sacred places, and finished all scriptural studies."</p>
<p>The famous example of this was presented by Lord Caitanya, who accepted Thakur Haridasa as one of His most important disciples.</p>
<p>Although Thakur Haridasa happened to take his birth in a Moslem family, he was elevated to the post of namacarya by Lord Caitanya due to his rigidly attended principle of chanting three hundred thousand holy names of the Lord daily: Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>And because he chanted the holy name of the Lord constantly, it is understood that in his previous life he must have passed through all the ritualistic methods of the Vedas, known as sabda-brahman.</p>
<p>Unless, therefore, one is purified, one cannot take to the principle of Krsna consciousness nor become engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When we speak of yoga we refer to linking up our consciousness with the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Such a process is named differently by various practitioners in terms of the particular method adopted.</p>
<p>When the linking up process is predominantly in fruitive activities, it is called karma-yoga, when it is predominantly empirical, it is called jnana-yoga, and when it is predominantly in a devotional relationship with the Supreme Lord, it is called bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga or Krsna consciousness is the ultimate perfection of all yogas, as will be explained in the next verse.</p>
<p>The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority of yoga, but He has not mentioned that it is better than bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga is full spiritual knowledge, and as such, nothing can excel it.</p>
<p>Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect.</p>
<p>Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect.</p>
<p>And fruitive work without Krsna consciousness is a waste of time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most highly praised form of yoga performance mentioned here is bhakti-yoga, and this is still more clearly explained in the next verse.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>And of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word bhajete is significant here.</p>
<p>Bhajete has its root in the verb bhaj, which is used when there is need of service.</p>
<p>The English word "worship" cannot be used in the same sense as bhaja.</p>
<p>Worship means to adore, or to show respect and honor to the worthy one.</p>
<p>But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One can avoid worshiping a respectable man or a demigod and may be called discourteous, but one cannot avoid serving the Supreme Lord without being thoroughly condemned.</p>
<p>Every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus every living entity is intended to serve the Supreme Lord by his own constitution.</p>
<p>Failing to do this, he falls down.</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam confirms this as follows:</p>
<p>ya esam purusam saksad atma-prabhavam isvaram na bhajanty avajananti sthanad bhrasta patanty adhah.</p>
<p>"Anyone who does not render service and neglects his duty unto the Primeval Lord, who is the source of all living entities, will certainly fall down from his constitutional position."</p>
<p>In this verse also the word bhajanti is used.</p>
<p>Therefore, bhajanti is applicable to the Supreme Lord only, whereas the word "worship" can be applied to demigods or to any other common living entity.</p>
<p>The word avajananti, used in this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam, is also found in the Bhagavad-gita: avajananti mam mudhah: "Only the fools and rascals deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Krsna."</p>
<p>Such fools take it upon themselves to write commentaries on the Bhagavad-gita without an attitude of service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Consequently they cannot properly distinguish between the word bhajanti and the word "worship."</p>
<p>The culmination of all kinds of yoga practices lies in bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>All other yogas are but means to come to the point of bhakti in bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Yoga actually means bhakti-yoga; all other yogas are progressions toward the destination of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>From the beginning of karma-yoga to the end of bhakti-yoga is a long way to self-realization.</p>
<p>Karma-yoga, without fruitive results, is the beginning of this path.</p>
<p>When karma-yoga increases in knowledge and renunciation, the stage is called jnana-yoga.</p>
<p>When jnana-yoga increases in meditation on the Supersoul by different physical processes, and the mind is on Him, it is called astanga-yoga.</p>
<p>And, when one surpasses the astanga-yoga and comes to the point of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna, it is called bhakti-yoga, the culmination.</p>
<p>Factually, bhakti-yoga is the ultimate goal, but to analyze bhakti-yoga minutely one has to understand these other yogas.</p>
<p>The yogi who is progressive is therefore on the true path of eternal good fortune.</p>
<p>One who sticks to a particular point and does not make further progress is called by that particular name: karma-yogi, jnana-yogi or dhyana-yogi, raja-yogi, hatha-yogi, etc.</p>
<p>If one is fortunate enough to come to the point of bhakti-yoga, it is to be understood that he has surpassed all the other yogas.</p>
<p>Therefore, to become Krsna conscious is the highest stage of yoga, just as, when we speak of Himalayan, we refer to the world's highest mountains, of which the highest peak, Mount Everest, is considered to be the culmination.</p>
<p>It is by great fortune that one comes to Krsna consciousness on the path of bhakti-yoga to become well situated according to the Vedic direction.</p>
<p>The ideal yogi concentrates his attention on Krsna, who is called Syamasundara, who is as beautifully colored as a cloud, whose lotus-like face is as effulgent as the sun, whose dress is brilliant with jewels and whose body is flower garlanded.</p>
<p>Illuminating all sides is His gorgeous luster, which is called the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>He incarnates in different forms such as Rama, Nrsimha, Varaha and Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He descends like a human being, as the son of Mother Yasoda, and He is known as Krsna, Govinda and Vasudeva.</p>
<p>He is the perfect child, husband, friend and master, and He is full with all opulences and transcendental qualities.</p>
<p>If one remains fully conscious of these features of the Lord, he is called the highest yogi.</p>
<p>This stage of highest perfection in yoga can be attained only by bhakti-yoga, as is confirmed in all Vedic literature:</p>
<p>yasya deve para bhaktir yatha deve tatha gurau.</p>
<p>tasyaite kathita hy arthah prakasante mahatmanah.</p>
<p>"Only unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed."</p>
<p>Bhaktir asya bhajanam tadihamutropadhi nairasyenamusmin manah kalpanam; etad eva naiskarmyam.</p>
<p>"Bhakti means devotional service to the Lord which is free from desire for material profit, either in this life or in the next.</p>
<p>Devoid of such inclinations, one should fully absorb the mind in the Supreme.</p>
<p>That is the purpose of naiskarmya."</p>
<p>These are some of the means for performance of bhakti or Krsna consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of the yoga system.</p>

<p>Now hear, O son of Prtha [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, the nature of Krsna consciousness is fully described.</p>
<p>Krsna is full in all opulences, and how He manifests such opulences is described herein.</p>
<p>Also, four kinds of fortunate people who become attached to Krsna, and four kinds of unfortunate people who never take to Krsna are described in this chapter.</p>
<p>In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gita, the living entity has been described as nonmaterial spirit soul which is capable of elevating himself to self-realization by different types of yogas.</p>
<p>At the end of the Sixth Chapter, it has been clearly stated that the steady concentration of the mind upon Krsna, or in other words Krsna consciousness, is the highest form of all yoga.</p>
<p>By concentrating one's mind upon Krsna, one is able to know the Absolute Truth completely, but not otherwise.</p>
<p>Impersonal brahmajyoti or localized Paramatma realization is not perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth because it is partial.</p>
<p>Full and scientific knowledge is Krsna, and everything is revealed to the person in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In complete Krsna consciousness one knows that Krsna is ultimate knowledge beyond any doubts.</p>
<p>Different types of yoga are only steppingstones on the path of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One who takes directly to Krsna consciousness automatically knows about brahmajyoti and Paramatma in full.</p>
<p>By practice of Krsna consciousness yoga, one can know everything in full--namely the Absolute Truth, the living entities, the material nature, and their manifestations with paraphernalia.</p>
<p>One should therefore begin yoga practice as directed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.</p>
<p>Concentration of the mind upon Krsna the Supreme is made possible by prescribed devotional service in nine different forms, of which sravanam is the first and most important.</p>
<p>The Lord therefore says to Arjuna, "tat srnu," or "Hear from Me."</p>
<p>No one can be a greater authority than Krsna, and therefore by hearing from Him one receives the greatest opportunity for progress in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One has therefore to learn from Krsna directly or from a pure devotee of Krsna--and not from a nondevotee upstart, puffed up with academic education.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam this process of understanding Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, is described in the Second Chapter of the First Canto as follows:</p>
<p>srnvatam sva-katham krsnah punya-sravana-kirtanah hrdyantahstho hy abhadrani vidbunoti suhrt satam.</p>
<p>nasta-prayesv abhadresu nityam bhagavata-sevaya bhagavaty uttama-sloke bhaktir bhavati naisthiki.</p>
<p>tada rajas-tamo-bhavah kama-lobhadayas ca ye ceta etair anaviddham sthitam sattve prasidati.</p>
<p>evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogatah bhagavat-tattva-vijnanam mukta-sangasya jayate.</p>

<p>"To hear about Krsna from Vedic literatures, or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-gita, is itself righteous activity.</p>
<p>And for one who hears about Krsna, Lord Krsna, who is dwelling in everyone's heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him.</p>
<p>In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>As he hears more about Krsna from the Bhagavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>By development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished.</p>
<p>When these impurities are wiped away, the candidate remains steady in his position of pure goodness, becomes enlivened by devotional service and understands the science of God perfectly.</p>
<p>Thus bhakti-yoga severs the hard knot of material affection and enables one to come at once to the stage of 'asamsayam samagram,' understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead." (Bhag.1.2.17-21)</p>
<p>Therefore only by hearing from Krsna or from His devotee in Krsna consciousness can one understand the science of Krsna.</p>

<p>Complete knowledge includes knowledge of the phenomenal world and the spirit behind it.</p>
<p>The source of both of them is transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>The Lord wants to explain the above-mentioned system of knowledge because Arjuna is Krsna's confidential devotee and friend.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Fourth Chapter this explanation was given by the Lord, and it is again confirmed here: complete knowledge can be achieved only by the devotee of the Lord directly from the Lord in disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Therefore one should be intelligent enough to know the source of all knowledge, who is the cause of all causes and the only object for meditation in all types of yoga practices.</p>
<p>When the cause of all causes becomes known, then everything knowable becomes known, and nothing remains unknown.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>The first six chapters of the Gita are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by jnana-yoga, dhyana-yoga, and discrimination of the self from matter.</p>
<p>However, Krsna can only be known by persons who are in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramatma.</p>
<p>The yogis and jnanis are confused in their attempts to understand Krsna, although the greatest of the impersonalists, Sripada Sankaracarya, has admitted in his Gita commentary that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But his followers do not accept Krsna as such, for it is very difficult to know Krsna, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda.</p>
<p>Isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him.</p>
<p>Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti or devotional service is very easy, they cannot practice it.</p>
<p>If the path of bhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy.</p>
<p>The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami writes in his Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:</p>
<p>sruti-smrti-puranadi-pancaratra-vidhim vina aikantiki harer bhaktir utpatayaiva kalpate.</p>
<p>"Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, Puranas, Narada-pancaratra, etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society."</p>
<p>It is not possible for the Brahman realized impersonalist or the Paramatma realized yogi to understand Krsna the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yasoda or the charioteer of Arjuna.</p>
<p>Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about Krsna: "muhyanti yat surayah," "mam tu veda na kascana."</p>
<p>"No one knows Me as I am," the Lord says.</p>
<p>And if one does know Him, then "sa mahatma sudurlabhah."</p>
<p>"Such a great soul is very rare."</p>
<p>Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, he cannot know Krsna as He is (tattvatah), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher.</p>
<p>Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in Krsna, in the cause of all causes, in His omnipotence and opulence, and in His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation, because Krsna is benevolently inclined to His devotees.</p>
<p>He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said:</p>
<p>atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah</p>
<p>"No one can understand Krsna as He is by the blunt material senses.</p>
<p>But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him." (Padma Purana)</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego--altogether these eight comprise My separated material energies.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The science of God analyzes the constitutional position of God and His diverse energies.</p>
<p>Material nature is called prakrti, or the energy of the Lord in His different purusa incarnations (expansions) as described in the Svatvata Tantra:</p>
<p>visnos tu trini rupani purusakhyany atho viduh ekantu mahatah srastr dvitiyam tv anda-samsthitam trtiyam sarvabhuta-stham tani jnatva vimucyate</p>
<p>"For material creation, Lord Krsna's plenary expansion assumes three Visnus.</p>
<p>The first one, Maha-Visnu, creates the total material energy, known as mahat-tattva.</p>
<p>The second, Garbhodakasayi Visnu, enters into all the universes to create diversities in each of them.</p>
<p>The third, Ksirodakasayi Visnu, is diffused as the all-pervading Supersoul in all the universes and is known as Paramatma, who is present even within the atoms.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows these three Visnus can be liberated from material entanglement."</p>
<p>This material world is a temporary manifestation of one of the energies of the Lord.</p>
<p>All the activities of the material world are directed by these three Visnu expansions of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>These Purusas are called incarnations.</p>
<p>Generally one who does not know the science of God (Krsna) assumes that this material world is for the enjoyment of the living entities and that the living entities are the causes (Purusas), controllers and enjoyers of the material energy.</p>
<p>According to Bhagavad-gita this atheistic conclusion is false.</p>
<p>In the verse under discussion it is stated that Krsna is the original cause of the material manifestation.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam also confirms this.</p>
<p>The ingredients of the material manifestation are separated energies of the Lord.</p>
<p>Even the brahmajyoti, which is the ultimate goal of the impersonalists, is a spiritual energy manifested in the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>There are no spiritual diversities in brahmajyoti as there are in the Vaikunthalokas, and the impersonalist accepts this brahmajyoti as the ultimate eternal goal.</p>
<p>The Paramatma manifestation is also a temporary all-pervasive aspect of the Ksirodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>The Paramatma manifestation is not eternal in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Therefore the factual Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna.</p>
<p>He is the complete energetic person, and He possesses different separated and internal energies.</p>
<p>In the material energy, the principal manifestations are eight, as above mentioned.</p>
<p>Out of these, the first five manifestations, namely earth, water, fire, air and sky, are called the five gigantic creations or the gross creations, within which the five sense objects are included.</p>
<p>They are the manifestations of physical sound, touch, form, taste and smell.</p>
<p>Material science comprises these ten items and nothing more.</p>
<p>But the other three items, namely mind, intelligence and false ego, are neglected by the materialists.</p>
<p>Philosophers who deal with mental activities are also not perfect in knowledge because they do not know the ultimate source, Krsna.</p>
<p>The false ego--"I am," and "It is mine," which constitute the basic principle of material existence--includes ten sense organs for material activities.</p>
<p>Intelligence refers to the total material creation, called the mahat-tattva.</p>
<p>Therefore from the eight separated energies of the Lord are manifest the twenty-four elements of the material world, which are the subject matter of sankhya atheistic philosophy; they are originally offshoots from Krsna's energies and are separated from Him, but atheistic sankhya philosophers with a poor fund of knowledge do not know Krsna as the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>The subject matter for discussion in the sankhya philosophy is only the manifestation of the external energy of Krsna, as it is described in the Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which are all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here it is clearly mentioned that living entities belong to the superior nature (or energy) of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The inferior energy is matter manifested in different elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego.</p>
<p>Both forms of material nature, namely gross (earth, etc.) and subtle (mind, etc.), are products of the inferior energy.</p>
<p>The living entities, who are exploiting these inferior energies for different purposes, are the superior energy of the Supreme Lord, and it is due to this energy that the entire material world functions.</p>
<p>The cosmic manifestation has no power to act unless it is moved by the superior energy, the living entity.</p>
<p>Energies are always controlled by the energetic, and therefore living entities are always controlled by the Lord--they have no independant existence.</p>
<p>They are never equally powerful, as unintelligent men think.</p>
<p>The distinction between the living entities and the Lord is described in Srimad-Bhagavatam as follows (10.87.30):</p>
<p>aparimita dhruvas tanubhrto yadi sarva-gatas tarhim na sasyateti niyamo dhruva netaratha ajani ca yanmayam tad avimucya niyantr bhavet samam anujanatam yad-amatam mata-dustataya</p>
<p>"O Supreme Eternal! If the embodied living entities were eternal and all-pervading like You, then they would not be under Your control.</p>
<p>But if the living entities are accepted as minute energies of Your Lordship, then they are at once subject to Your supreme control.</p>
<p>Therefore real liberation entails surrender by the living entities to Your control, and that surrender will make them happy.</p>
<p>In that constitutional position only can they be controllers.</p>
<p>Therefore, men with limited knowledge who advocate the monistic theory that God and the living entities are equal in all respects are actually misleading themselves and others."</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Krsna is the only controller, and all living entities are controlled by Him.</p>
<p>These living entities are His superior energy because the quality of their existence is one and the same with the Supreme, but they are never equal to the Lord in quantity of power.</p>
<p>While exploiting the gross and subtle inferior energy (matter), the superior energy (the living entity) forgets his real spiritual mind and intelligence.</p>
<p>This forgetfulness is due to the influence of matter upon the living entity.</p>
<p>But when the living entity becomes free from the influence of the illusory material energy, he attains the stage called mukti, or liberation.</p>
<p>The false ego, under the influence of material illusion, thinks, "I am matter, and material acquisitions are mine."</p>
<p>His actual position is realized when he is liberated from all material ideas, including the conception of his becoming one in all respects with God.</p>
<p>Therefore one may conclude that the Gita confirms the living entity to be only one of the multi-energies of Krsna; and when this energy is freed from material contamination, it becomes fully Krsna conscious, or liberated.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit.</p>
<p>Spirit is the basic field of creation, and matter is created by spirit.</p>
<p>Spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development.</p>
<p>Rather, this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy.</p>
<p>This material body is developed because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because of that superior energy, spirit soul, being present.</p>
<p>Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul, Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore spirit and matter, which combine together to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything.</p>
<p>A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely, the living entity, may by manipulation of material energy construct a skyscraper, factory or city, but he cannot create matter out of nothing, and he certainly cannot construct a planet or a universe.</p>
<p>The cause of the universe is the Supersoul, Krsna, the supreme creator of all individual souls and the original cause of all causes, as the Katha Upanisad confirms: nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam.</p>

<p>O conquerer of wealth [Arjuna], there is no Truth superior to Me.</p>
<p>Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is a common controversy over whether the Supreme Absolute Truth is personal or impersonal.</p>
<p>As far as Bhagavad-gita is concerned, the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, and this is confirmed in every step.</p>
<p>In this verse, in particular, it is stressed that the Absolute Truth is a person.</p>
<p>That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of the Brahma-samhita: isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is Lord Krsna, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure, Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge.</p>
<p>These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the Svetasvatara Upanisad: tato yad uttarataram tad arupam anamayam ya etad vidur amrtas te bhavanti athetare duhkham evapi yanti.</p>
<p>"In the material world Brahma, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals.</p>
<p>But beyond Brahma there is the Transcendence who has no material form and is free from all material contaminations.</p>
<p>Anyone who can know Him also becomes transcendental, but those who do not know Him suffer the miseries of the material world."</p>
<p>The impersonalist puts more stress on the word arupam.</p>
<p>But this arupam is not impersonal.</p>
<p>It indicates the transcendental form of eternity, bliss and knowledge as described in the Brahma-samhita quoted above.</p>
<p>Other verses in the Svetasvatara Upanisad substantiate this as follows:</p>
<p>vedaham etam purusam mahantam aditya-varnam tamasah parastat tam eva vidvan amrta iha bhavati nanyah pantha vidyate ayanaya yasmat param naparam asti kincid yasmannaniyo na jyayo 'sti kincit</p>
<p>"I know that Supreme Personality of Godhead who is transcendental to all material conceptions of darkness.</p>
<p>Only he who knows Him can transcend the bonds of birth and death.</p>
<p>There is no way for liberation other than this knowledge of that Supreme Person.</p>
<p>"There is no truth superior to that Supreme Person because He is the supermost.</p>
<p>He is smaller than the smallest, and He is greater than the greatest.</p>
<p>He is situated as a silent tree, and He illumines the transcendental sky, and as a tree spreads its roots, He spreads His extensive energies."</p>
<p>From these verses one concludes that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is all-pervading by His multi-energies, both material and spiritual.</p>

<p>O son of Kunti [Arjuna], I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and the moon, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras; I am the sound in ether and ability in man.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally.</p>
<p>As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading, diffusive energies.</p>
<p>The taste of water is the active principle of water.</p>
<p>No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt.</p>
<p>Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord.</p>
<p>The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man's thirst.</p>
<p>That is the way of perceiving the Supreme.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism.</p>
<p>One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and abheda-tattvam--simultaneously one and different.</p>
<p>The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Similarly pranava or the omkara transcendental sound used in the beginning of every Vedic hymn to address the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him.</p>
<p>Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord Krsna by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omkara.</p>
<p>But they do not realize that omkara is the sound representation of Krsna.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of Krsna consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows Krsna consciousness is blessed.</p>
<p>Those who do not know Krsna are in illusion, and so knowledge of Krsna is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.</p>

<p>The uncontaminated flavor, the original flavor, which permeates everything, is Krsna.</p>
<p>Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals.</p>
<p>So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and some taste.</p>
<p>Vibhava means fire.</p>
<p>Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire is Krsna.</p>
<p>The heat in the fire is Krsna.</p>

<p>So even for digestion fire is needed.</p>

<p>In contact with material nature, the seed fructifies into various living entities, movable and inert.</p>
<p>Birds, beasts, men and many other living creatures are moving living entities; trees and plants, however, are inert--they cannot move, but only stand.</p>
<p>Every entity is contained within the scope of 8,400,000 species of life; some of them are moving and some of them are inert.</p>
<p>In all cases, however, the seed of their life is Krsna.</p>

<p>Krsna is Parabrahman, the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>Brahman is impersonal and Parabrahman is personal.</p>

<p>All material activities in the world are being conducted under the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Although these material modes of nature are emanations from the Supreme Lord, Krsna, He is not subject to them.</p>
<p>For instance, under the state laws one may be punished, but the king, the lawmaker, is not subject to that law.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the modes of material nature--goodness, passion and ignorance--are emanations from the Supreme Lord Krsna, but Krsna is not subject to material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore He is nirguna, which means that these gunas, or modes, although issuing from Him, do not affect Him.</p>
<p>That is one of the special characteristics of Bhagavan, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The whole world is enchanted by three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Those who are bewildered by these three modes cannot understand that transcendental to this material nature is the Supreme Lord, Krsna.</p>
<p>In this material world everyone is under the influence of these three gunas and is thus bewildered.</p>
<p>Bv nature living entities have particular types of body and particular types of psychic and biological activities accordingly.</p>
<p>There are four classes of men functioning in the three material modes of nature.</p>
<p>Those who are purely in the mode of goodness are called brahmanas.</p>
<p>Those who are purely in the mode of passion are called ksatriyas.</p>
<p>Those who are in the modes of both passion and ignorance are called vaisyas.</p>
<p>Those who are completely in ignorance are called sudras.</p>
<p>And those who are less than that are animals or animal life.</p>
<p>However, these designations are not permanent.</p>
<p>I may either be a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or whatever--in any case, this life is temporary.</p>
<p>But although life is temporary and we do not know what we are going to be in the next life, still, by the spell of this illusory energy, we consider ourselves in the light of this bodily conception of life, and we thus think that we are American, Indian, Russian or brahmana, Hindu, Muslim, etc.</p>
<p>And if we become entangled with the modes of material nature, then we forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is behind all these modes.</p>
<p>So Lord Krsna says that men, deluded by these three modes of nature, do not understand that behind the material background is the Supreme Godhead.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of living entities--human beings, demigods, animals, etc.--and each and every one of them is under the influence of material nature, and all of them have forgotten the transcendent Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, and even those who are in the mode of goodness, cannot go beyond the impersonal Brahman conception of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>They are bewildered before the Supreme Lord in His personal feature, which possesses all beauty, opulence, knowledge, strength, fame and renunciation.</p>
<p>When even those who are in goodness cannot understand, what hope is there for those in passion and ignorance? Krsna consciousness is transcendental to all these three modes of material nature, and those who are truly established in Krsna consciousness are actually liberated.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine.</p>
<p>Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy, their original superior power is covered.</p>
<p>Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence.</p>
<p>As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal.</p>
<p>The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul is therefore called nitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned.</p>
<p>No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history.</p>
<p>Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome.</p>
<p>Inferior material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will.</p>
<p>Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>The Vedas confirm this as follows:</p>
<p>mayam tu prakrtim vidyan mayinam tu mahesvaram.</p>
<p>"Although maya [illusion] is false or temporary, the background of maya is the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who is Mahesvara, the supreme controller."</p>
<p>Another meaning of guna is rope; it is to be understood that the conditioned soul is tightly tied by the ropes of illusion.</p>
<p>A man bound by the hands and feet cannot free himself--he must be helped by a person who is unbound.</p>
<p>Because the bound cannot help the bound, the rescuer must be liberated.</p>
<p>Therefore, only Lord Krsna, or His bona fide representative the spiritual master, can release the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>Without such superior help, one cannot be freed from the bondage of material nature.</p>
<p>Devotional service, or Krsna consciousness, can help one gain such release.</p>
<p>Krsna, being the Lord of illusory energy, can order this insurmountable energy to release the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>He orders this release out of His causeless mercy on the surrendered soul and out of His paternal affection for the living entity who is originally a beloved son of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord is the only means to get free from the clutches of the stringent material nature.</p>
<p>The words mam eva are also significant.</p>
<p>Mam means unto Krsna (Visnu) only, and not Brahma or Siva.</p>
<p>Although Brahma and Siva are greatly elevated and are almost on the level of Visnu, it is not possible for such incarnations of rajo-guna (passion) and tamo-guna (ignorance) to release the conditioned soul from the clutches of maya.</p>
<p>In other words, both Brahma and Siva are also under the influence of maya.</p>
<p>Only Visnu is the master of maya; therefore He can alone give release to the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>The Vedas confirm this in the phrase tvam eva viditva or "Freedom is possible only by understanding Krsna."</p>
<p>Even Lord Siva affirms that liberation can be achieved only by the mercy of Visnu.</p>
<p>Lord Siva says:</p>
<p>mukti-pradata sarvesam visnur eva na samsayah.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that Visnu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said in Bhagavad-gita that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality Krsna, one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature.</p>
<p>At this point a question arises: How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender to the lotus feet of Sri Krsna, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead? Mukti, or liberation from the laws of material nature, is sought by the leaders of mankind in different ways and with great plans and perseverance for a great many years and births.</p>
<p>But if that liberation is possible by simply surrendering unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then why don't these intelligent and hard-working leaders adopt this simple method?</p>
<p>The Gita answers this question very frankly.</p>
<p>Those really learned leaders of society like Brahma, Siva, Kapila, the Kumaras, Manu, Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahlada, Bali, and later on Madhvacarya, Ramanujacarya, Sri Caitanya and many others--who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, scientists, etc.--surrender to the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority.</p>
<p>Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>They have no idea of God; they simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material existence in their vain attempts to solve them.</p>
<p>Because material energy (nature) is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of "planning commissions."</p>
<p>The atheistic plan-makers are described herein by the word duskrtina, or "miscreants."</p>
<p>Krtina means one who has performed meritorious work.</p>
<p>The atheist planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also, because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute.</p>
<p>But because the atheist's brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called duskrtina, which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected.</p>
<p>In the Gita it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>It has no independant authority.</p>
<p>It works as the shadow moves, in accordance with the movements of the object.</p>
<p>But still material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works; nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hiranyakasipu and Ravana, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators.</p>
<p>These duskrtinas, or miscreants, are of four different patterns, as outlined below: (1) The mudhas are those who are grossly foolish, like hard-working beasts of burden.</p>
<p>They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves, and so do not want to part with them for the Supreme.</p>
<p>The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass.</p>
<p>This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master.</p>
<p>The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night.</p>
<p>He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by his master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party.</p>
<p>The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others.</p>
<p>This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work.</p>
<p>He does not know that karma (action) is meant for yajna (sacrifice).</p>
<p>Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being.</p>
<p>To such mudhas, material gains, which are destructible, are life's all in all--despite the fact that the mudhas enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor.</p>
<p>Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food; they are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters.</p>
<p>Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, nor do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources.</p>
<p>The swine who eat the soil do not care to accept sweetmeats made of sugar and ghee.</p>
<p>Similarly, the foolish worker will untiringly continue to hear of the sense-enjoyable tidings of the flickering mundane force that moves the material world. (2) Another class of duskrtina, or miscreant, is called the naradhama, or the lowest of mankind.</p>
<p>Nara means human being, and adhama means the lowest.</p>
<p>Out of the 8,400,000 different species of living beings, there are 400,000 human species.</p>
<p>Out of these there are numerous lower forms of human life that are mostly uncivilized.</p>
<p>The civilized human beings are those who have regulated principles of social, political and religious life.</p>
<p>Those who are socially and politically developed, but who have no religious principles, must be considered naradhamas.</p>
<p>Nor is religion without God religion, because the purpose of following religious principles is to know the Supreme Truth and man's relation with Him.</p>
<p>In the Gita the Personality of Godhead clearly states that there is no authority above Him and that He is the Supreme Truth.</p>
<p>The civilized form of human life is meant for man's reviving the lost consciousness of his eternal relation with the Supreme Truth, the Personality of Godhead Sri Krsna, who is all-powerful.</p>
<p>Whoever loses this chance is classified as a naradhama.</p>
<p>We get information from revealed scriptures that when the baby is in the mother's womb (an extremely uncomfortable situation) he prays to God for deliverance and promises to worship Him alone as soon as he gets out.</p>
<p>To pray to God when he is in difficulty is a natural instinct in every living being because he is eternally related with God.</p>
<p>But after his deliverance, the child forgets the difficulties of birth and forgets his deliverer also, being influenced by maya, the illusory energy.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the guardians of children to revive the divine consciousness dormant in them.</p>
<p>The ten processes of reformatory ceremonies, as enjoined in the Manu-smrti, which is the guide to religious principles, are meant for reviving God consciousness in the system of varnasrama.</p>
<p>However, no process is strictly followed now in any part of the world, and therefore 99.9 percent of the population is naradhama.</p>
<p>When the whole population becomes naradhama, naturally all their so-called education is made null and void by the all-powerful energy of physical nature.</p>
<p>According to the standard of the Gita, a learned man is he who sees on equal terms the learned brahmana, the dog, the cow, the elephant and the dog-eater.</p>
<p>That is the vision of a true devotee.</p>
<p>Sri Nityananda Prabhu, who is the incarnation of Godhead as divine master, delivered the typical naradhamas, the brothers Jagai and Madhai, and showed how the mercy of a real devotee is bestowed upon the lowest of mankind.</p>
<p>So the naradhama who is condemned by the Personality of Godhead can again revive his spiritual consciousness only by the mercy of a devotee.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in propagating the bhagavata-dharma or activities of the devotees, has recommended that people submissively hear the message of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The essence of this message is Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The lowest amongst human beings can be delivered by this submissive hearing process only, but unfortunately they even deny giving an aural reception to these messages, and what to speak of surrendering to the will of the Supreme Lord? Naradhamas, or the lowest of mankind, will fully neglect the prime duty of the human being. (3) The next class of duskrtina is called mayayapahrta-jnana, or those persons whose erudite knowledge has been nullified by the influence of illusory material energy.</p>
<p>They are mostly very learned fellows--great philosophers, poets, literati, scientists, etc.--but the illusory energy misguides them, and therefore they disobey the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>There are a great number of mayayapahrta-jnanas at the present moment, even amongst the scholars of the Gita.</p>
<p>In the Gita, in plain and simple language, it is stated that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>There is none equal to or greater than Him.</p>
<p>He is mentioned as the father of Brahma, the original father of all human beings.</p>
<p>In fact, Sri Krsna is said to be not only the father of Brahma but also the father of all species of life.</p>
<p>He is the root of the impersonal Brahman and Paramatma; the Supersoul in every entity is His plenary portion.</p>
<p>He is the fountainhead of everything, and everyone is advised to surrender unto His lotus feet.</p>
<p>Despite all these clear statements, the mayayapahrta-jnana deride the Personality of the Supreme Lord and consider Him merely another human being.</p>
<p>They do not know that the blessed form of human life is designed after the eternal and transcendental feature of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>All the unauthorized interpretations of the Gita by the class of mayayapahrta-jnana, outside the purview of the parampara system, are so many stumbling blocks in the path of spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>The deluded interpreters do not surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna, nor do they teach others to follow this principle. (4) The last class of duskrtina is called asuram bhavam asrita, or those of demonic principles.</p>
<p>This class is openly atheistic.</p>
<p>Some of them argue that the Supreme Lord can never descend upon this material world, but they are unable to give any tangible reasons as to why not.</p>
<p>There are others who make Him subordinate to the impersonal feature, although the opposite is declared in the Gita.</p>
<p>Envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the atheist will present a number of illicit incarnations manufactured in the factory of his brain.</p>
<p>Such persons whose very principle of life is to decry the Personality of Godhead cannot surrender unto the lotus feet of Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>Sri Yamunacarya Albandru of South India said, "O my Lord! You are unknowable to persons involved with atheistic principles despite Your uncommon qualities, features, and activities and despite Your personality being confirmed by all the revealed scriptures in the quality of goodness, and despite Your being acknowledged by the famous authorities renowned for their depth of knowledge in the transcendental science and situated in the godly qualities."</p>
<p>Therefore, (1) grossly foolish persons, (2) the lowest of mankind, (3) the deluded speculators, and (4) the professed atheists, as above mentioned, never surrender unto the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead in spite of all scriptural and authoritative advice.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O best among the Bharatas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me--the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Unlike the miscreants, these are adherents of the regulative principles of the scriptures, and they are called sukrtina, or those who obey the rules and regulations of scriptures, the moral and social laws, and are, more or less, devoted to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Out of these there are four classes of men--those who are sometimes distressed, those who are in need of money, those who are sometimes inquisitive, and those who are sometimes searching after knowledge of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>These persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service under different conditions.</p>
<p>These are not pure devotees because they have some aspiration to fulfill in exchange for devotional service.</p>
<p>Pure devotional service is without aspiration and without desire for material profit.</p>
<p>The Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu defines pure devotion thus:</p>
<p>anyabhilasitasunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam anukulyena krsnanusilanam bhaktir uttama.</p>
<p>"One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation.</p>
<p>That is called pure devotional service."</p>
<p>When these four kinds of persons come to the Supreme Lord for devotional service and are completely purified by the association of a pure devotee, they also become pure devotees.</p>
<p>As far as the miscreants are concerned, for them devotional service is very difficult because their lives are selfish, irregular and without spiritual goals.</p>
<p>But even some of them, by chance, when they come in contact with a pure devotee, also become pure devotees.</p>
<p>Those who are always busy with fruitive activities come to the Lord in material distress and at that time associate with pure devotees and become, in their distress, devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>Those who are simply frustrated also come sometimes to associate with the pure devotees and become inquisitive to know about God.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the dry philosophers are frustrated in every field of knowledge, they sometimes want to learn of God, and they come to the Supreme Lord to render devotional service and thus transcend knowledge of the impersonal Brahman and the localized Paramatma and come to the personal conception of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Lord or His pure devotee.</p>
<p>On the whole, when the distressed, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge, and those who are in need of money are free from all material desires, and when they fully understand that material remuneration has nothing to do with spiritual improvement, they become pure devotees.</p>
<p>As long as such a purified stage is not attained, devotees in transcendental service to the Lord are tainted with fruitive activities, and they search after mundane knowledge, etc.</p>
<p>So one has to transcend all this before one can come to the stage of pure devotional service.</p>

<p>Free from all contaminations of material desires, the distressed, the inquisitive, the penniless, and the seeker after supreme knowledge can all become pure devotees.</p>
<p>But out of them, he who is in knowledge of the Absolute Truth and free from all material desires becomes a really pure devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>And of the four orders, the devotee who is in full knowledge and is at the same time engaged in devotional service is, the Lord says, the best.</p>
<p>By searching after knowledge one realizes that his self is different from his material body, and when further advanced he comes to the knowledge of impersonal Brahman and Paramatma.</p>
<p>When one is fully purified, he realizes that his constitutional position is to be the eternal servant of God.</p>
<p>So by association with pure devotees, the inquisitive, the distressed, the seeker after material amelioration and the man in knowledge all become themselves pure.</p>
<p>But in the preparatory stage, the man who is in full knowledge of the Supreme Lord and is at the same time executing devotional service is very dear to the Lord.</p>
<p>He who is situated in pure knowledge of the transcendence of the Supreme Personality of God is so protected in devotional service that material contaminations cannot touch him.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is.</p>
<p>Such a great soul is very rare.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization.</p>
<p>In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service.</p>
<p>Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him.</p>
<p>At such a time one can understand that Lord Sri Krsna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not independant from Him.</p>
<p>He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus he thinks of everything in relation to Vasudeva, or Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>Such a universal vision of Vasudeva precipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna as the highest goal.</p>
<p>Such surrendered great souls are very rare.</p>
<p>This verse is very nicely explained in the Third Chapter of Svetasvatara Upanisad: "In this body there are powers of speaking, of seeing, of hearing, of mental activities, etc.</p>
<p>But these are not important if not related to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>And because Vasudeva is all-pervading and everything is Vasudeva, the devotee surrenders in full knowledge." (Bg.7.17 and 11.40)</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who are freed from all material contaminations surrender unto the Supreme Lord and engage in His devotional service.</p>
<p>As long as the material contamination is not completely washed off, they are by nature nondevotees.</p>
<p>But even those who have material desires and who resort to the Supreme Lord are not so much attracted by external nature; because of approaching the right goal, they soon become free from all material lust.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is recommended that whether one is free from all material desires, or is full of material desires, or desires liberation from material contamination, or is a pure devotee and has no desire for material sense gratification, he should in all cases surrender to Vasudeva and worship Him.</p>
<p>It is said in the Bhagavatam that less intelligent people who have lost their spiritual sense take shelter of demigods for immediate fulfillment of material desires.</p>
<p>Generally, such people do not go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, because they are in particular modes of nature (ignorance and passion) and therefore worship various demigods.</p>
<p>Following the rules and regulations of worship, they are satisfied.</p>
<p>The worshipers of demigods are motivated by small desires and do not know how to reach the supreme goal, but a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not misguided.</p>
<p>Because in Vedic literature there are recommendations for worshiping different gods for different purposes (e.g., a diseased man is recommended to worship the sun), those who are not devotees of the Lord think that for certain purposes demigods are better than the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>But a pure devotee knows that the Supreme Lord Krsna is the master of all.</p>
<p>In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that only the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is master and all others are servants.</p>
<p>Therefore a pure devotee never goes to demigods for satisfaction of his material needs.</p>
<p>He depends on the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>And the pure devotee is satisfied with whatever He gives.</p>

<p>I am in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.</p>
<p>As soon as one desires to worship the demigods, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to some particular deity.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>God has given independence to everyone; therefore, if a person desires to have material enjoyment and wants very sincerely to have such facilities from the material demigods, the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul in everyone's heart, understands and gives facilities to such persons.</p>
<p>As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires.</p>
<p>Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy.</p>
<p>The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence.</p>
<p>Therefore He gives everyone full independence--whatever one likes--but His ultimate instruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: man should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>That will make man happy.</p>
<p>Both the living entity and the demigods are subordinate to the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the living entity cannot worship the demigod by his own desire, nor can the demigod bestow any benediction without the supreme will.</p>
<p>As it is said, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Generally, persons who are distressed in the material world go to the demigods, as they are advised in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>A person wanting some particular thing may worship such and such a demigod.</p>
<p>For example, a diseased person is recommended to worship the sun-god; a person wanting education may worship the goddess of learning, Sarasvati; and a person wanting a beautiful wife may worship the goddess Uma, the wife of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>In this way there are recommendations in the sastras (Vedic scriptures) for different modes of worship of different demigods.</p>
<p>And because a particular living entity wants to enjoy a particular material facility, the Lord inspires him with a strong desire to achieve that benediction from that particular demigod, and so he successfully receives the benediction.</p>
<p>The particular mode of the devotional attitude of the living entity toward a particular type of demigod is also arranged by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The demigods cannot infuse the living entities with such an affinity, but because He is the Supreme Lord or the Supersoul who is present in the heart of all living entities, Krsna gives impetus to man to worship certain demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods are actually different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord; therefore they have no independence.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature (Taittiriya Upanisad, First Anuvaka) it is stated: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Supersoul is also present within the heart of the demigod; therefore He arranges through the demigod to fulfill the desire of the living entity.</p>
<p>But both the demigod and the living entity are dependant on the supreme will.</p>
<p>They are not independant."</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Endowed with such a faith, he seeks favors of a particular demigod and obtains his desires.</p>
<p>But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods cannot award benediction to the devotees without the permission of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The living entity may forget that everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget.</p>
<p>So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are not due to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement.</p>
<p>The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit.</p>
<p>But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust.</p>
<p>This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity, and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire.</p>
<p>In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires.</p>
<p>Devotional service of the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual.</p>
<p>For the living entity who desires to return to Godhead, material desires are impediments.</p>
<p>A pure devotee of the Lord is therefore not awarded the material benefits desired by less intelligent living entities who prefer to worship demigods of the material world rather than engage in devotional service of the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary.</p>
<p>Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Some commentators on the Gita say that one who worships a demigod can reach the Supreme Lord, but here it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to the different planetary systems where various demigods are situated, just as a worshiper of the sun achieves the sun or a worshiper of the demigod of the moon achieves the moon.</p>
<p>Similarly, if anyone wants to worship a demigod like Indra, he can attain that particular god's planet.</p>
<p>It is not that everyone, regardless of whatever demigod is worshiped, will reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That is denied here, for it is clearly stated that the worshipers of demigods go to different planets in the material world, but the devotee of the Supreme Lord goes directly to the supreme planet of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Here the point may be raised that if the demigods are different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord, then the same end should be achieved by worshiping them.</p>
<p>However, worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent because they don't know to what part of the body food must be supplied.</p>
<p>Some of them are so foolish that they claim that there are many parts and many ways to supply food.</p>
<p>This isn't very sanguine.</p>
<p>Can anyone supply food to the body through the ears or eyes? They do not know that these demigods are different parts of the universal body of the Supreme Lord, and in their ignorance they believe that each and every demigod is a separate God and a competitor of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Not only are demigods parts of the Supreme Lord, but ordinary living entities are also.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that the brahmanas are the head of the Supreme Lord, the ksatriyas are the arms, etc., and that all serve different functions.</p>
<p>Regardless of the situation, if one knows that both the demigods and himself are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his knowledge is perfect.</p>
<p>But if he does not understand this, he achieves different planets where the demigods reside.</p>
<p>This is not the same destination the devotee reaches.</p>
<p>The results achieved by the demigods' benedictions are perishable because within this material world the planets, the demigods and their worshipers are all perishable.</p>
<p>Therefore it is clearly stated in this verse that all results achieved by worshiping demigods are perishable, and therefore such worship is performed by the less intelligent living entity.</p>
<p>Because the pure devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness in devotional service of the Supreme Lord achieves eternal blissful existence that is full of knowledge, his achievements and those of the common worshiper of the demigods are different.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is unlimited; His favor is unlimited; His mercy is unlimited.</p>
<p>Therefore the mercy of the Supreme Lord upon His pure devotees is unlimited.</p>

<p>Unintelligent men, who know Me not, think that I have assumed this form and personality.</p>
<p>Due to their small knowledge, they do not know My higher nature, which is changeless and supreme.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who are worshipers of demigods have been described as less intelligent persons, and here the impersonalists are similarly described.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna in His personal form is here speaking before Arjuna, and still, due to ignorance, impersonalists argue that the Supreme Lord ultimately has no form.</p>
<p>Yamunacarya, a great devotee of the Lord in the disciplic succession from Ramanujacarya, has written two very appropriate verses in this connection.</p>
<p>He says, "My dear Lord, devotees like Vyasadeva and Narada know You to be the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>By understanding different Vedic literatures, one can come to know Your characteristics, Your form and Your activities, and one can thus understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But those who are in the modes of passion and ignorance, the demons, the nondevotees, cannot understand You.</p>
<p>They are unable to understand You.</p>
<p>However expert such nondevotees may be in discussing Vedanta and the Upanisads and other Vedic literatures, it is not possible for them to understand the Personality of Godhead."</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that the Personality of Godhead cannot be understood simply by study of the Vedanta literature.</p>
<p>Only by the mercy of the Supreme Lord can the Personality of the Supreme be known.</p>
<p>Therefore in this verse it is clearly stated that not only the worshipers of the demigods are less intelligent, but those nondevotees who are engaged in Vedanta and speculation on Vedic literature without any tinge of true Krsna consciousness are also less intelligent, and for them it is not possible to understand God's personal nature.</p>
<p>Persons who are under the impression that the Absolute Truth is impersonal are described as asuras, which means one who does not know the ultimate feature of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that supreme realization begins from the impersonal Brahman and then rises to the localized Supersoul--but the ultimate word in the Absolute Truth is the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Modern impersonalists are still less intelligent, for they do not even follow their great predecessor, Sankaracarya, who has specifically stated that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Impersonalists, therefore, not knowing the Supreme Truth, think Krsna to be only the son of Devaki and Vasudeva, or a prince, or a powerful living entity.</p>
<p>This is also condemned in Bhagavad-gita: "Only the fools regard Me as an ordinary person."</p>
<p>The fact is that no one can understand Krsna without rendering devotional service and without developing Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The Gita confirms this.</p>
<p>One cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or His form, quality or name simply by mental speculation or by discussing Vedic literature.</p>
<p>One must understand Him by devotional service.</p>
<p>When one is fully engaged in Krsna consciousness, beginning by chanting the mahamantra--Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare--then only can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Nondevotee impersonalists think that Krsna has a body made of this material nature and that all His activities, His form and everything, are maya.</p>
<p>These impersonalists are known as Mayavadi.</p>
<p>They do not know the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>The twentieth verse clearly states: "Those who are blinded by lusty desires surrender unto the different demigods."</p>
<p>It is accepted that besides the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are demigods who have their different planets (Bg.7.23), and the Lord also has a planet.</p>
<p>It is also stated that the worshipers of the demigods go to the different planets of the demigods, and those who are devotees of Lord Krsna go to the Krsnaloka planet.</p>
<p>Although this is clearly stated, the foolish impersonalists still maintain that the Lord is formless and that these forms are impositions.</p>
<p>From the study of the Gita does it appear that the demigods and their abodes are impersonal? Clearly, neither the demigods nor Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are impersonal.</p>
<p>They are all persons; Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He has His own planet, and the demigods have theirs.</p>
<p>Therefore the monistic contention that ultimate truth is formless and that form is imposed does not hold true.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated here that it is not imposed.</p>
<p>From the Gita we can clearly understand that the forms of the demigods and the form of the Supreme Lord are simultaneously existing and that Lord Krsna is sac-cid-ananda, eternal blissful knowledge.</p>
<p>The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Absolute Truth is anandamaya, or full of blissful pleasure, and that He is abhyasat, by nature the reservoir of unlimited auspicious qualities.</p>
<p>And in the Gita the Lord says that although He is aja (unborn), He still appears.</p>
<p>These are the facts that we should understand from the Gita.</p>
<p>We cannot understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be impersonal; the imposition theory of the impersonalist monist is false as far as the statements of the Gita are concerned.</p>
<p>It is clear herein that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Lord Krsna, has both form and personality.</p>

<p>I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent.</p>
<p>For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency [yoga-maya]; and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>lt may be argued that since Krsna was present on this earth and was visible to everyone, then why isn't He manifest to everyone now? But actually He was not manifest to everyone.</p>
<p>When Krsna was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In the assembly of Kurus, when Sisupala spoke against Krsna being elected president of the assembly, Bhisma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Pandavas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone.</p>
<p>He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common man.</p>
<p>Therefore in the Gita Krsna says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves.</p>
<p>He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure.</p>
<p>But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His eternal potency.</p>
<p>In the prayers of Kunti in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.8.18), it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of yoga-maya and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him.</p>
<p>Kunti prays: "O my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, I pray that You will also maintain me.</p>
<p>Your transcendental form is covered by the yoga-maya.</p>
<p>The brahmajyoti is the covering of the internal potency.</p>
<p>May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your sac-cid-ananda-vigraha, Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge."</p>
<p>This yoga-maya curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Gita.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the eternal potency of brahmajyoti and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account.</p>
<p>Also in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahma: "O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your eternal potency, and therefore no one can understand You.</p>
<p>Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them."</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, is not only unborn, but He is avyaya, inexhaustible.</p>
<p>His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible.</p>

<p>O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come.</p>
<p>I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the question of personality and impersonality is clearly stated.</p>
<p>If Krsna, the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered by the impersonalists to be maya, to be material, then He would, like the living entity, change His body and forget everything in His past life.</p>
<p>Anyone with a material body cannot remember his past life, nor can he foretell his future life, nor can he predict the outcome of his present life; therefore he cannot know what is happening in past, present and future.</p>
<p>Unless one is liberated from material contamination, he cannot know past, present and future.</p>
<p>Unlike the ordinary human being, Lord Krsna clearly says that He completely knows what happened in the past, what is happening in the present, and what will happen in the future.</p>
<p>In the Fourth Chapter we have seen that Lord Krsna remembers instructing Vivasvan, the sun-god, millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Krsna knows every living entity because He is situated in every living being's heart as the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>But despite His presence in every living entity as Supersoul and His presence beyond the material sky, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the less intelligent cannot realize Him as the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Certainly the transcendental body of Sri Krsna is not perishable.</p>
<p>He is just like the sun, and maya is like the cloud.</p>
<p>In the material world we can see that there is the sun and that there are clouds and different stars and planets.</p>
<p>The clouds may cover all these in the sky temporarily, but this covering is only apparent to our limited vision.</p>
<p>The sun, moon and stars are not actually covered.</p>
<p>Similarly, maya cannot cover the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>By His internal potency He is not manifest to the less intelligent class of men.</p>
<p>As it is stated in the third verse of this chapter, out of millions and millions of men, some try to become perfect in this human form of life, and out of thousands and thousands of such perfected men, hardly one can understand what Lord Krsna is.</p>
<p>Even if one is perfected by realization of impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma, he cannot possibly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, without being in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>This is their misfortune.</p>
<p>Such deluded persons, symptomatically, dwell in dualities of dishonor and honor, misery and happiness, woman and man, good and bad, pleasure and pain, etc., thinking, "This is my wife; this is my house; I am the master of this house; I am the husband of this wife."</p>

<p>For those who are sinful, atheistic, foolish and deceitful, it is very difficult to transcend the duality of desire and hate.</p>
<p>Only those who have passed their lives in practicing the regulative principles of religion, who have acted piously and have conquered sinful reactions can accept devotional service and gradually rise to the pure knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then, gradually, they can meditate in trance on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That is the process of being situated on the spiritual platform.</p>
<p>This elevation is possible in Krsna consciousness in the association of pure devotees who can deliver one from delusion.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam that if one actually wants to be liberated he must render service to the devotees; but one who associates with materialistic people is on the path leading to the darkest region of existence.</p>
<p>All the devotees of the Lord traverse this earth just to recover the conditioned souls from their delusion.</p>
<p>The impersonalists do not know that forgetting their constitutional position as subordinate to the Supreme Lord is the greatest violation of God's law.</p>
<p>Unless one is reinstated in his own constitutional position, it is not possible to understand the Supreme Personality or to be fully engaged in His transcendental loving service with determination.</p>

<p>Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old age and death take refuge in Me in devotional service.</p>
<p>They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental and fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Birth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the spiritual body.</p>
<p>There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service, is really liberated.</p>
<p>Aham brahmasmi: I am spirit.</p>
<p>It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman--spirit soul.</p>
<p>This Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this verse.</p>
<p>The pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything about transcendental and material activities.</p>
<p>Four kinds of impure devotees who engage themselves in the transcendental service of the Lord achieve their respective goals, and by the grace of the Supreme Lord, when they are fully Krsna conscious, they actually enjoy spiritual association with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>But those who are worshipers of demigods never reach the Supreme Lord in His supreme planet.</p>
<p>Even the less intelligent Brahman-realized persons cannot reach the supreme planet of Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Only persons who perform activities in Krsna consciousness (mam asritya) are actually entitled to be called Brahman, because they are actually endeavoring to reach the Krsna planet.</p>
<p>Such persons have no misgivings about Krsna, and thus they are factually Brahman.</p>
<p>Those who are engaged in worshiping the form or arca of the Lord or who are engaged in meditation on the Lord simply for liberation from material bondage, also know, by the grace of the Lord, the purports of Brahman, adhibhuta, etc., as explained by the Lord in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Those who know Me as the Supreme Lord, as the governing principle of the material manifestation, who know Me as the one underlying all the demigods and as the one sustaining all sacrifices, can, with steadfast mind, understand and know Me even at the time of death.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Persons acting in Krsna consciousness are never entirely deviated from the path of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In the transcendental association of Krsna consciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods.</p>
<p>Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and at the time of death such a Krsna conscious person can never forget Krsna.</p>
<p>Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>This Seventh Chapter particularly explains how one can become a fully Krsna conscious person.</p>
<p>The beginning of Krsna consciousness is association of persons who are Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Such association is spiritual and puts one directly in touch with the Supreme Lord, and, by His grace, one can understand Krsna to be the Supreme God.</p>
<p>At the same time one can really understand the constitutional position of the living entity and how the living entity forgets Krsna and becomes entangled in material activities.</p>
<p>By gradual development of Krsna consciousness in good association, the living entity can understand that due to forgetfulness of Krsna he has become conditioned by the laws of material nature.</p>
<p>He can also understand that this human form of life is an opportunity to regain Krsna consciousness and that it should be fully utilized to attain the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Many subjects have been discussed in this chapter: the man in distress, the inquisitive man, the man in want of material necessities, knowledge of Brahman, knowledge of Paramatma, liberation from birth, death and diseases, and worship of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>However, he who is actually elevated in Krsna consciousness does not care for the different processes.</p>
<p>He simply directly engages himself in activities of Krsna consciousness and thereby factually attains his constitutional position as eternal servitor of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>In such a situation he takes pleasure in hearing and glorifying the Supreme Lord in pure devotional service.</p>
<p>He is convinced that by doing so, all his objectives will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>This determined faith is called drdha-vrata, and it is the beginning of bhakti-yoga or transcendental loving service.</p>
<p>That is the verdict of all scriptures.</p>
<p>This Seventh Chapter of the Gita is the substance of that conviction.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna inquired: O my Lord, O Supreme Person, what is Brahman? What is the self? What are fruitive activities? What is this material manifestation? And what are the demigods? Please explain this to me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter Lord Krsna answers these different questions of Arjuna beginning with, "What is Brahman?" The Lord also explains karma, fruitive activities, devotional service and yoga principles, and devotional service in its pure form.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam explains that the Supreme Absolute Truth is known as Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan.</p>
<p>In addition, the living entity, individual soul, is also called Brahman.</p>
<p>Arjuna also inquires about atma, which refers to body, soul and mind.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic dictionary, atma refers to the mind, soul, body and senses also.</p>
<p>Arjuna has addressed the Supreme Lord as Purusottama, Supreme Person, which means that he was putting these questions not simply to a friend but to the Supreme Person, knowing Him to be the supreme authority able to give definitive answers.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>How does this Lord of sacrifice live in the body, and in which part does He live, O Madhusudana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord of sacrifice accepts Indra and Visnu.</p>
<p>Visnu is the chief of the primal demigods, including Brahma and Siva, and Indra is the chief of the administrative demigods.</p>
<p>Both Indra and Visnu are worshiped by yajna performances.</p>
<p>But here Arjuna asks who is actually the Lord of yajna (sacrifice), and how is the Lord residing within the body of the living entity.</p>
<p>Arjuna addresses the Lord as Madhusudana because Krsna once killed a demon named Madhu.</p>
<p>Actually these questions, which are of the nature of doubts, should not have arisen in the mind of Arjuna because Arjuna is a Krsna conscious devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore these doubts are like demons.</p>
<p>Since Krsna is so expert in killing demons, Arjuna here addresses Him as Madhusudana so that Krsna might kill the demonic doubts that arise in Arjuna's mind.</p>
<p>Now the word prayana-kale in this verse is very significant because whatever we do in life will be tested at the time of death.</p>
<p>Arjuna fears that at the time of death, those who are in Krsna consciousness will forget the Supreme Lord because at such a time body functions are disrupted and the mind may be in a panic-stricken state.</p>
<p>Therefore Maharaja Kulasekhara, a great devotee, prays, "My dear Lord, may I die immediately now that I'm healthy so that the swan of my mind may enter into the stem of Thy lotus feet."</p>
<p>This metaphor is used because the swan often takes pleasure in entering the stem of the lotus flower-similarly, the mind of the pure devotee is drawn to the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Maharaja Kulasekhara fears that at the moment of death his throat will be so choked up that he will not be able to chant the holy names, so it is better to "die immediately."</p>
<p>Arjuna questions how one's mind can remain fixed on Krsna's lotus feet at such times.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord said, The indestructible, transcendental living entity is called Brahman, and his eternal nature is called the self.</p>
<p>Action pertaining to the development of these material bodies is called karma, or fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brahman is indestructible and eternally existing, and its constitution is not changed at any time.</p>
<p>But beyond Brahman there is Parabrahman.</p>
<p>Brahman refers to the living entity, and Parabrahman refers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The constitutional position of the living entity is different from the position he takes in the material world.</p>
<p>In material consciousness, his nature is to try to be the lord of matter, but in spiritual (Krsna) consciousness, his position is to serve the Supreme.</p>
<p>When the living entity is in material consciousness, he has to take on various bodies in the material world.</p>
<p>That is called karma, or varied creation by the force of material consciousness.</p>
<p>In Vedic literature the living entity is called jivatma and Brahman, but he is never called Parabrahman.</p>
<p>The living entity (jivatma) takes different positions--sometimes he merges into the dark material nature and identifies himself with matter, and sometimes he identifies himself with the superior spiritual nature.</p>
<p>Therefore he is called the Supreme Lord's marginal energy.</p>
<p>According to his identification with material or spiritual nature, he receives a material or spiritual body.</p>
<p>In material nature he may take a body from any of the 8,400,000 species of life, but in spiritual nature he has only one body.</p>
<p>In material nature he is sometimes manifested as a man, demigod, an animal, a beast, bird, etc., according to his karma.</p>
<p>To attain material heavenly planets and enjoy their facilities, he sometimes performs sacrifices (yajna), but when his merit is exhausted, he returns to earth again in the form of a man.</p>
<p>In the process of sacrifice, the living entity makes specific sacrifices to attain specific heavenly planets and consequently reaches them.</p>
<p>When the merit of sacrifice is exhausted, then the living entity descends to earth in the form of rain, then takes on the form of grains, and the grains are eaten by man and transformed into semen, which impregnates a woman, and thus the living entity once again attains the human form to perform sacrifice and so repeat the same cycle.</p>
<p>In this way, the living entity perpetually comes and goes on the material path.</p>
<p>The Krsna conscious person, however, avoids such sacrifices.</p>
<p>He takes directly to Krsna consciousness and thereby prepares himself to return to Godhead.</p>
<p>Impersonalist commentators on the Gita unreasonably assume that Brahman takes the form of jiva in the material world, and to substantiate this they refer to Chapter Fifteen, verse 7, of the Gita.</p>
<p>But this verse also speaks of the living entity as "an eternal fragment of Myself."</p>
<p>The fragment of God, the living entity, may fall down into the material world, but the Supreme Lord (Acyuta) never falls down.</p>
<p>Therefore this assumption that the Supreme Brahman assumes the form of jiva is not acceptable.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that in Vedic literature Brahman (the living entity) is distinguished from Parabrahman (the Supreme Lord).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Physical nature is known to be endlessly mutable.</p>
<p>The universe is the cosmic form of the Supreme Lord, and I am that Lord represented as the Supersoul, dwelling in the heart of every embodied being.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The physical nature is constantly changing.</p>
<p>Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish.</p>
<p>This physical nature is called adhibhutam.</p>
<p>Because it is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point, the conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord that includes all the demigods and their different planets is called adhidaivatam.</p>
<p>The individual soul (jiva) accompanies the body.</p>
<p>The Supersoul, a plenary representation of Lord Krsna, is called the Paramatma or adhiyajna and is situated in the heart.</p>
<p>The word eva is particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that the Paramatma is not different from Him.</p>
<p>The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul's activities and is the source of consciousness.</p>
<p>The Supersoul gives the jiva an opportunity to act freely, and He witnesses his activities.</p>
<p>The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pure Krsna conscious devotee engaged in transcendental service of the Lord.</p>
<p>The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivatam is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul.</p>
<p>The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form whose legs are considered the lowet planets and whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper planetary system.</p>

<p>And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the importance of Krsna consciousness is stressed.</p>
<p>Anyone who quits his body in Krsna consciousness is at once transferred to the transcendental abode of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The word smaran (remembering) is important.</p>
<p>Remembrance of Krsna is not possible for the impure soul who has not practiced Krsna consciousness in devotional service.</p>
<p>To remember Krsna one should chant the mahamantra, Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare incessantly, following in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, being more tolerant than the tree, humbler than the grass and offering all respect to others without requiring respect in return.</p>
<p>In such a way one will be able to depart from the body successfully remembering Krsna and so attain the supreme goal.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The process of changing one's nature at the critical moment of death is here explained.</p>
<p>How can one die in the proper state of mind? Maharaja Bharata thought of a deer at the time of death and so was transferred to that form of life.</p>
<p>However, as a deer, Maharaja Bharata could remember his past activities.</p>
<p>Of course the cumulative effect of the thoughts and actions of one's life influences one's thoughts at the moment of death; therefore the actions of this life determine one's future state of being.</p>
<p>If one is transcendentally absorbed in Krsna's service,then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not physical.</p>
<p>Therefore the chanting of Hare Krsna is the best process for successfully changing one's state of being to transcendental life.</p>

<p>He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O Partha [Arjuna], is sure to reach Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse Lord Krsna stresses the importance of remembering Him.</p>
<p>One's memory of Krsna is revived by chanting the mahamantra, Hare Krsna.</p>
<p>By this practice of chanting and hearing the sound vibration of the Supreme Lord, one's ear, tongue and mind are engaged.</p>
<p>This mystic meditation is very easy to practice, and it helps one attain the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Purusam means enjoyer.</p>
<p>Although living entities belong to the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord, they are in material contamination.</p>
<p>They think themselves enjoyers, but they are not the supreme enjoyer.</p>
<p>Here it is clearly stated that the supreme enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different manifestations and plenary expansions as Narayana, Vasudeva, etc.</p>
<p>The devotees can constantly think of the object of worship, the Supreme Lord, in any of His features, Narayana, Krsna, Rama, etc., by chanting Hare Krsna.</p>
<p>This practice will purify him, and at the end of his life, due to his constant chanting, he will be transferred to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Yoga practice is meditation on the Supersoul within; similarly, by chanting Hare Krsna one fixes his mind always on the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The mind is fickle, and therefore it is necessary to engage the mind by force to think of Krsna.</p>
<p>One example often given is that of the caterpillar that thinks of becoming a butterfly and so is transformed into a butterfly in the same life.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we constantly think of Krsna, it is certain that at the end of our lives we shall have the same bodily constitution as Krsna.</p>

<p>One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person.</p>
<p>He is luminous like the sun and, being transcendental, is beyond this material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The process of thinking of the Supreme is mentioned in this verse.</p>
<p>The foremost point is that He is not impersonal or void.</p>
<p>One cannot meditate on something impersonal or void.</p>
<p>That is very difficult.</p>
<p>The process of thinking of Krsna, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein.</p>
<p>First of all, He is purusa, spiritual, Rama and Krsna, and is described herein as kavim; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything.</p>
<p>He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him.</p>
<p>He is also the supreme controller of the universe, maintainer and instructor of humanity.</p>
<p>He is smaller than the smallest.</p>
<p>The living entity is one 10,000th part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle.</p>
<p>Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest.</p>
<p>As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything.</p>
<p>By Him all these planetary systems are sustained.</p>
<p>We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air.</p>
<p>It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies.</p>
<p>The word acintya (inconceivable) is very significant in this connection.</p>
<p>God's energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya).</p>
<p>Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it.</p>
<p>We cannot even comprehend this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world--so how can we comprehend what is beyond? Acintya means that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable.</p>
<p>Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, Gita, and Srimad-Bhagavatam and follow the principles they set down.</p>
<p>This will lead one to understanding.</p>

<p>In this verse it is clearly stated that at the time of death the mind must be fixed in devotion on the Supreme Godhead.</p>
<p>For those practiced in yoga, it is recommended that they raise the life force between the eyebrows, but for a pure devotee who does not practice such yoga, the mind should always be engaged in Krsna consciousness so that at death he can remember the Supreme by His grace.</p>
<p>This is explained in verse fourteen.</p>
<p>The particular use of the word yoga-balena is significant in this verse because without practice of yoga one cannot come to this transcendental state of being at the time of death.</p>
<p>One cannot suddenly remember the Supreme Lord at death unless he is practiced in some yoga system, especially the system of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Since one's mind at death is very disturbed, one should practice transcendence through yoga during one's life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter omkara and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman.</p>
<p>Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy.</p>
<p>I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Krsna explains that Brahman, although one without a second, has different manifestations and features.</p>
<p>For the impersonalists, the syllable om is identical with Brahman.</p>
<p>Krsna here explains the impersonal Brahman in which the renounced order of sages enter.</p>
<p>In the Vedic system of knowledge, students, from the very beginning, are taught to vibrate om and learn of the ultimate impersonal Brahman by living with the spiritual master in complete celibacy.</p>
<p>In this way they realize two of Brahman's features.</p>
<p>This practice is very essential for the student's advancement in spiritual life, but at the moment such brahmacari (unmarried celibate) life is not at all possible.</p>
<p>The social construction of the world has changed so much that there is no possibility of one's practicing celibacy from the beginning of student life.</p>
<p>Throughout the world there are many institutions for different departments of knowledge, but there is no recognized institution where students can be educated in the brahmacari principles.</p>
<p>Unless one practices celibacy, advancement in spiritual life is very difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Caitanya has announced, according to the scriptural injunctions for this age of Kali, that no process of realizing the Supreme is possible except the chanting of the holy name of Lord Krsna: Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements.</p>
<p>Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To practice yoga, as suggested here, one first has to close the door of all sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>This practice is called pratyahara, or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects.</p>
<p>Sense organs for acquiring knowledge, such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch, should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification.</p>
<p>In this way the mind focuses on the Supersoul in the heart and the life force is raised to the top of the head.</p>
<p>In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail.</p>
<p>But as mentioned before, this practice is not practical in this age.</p>
<p>The best process is Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If one is always able to fix his mind on Krsna in devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or in samadhi.</p>

<p>It is clearly stated here that om, Brahman, and Lord Krsna are not different.</p>
<p>The impersonal sound of Krsna is om, but the sound Hare Krsna contains om.</p>
<p>It is clearly recommended in this age that if one quits his body at the end of this life chanting the mahamantra, Hare Krsna, he will reach the spiritual planets.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who are devotees of Krsna enter the Krsna planet or Goloka Vrndavana, whereas the impersonalists remain in the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>The personalists also enter many innumerable planets in the spiritual sky known as Vaikunthas.</p>

<p>For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Prtha, because of his constant engagement in devotional service.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>ln this verse the bhakti-yoga of the unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Godhead is described.</p>
<p>The preceeding verses mention four different kinds of devotees--the distressed, the inquisitive, those who seek material gain, and the speculative philosophers.</p>
<p>Different processes of liberation from material entanglement have also been described: karma-yoga, jnana-yoga, and hatha-yoga.</p>
<p>But here bhakti-yoga, without any mixture of these, is mentioned.</p>
<p>In bhakti-yoga the devotees desire nothing but Krsna.</p>
<p>The pure bhakti devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek salvation or liberation from material entanglement.</p>
<p>A pure devotee does not desire anything.</p>
<p>In the Caitanya-caritamrta the pure devotee is called niskama, which means he has no desire for self-interest.</p>
<p>Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain.</p>
<p>The pure devotee only wants to please the Supreme Lord, and so the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain.</p>
<p>The devotee can render service to any of the transcendental forms of the Supreme Lord, and he meets with none of the problems that plague the practitioners of other yogas.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga is very simple and pure and easy to perform.</p>
<p>One can begin by simply chanting Hare Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna is very merciful to those who engage in His service, and He helps in various ways that devotee who is fully surrendered to Him so he can understand Him as He is.</p>
<p>The Lord gives such a devotee sufficient intelligence so that ultimately the devotee can attain Him in His spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>The special qualification of the pure devotee is that he is always thinking of Krsna without considering the time or place.</p>
<p>There should be no impediments.</p>
<p>He should be able to carry out his service anywhere and at any time.</p>
<p>Some say that the devotee should remain in holy places like Vrndavana or some holy town where the Lord lived, but a pure devotee can live anywhere and create the atmosphere of Vrndavana by his devotional service.</p>
<p>It was Sri Advaita who told Lord Caitanya, "Wherever You are, O Lord--there is Vrndavana."</p>
<p>A pure devotee constantly remembers Krsna and meditates upon Him.</p>
<p>These are qualifications of the pure devotee for whom the Lord is most easily attainable.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga is the system that the Gita recommends above all others.</p>
<p>Generally, the bhakti-yogis are engaged in five different ways: 1) santa-bhakta, engaged in devotional service in neutrality; 2) dasya-bhakta, engaged in devotional service as servant; 3) sakhya-bhakta, engaged as friend; 4) vatsalya-bhakta, engaged as parent; and 5) madhurya-bhakta, engaged as conjugal lover of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In any of these ways, the pure devotee is always constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord and cannot forget the Supreme Lord, and so for him the Lord is easily attained.</p>
<p>A pure devotee cannot forget the Supreme Lord for a moment, and similarly, the Supreme Lord cannot forget His pure devotee for a moment.</p>
<p>This is the great blessing of the Krsna conscious process of chanting the mahamantra, Hare Krsna.</p>

<p>After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since this temporary material world is full of the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death, naturally he who achieves the highest perfection and attains the supreme planet, Krsnaloka, Goloka Vrndavana, does not wish to return.</p>
<p>The supreme planet is described in Vedic literature as beyond our material vision, and it is considered the highest goal.</p>
<p>The mahatmas (great souls) receive transcendental messages from the realized devotees and thus gradually develop devotional service in Krsna consciousness and become so absorbed in transcendental service that they no longer desire elevation to any of the material planets, nor do they even want to be transferred to any spiritual planet.</p>
<p>They only want Krsna's association and nothing else.</p>
<p>Such great souls in Krsna consciousness attain the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>In other words, they are the supreme souls.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All kinds of yogis--karma, jnana, hatha, etc.--eventually have to attain devotional perfection in bhakti-yoga, or Krsna consciousness, before they can go to Krsna's transcendental abode and never return.</p>
<p>Those who attain the highest material planets or the planets of the demigods are again subjected to repeated birth and death.</p>
<p>As persons on earth are elevated to higher planets, people in higher planets such as Brahmaloka, Candraloka and Indraloka fall down to earth.</p>
<p>The practice of sacrifice called pancagni-vidya, recommended in the Katha Upanisad, enables one to achieve Brahmaloka, but if, in Brahmaloka, one does not cultivate Krsna consciousness, then he must return to earth.</p>
<p>Those who progress in Krsna consciousness in the higher planets are gradually elevated to higher and higher planets and at the time of universal devastation are transferred to the eternal spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>When there is devastation of this material universe, Brahma and his devotees, who are constantly engaged in Krsna consciousness, are all transferred to the spiritual universe and to specific spiritual planets according to their desires.</p>

<p>By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahma's one day.</p>
<p>And such also is the duration of his night.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The duration of the material universe is limited.</p>
<p>It is manifested in cycles of kalpas.</p>
<p>A kalpa is a day of Brahma, and one day of Brahma consists of a thousand cycles of four yugas or ages: Satya, Treta, Dvapara, and Kali.</p>
<p>The cycle of Satya is characterized by virtue, wisdom and religion, there being practically no ignorance and vice, and the yuga lasts 1,728,000 years.</p>
<p>In the Treta-yuga vice is introduced, and this yuga lasts 1,296,000 years.</p>
<p>In the Dvapara-yuga there is an even greater decline in virtue and religion, vice increasing, and this yuga lasts 864,000 years.</p>
<p>And finally in Kali-yuga (the yuga we have now been experiencing over the past 5,000 years) there is an abundance of strife, ignorance, irreligion and vice, true virtue being practically nonexistent, and this yuga lasts 432,000 years.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga vice increases to such a point that at the termination of the yuga the Supreme Lord Himself appears as the Kalki avatara, vanquishes the demons, saves His devotees, and commences another Satya-yuga.</p>
<p>Then the process is set rolling again.</p>
<p>These four yugas, rotating a thousand times, comprise one day of Brahma, the creator god, and the same number comprise one night.</p>
<p>Brahma lives one hundred of such "years" and then dies.</p>
<p>These "hundred years" by earth calculations total to 311 trillion and 40 million earth years.</p>
<p>By these calculations the life of Brahma seems fantastic and interminable, but from the viewpoint of eternity it is as brief as a lightning flash.</p>
<p>In the causal ocean there are innumerable Brahmas rising and disappearing like bubbles in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Brahma and his creation are all part of the material universe, and therefore they are in constant flux.</p>
<p>In the material universe not even Brahma is free from the process of birth, old age, disease and death.</p>
<p>Brahma, however, is directly engaged in the service of the Supreme Lord in the management of this universe--therefore he at once attains liberation.</p>
<p>Elevated sannyasis are promoted to Brahma's particular planet, Brahmaloka, which is the highest planet in the material universe and which survives all the heavenly planets in the upper strata of the planetary system, but in due course Brahma and all inhabitants of Brahmaloka are subject to death, according to the law of material nature.</p>

<p>When one goes there, he never comes back.</p>
<p>That is My supreme abode.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is described in the Brahma-samhita as cintamani-dhama, a place where all desires are fulfilled.</p>
<p>The supreme abode of Lord Krsna known as Goloka Vrndavana is full of palaces made of touchstone.</p>
<p>There are also trees which are called "desire trees" that supply any type of eatable upon demand, and there are cows known as surabhi cows which supply a limitless supply of milk.</p>
<p>In this abode, the Lord is served by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune (Laksmis), and He is called Govinda, the primal Lord and the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>The Lord is accustomed to blow His flute (venum kvanantam).</p>
<p>His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds--His eyes are like the lotus petals and the color of His body like clouds.</p>
<p>He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of cupids.</p>
<p>He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair.</p>
<p>In the Gita Lord Krsna gives only a small hint of His personal abode (Goloka Vrndavana) which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>A vivid description is given in the Brahma-samhita.</p>
<p>Vedic literature states that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination.</p>
<p>When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world.</p>
<p>Krsna's supreme abode and Krsna Himself are nondifferent, being of the same quality.</p>
<p>On this earth, Vrndavana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supreme Goloka Vrndavana located in the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>When Krsna descended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known as Vrndavana in the district of Mathura, India.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is here clearly stated that the supreme destination from which there is no return is the abode of Krsna, the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>The Brahma-samhita describes this supreme abode as ananda-cinmaya-rasa, a place where everything is full of spiritual bliss.</p>
<p>Whatever variegatedness is manifest there is all of the quality of spiritual bliss--there is nothing material.</p>
<p>All variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven.</p>
<p>As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy.</p>
<p>So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere--both in the material and in the spiritual universes.</p>
<p>Yasyantahsthani means that everything is sustained by Him, whether it be spiritual or material energy.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated here that only by bhakti, or devotional service, can one enter into the Vaikuntha (spiritual) planetary system.</p>
<p>In all the Vaikunthas there is only one Supreme Godhead, Krsna, who has expanded Himself into millions and millions of plenary expansions.</p>
<p>These plenary expansions are four-armed, and they preside over the innumerable spiritual planets.</p>
<p>They are known by a variety of names--Purusottama, Trivikrama, Kesava, Madhava, Aniruddha, Hrsikesa, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Sridhara, Vasudeva, Damodara, Janardana, Narayana, Vamana, Padmanabha, etc.</p>
<p>These plenary expansions are likened unto the leaves of a tree, and the main tree is likened to Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna, dwelling in Goloka Vrndavana, His supreme abode, systematically conducts all affairs of both universes (material and spiritual) without a flaw by power of His all-pervasiveness.</p>

<p>The unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord who are totally surrendered souls do not care when they leave their bodies or by what method.</p>
<p>They leave everything in Krsna's hands and so easily and happily return to Godhead.</p>
<p>But those who are not unalloyed devotees and who depend instead on such methods of spiritual realization as karma-yoga, jnana-yoga, hatha-yoga, etc., must leave the body at a suitable time and thereby be assured whether or not they will return to the world of birth and death.</p>
<p>If the yogi is perfect, he can select the time and place for leaving this material world, but if he is not so perfect, then he has to leave at nature's will.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those who know the Supreme Brahman pass away from the world during the influence of the fiery god, in the light, at an auspicious moment, during the fortnight of the moon and the six months when the sun travels in the north.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When fire, light, day and moon are mentioned, it is to be understood that over all of them there are various presiding deities who make arrangements for the passage of the soul.</p>
<p>At the time of death, the jiva sets forth on the path to a new life.</p>
<p>If one leaves the body at the time designated above, either accidently or by arrangement, it is possible for him to attain the impersonal brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>Mystics who are advanced in yoga practice can arrange the time and place to leave the body.</p>
<p>Others have no control--if by accident they leave at an auspicious moment, then they will not return to the cycle of birth and death, but if not, then there is every possibility that they will have to return.</p>
<p>However, for the pure devotee in Krsna consciousness, there is no fear of returning, whether he leaves the body at an auspicious or inauspicious moment, by accident or arrangement.</p>

<p>Krsna is here advising Arjuna that he should not be disturbed by the different paths the soul can take when leaving the material world.</p>
<p>A devotee of the Supreme Lord should not worry whether he will depart either by arrangement or by accident.</p>
<p>The devotee should be firmly established in Krsna consciousness and chant Hare Krsna.</p>
<p>He should know that concern over either of these two paths is troublesome.</p>
<p>The best way to be absorbed in Krsna consciousness is to be always dovetailed in His service, and this will make one's path to the spiritual kingdom safe, certain, and direct.</p>
<p>The word yoga-yukta is especially significant in this verse.</p>
<p>One who is firm in yoga is constantly engaged in Krsna consciousness in all his activities.</p>
<p>Sri Rupa Gosvami advises that one should be unattached in the material world and that all affairs should be steeped in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A person who accepts the path of devotional service is not bereft of the results derived from studying the Vedas, performing austere sacrifices, giving charity or pursuing philosophical and fruitive activities.</p>
<p>At the end he reaches the supreme abode.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is the summation of the Seventh and Eighth Chapters, particularly as the chapters deal with Krsna consciousness and devotional service.</p>
<p>One has to study the Vedas under the guidance of the spiritual master and undergo many austerities and penances while living under his care.</p>
<p>A brahmacari has to live in the home of the spiritual master just like a servant, and he must beg alms from door to door and bring them to the spiritual master.</p>
<p>He takes food only under the master's order, and if the master neglects to call the student for food that day, the student fasts.</p>
<p>These are some of the Vedic principles for observing brahmacarya.</p>
<p>After the student studies the Vedas under the master for a period from five to twenty years, he may become a man of perfect character.</p>
<p>Study of the Vedas is not meant for the recreation of armchair speculators, but for the formation of character.</p>
<p>After this training, the brahmacari is allowed to enter into household life and marry.</p>
<p>When he is a householder, he also has to perform many sacrifices and strive for further enlightenment.</p>
<p>Then after retiring from household life, upon accepting the order of vanaprastha, he undergoes severe penances, such as living in forests, dressing with tree bark, not shaving, etc.</p>
<p>By carrying out the orders of brahmacari, householder, vanaprastha and finally sannyasa, one becomes elevated to the perfectional stage of life.</p>
<p>Some are then elevated to the heavenly kingdoms, and when they become even more advanced they are liberated in the spiritual sky, either in the impersonal brahmajyoti or in the Vaikuntha planets or Krsnaloka.</p>
<p>This is the path outlined by Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>The beauty of Krsna consciousness, however, is that by one stroke, by engaging in devotional service, one can surpass all rituals of the different orders of life.</p>
<p>One should try to understand the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of the Gita not by scholarship or mental speculation, but by hearing them in association with pure devotees.</p>
<p>Chapters Six through Twelve are the essence of the Gita.</p>
<p>If one is fortunate to understand the Gita--especially these middle six chapters--in the association of devotees, then his life at once becomes glorified beyond all penances, sacrifices, charities, speculations, etc.</p>
<p>One should hear the Gita from the devotee because at the beginning of the Fourth Chapter it is stated that the Gita can only be perfectly understood by devotees.</p>
<p>Hearing the Gita from devotees, not from mental speculators, is called faith.</p>
<p>Through association of devotees, one is placed in devotional service, and by this service Krsna's activities, form, pastimes, name, etc., become clear, and all misgivings are dispelled.</p>
<p>Then once doubts are removed, the study of the Gita becomes extremely pleasurable, and one develops a taste and feeling for Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In the advanced stage, one falls completely in love with Krsna, and that is the beginning of the highest perfectional stage of life which prepares the devotee's transferral to Krsna's abode in the spiritual sky, Goloka Vrndavana, where the devotee enters into eternal happiness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord said: My dear Arjuna, because you are never envious of Me, I shall impart to you this most secret wisdom, knowing which you shall be relieved of the miseries of material existence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As a devotee hears more and more about the Supreme Lord, he becomes enlightened.</p>
<p>This hearing process is recommended in the Srimad-Bhagavatam: "The messages of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are full of potencies, and these potencies can be realized if topics regarding the Supreme Godhead are discussed amongst devotees.</p>
<p>This cannot be achieved by the association of mental speculators or academic scholars, for it is realized knowledge."</p>
<p>The devotees are constantly engaged in the Supreme Lord's service.</p>
<p>The Lord understands the mentality and sincerity of a particular living entity who is engaged in Krsna consciousness and gives him the intelligence to understand the science of Krsna in the association of the devotees.</p>
<p>Discussion of Krsna is very potent, and if a fortunate person has such association and tries to assimilate the knowledge, then he will surely make advancement toward spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna, in order to encourage Arjuna to higher and higher elevation in His potent service, describes in this Ninth Chapter matters more confidential than any He has already disclosed.</p>
<p>The very beginning of Bhagavad-gita, the First Chapter, is more or less an introduction to the rest of the book; and in the Second and Third Chapters, the spiritual knowledge described is called confidential.</p>
<p>Topics discussed in the Seventh and Eighth Chapters are specifically related to devotional service, and because they bring enlightenment in Krsna consciousness, they are called more confidential.</p>
<p>But the matters which are described in the Ninth Chapter deal with unalloyed, pure devotion.</p>
<p>Therefore this is called the most confidential.</p>
<p>One who is situated in the most confidential knowledge of Krsna is naturally transcendental; he therefore has no material pangs, although he is in the material world.</p>
<p>In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu it is said that although one who has a sincere desire to render loving service to the Supreme Lord is situated in the conditional state of material existence, he is to be considered liberated.</p>
<p>Similarly, we shall find in the Bhagavad-gita, Tenth Chapter, that anyone who is engaged in that way is a liberated person.</p>
<p>Now this first verse has specific significance.</p>
<p>Knowledge (idam jnanam) refers to pure devotional service, which consists of nine different activities: hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping, praying, obeying, maintaining friendship and surrendering everything.</p>
<p>By the practice of these nine elements of devotional service one is elevated to spiritual consciousness, Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>At the time when one's heart is cleared of the material contamination, one can understand this science of Krsna.</p>
<p>Simply to understand that a living entity is not material is not sufficient.</p>
<p>That may be the beginning of spiritual realization, but one should recognize the difference between activities of the body and spiritual activities by which one understands that he is not the body.</p>
<p>In the Seventh Chapter we have already discussed the opulent potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His different energies, the inferior and superior natures, and all this material manifestation.</p>
<p>Now in Chapters Nine and Ten the glories of the Lord will be delineated.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word anasuyave in this verse is also very significant.</p>
<p>Generally the commentators, even if they are highly scholarly, are all envious of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Even the most erudite scholars write on Bhagavad-gita very inaccurately.</p>
<p>Because they are envious of Krsna, their commentaries are useless.</p>
<p>The commentaries given by devotees of the Lord are bona fide.</p>
<p>No one can explain Bhagavad-gita, or give perfect knowledge of Krsna if he is envious.</p>
<p>One who criticizes the character of Krsna without knowing Him is a fool.</p>
<p>So such commentaries should be very carefully avoided.</p>
<p>For one who understands that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the pure and transcendental Personality, these chapters will be very beneficial.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets.</p>
<p>It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion.</p>
<p>It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This chapter of Bhagavad-gita is called the king of education because it is the essence of all doctrines and philosophies explained before.</p>
<p>There are seven principal philosophers in India: Gautama, Kanada, Kapila, Yajnavalkya, Sandilya, Vaisvanara, and, finally, Vyasadeva, the author of the Vedanta-sutra.</p>
<p>So there is no dearth of knowledge in the field of philosophy or transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Now the Lord says that this Ninth Chapter is the king of all such knowledge, the essence of all knowledge that can be derived from the study of the Vedas and different kinds of philosophy.</p>
<p>It is the most confidential because confidential or transcendental knowledge involves understanding the difference between the soul and the body.</p>
<p>And the king of all confidential knowledge culminates in devotional service.</p>
<p>Generally, people are not educated in this confidential knowledge; they are educated in external knowledge.</p>
<p>As far as ordinary education is concerned, people are involved with so many departments: politics, sociology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, engineering, etc.</p>
<p>There are so many departments of knowledge all over the world and many huge universities, but there is, unfortunately, no university or educational institution where the science of the spirit soul is instructed.</p>
<p>Yet the soul is the most important part of this body; without the presence of the soul, the body has no value.</p>
<p>Still people are placing great stress on the bodily necessities of life, not caring for the vital soul.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita, especially from the Second Chapter on, stresses the importance of the soul.</p>
<p>In the very beginning, the Lord says that this body is perishable and that the soul is not perishable.</p>
<p>That is a confidential part of knowledge: simply knowing that spirit soul is different from this body and that its nature is immutable, indestructible and eternal.</p>
<p>But that gives no positive information about the soul.</p>
<p>Sometimes people are under the impression that the soul is different from the body and that when the body is finished, or one is liberated from the body, the soul remains in a void and becomes impersonal.</p>
<p>But actually that is not the fact.</p>
<p>How can the soul, which is so active within this body, be inactive after being liberated from the body? It is always active.</p>
<p>If it is eternal, then it is eternally active, and its activities in the spiritual kingdom are the most confidential part of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>These activities of the spirit soul are therefore indicated here as constituting the king of all knowledge, the most confidential part of all knowledge.</p>
<p>This knowledge is the purest form of all activities, as is explained in Vedic literature.</p>
<p>In the Padma Purana, man's sinful activities have been analyzed and are shown to be the results of sin after sin.</p>
<p>Those who are engaged in fruitive activities are entangled in different stages and forms of sinful reactions.</p>
<p>For instance, when the seed of a particular tree is sown, the tree does not appear immediately to grow; it takes some time.</p>
<p>It is first a small, sprouting plant, then it assumes the form of a tree, then it flowers, bears fruit, and, when it is complete, the flowers and fruits are enjoyed by persons who have sown the seed of the tree.</p>
<p>Similarly, a man performs a sinful act, and like a seed it takes time to fructify.</p>
<p>There are different stages.</p>
<p>The sinful action may have already stopped within the individual, but the results or the fruit of that sinful action are still enjoyed.</p>
<p>There are sins which are still in the form of a seed, and there are others which are already fructified and are giving us fruit, which we are enjoying as distress and pain, as explained in the twentieth verse of the Seventh Chapter.</p>
<p>A person who has completely ended the reactions of all sinful activities and who is fully engaged in pious activities, being freed from the duality of this material world, becomes engaged in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>In other words, those who are actually engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord are already freed from all reactions.</p>
<p>For those who are engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all sinful reactions, whether fructified, in the stock, or in the form of a seed, gradually vanish.</p>
<p>Therefore the purifying potency of devotional service is very strong, and it is called pavitram uttamam, the purest.</p>
<p>Uttamam means transcendental.</p>
<p>Tamas means this material world or darkness, and uttamam means that which is transcendental to material activities.</p>
<p>Devotional activities are never to be considered material, although sometimes it appears that devotees are engaged just like ordinary men.</p>
<p>One who can see and is familiar with devotional service, however, will know that they are not material activities.</p>
<p>They are all spiritual and devotional, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>It is said that the execution of devotional service is so perfect that one can perceive the results directly.</p>
<p>This direct result is actually perceived, and we have practical experience that any person who is chanting the holy names of Krsna (Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare) in course of time feels some transcendental pleasure and very quickly becomes purified of all material contamination.</p>
<p>This is actually seen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if one engages not only in hearing but in trying to broadcast the message of devotional activities as well, or if he engages himself in helping the missionary activities of Krsna consciousness, he gradually feels spiritual progress.</p>
<p>This advancement in spiritual life does not depend on any kind of previous education or qualification.</p>
<p>The method itself is so pure that by simply engaging in it one becomes pure.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutra this is also described in the following words: prakasas ca karmany abhyasat.</p>
<p>"Devotional service is so potent that simply by engaging in the activities of devotional service, one becomes enlightened without a doubt."</p>
<p>Narada, who happened to be the son of a maidservant, had no education, nor was he born into a high family.</p>
<p>But when his mother was engaged in serving great devotees, Narada also became engaged, and sometimes, in the absence of his mother, he would serve the great devotees himself.</p>
<p>Narada personally says, "Once only, by their permission, I took the remnants of their food, and by so doing all my sins were at once eradicated.</p>
<p>Thus being engaged, I became purified in heart, and at that time the very nature of the transcendentalist became attractive to me." (Bhag.1.5.25) Narada tells his disciple Vyasadeva that in a previous life he was engaged as a boy servant of purified devotees during four months of their stay and that he was intimately associating with them.</p>
<p>Sometimes those sages left remnants of food on their dishes, and the boy, who would wash their dishes, wanted to taste the remnants.</p>
<p>So he asked the great devotees whether he could eat them, and they gave their permission.</p>
<p>Narada then ate those remnants and consequently became freed from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>As he went on eating, he gradually became as purehearted as the sages, and he gradually developed the same taste.</p>
<p>The great devotees relished the taste of unceasing devotional service of the Lord, hearing, chanting, etc., and by developing the same taste, Narada wanted also to hear and chant the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus by associating with the sages, he developed a great desire for devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore he quotes from the Vedanta-sutra (prakasas ca karmany abhyasat): If one is engaged simply in the acts of devotional service, everything is revealed to him automatically, and he can understand.</p>
<p>This is called prakasah, directly perceived.</p>
<p>Narada was actually a son of a maidservant.</p>
<p>He had no opportunity to go to school.</p>
<p>He was simply assisting his mother, and fortunately his mother rendered some service to the devotees.</p>
<p>The child Narada also got the opportunity and simply by association achieved the highest goal of all religions, devotional service.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said that religious people generally do not know that the highest perfection of religion is the attainment of the stage of devotional service.</p>
<p>Generally Vedic knowledge is required for the understanding of the path of self-realization.</p>
<p>But here, although he was not educated in the Vedic principle, Narada acquired the highest results of Vedic study.</p>
<p>This process is so potent that even without performing the religious process regularly, one can be raised to the highest perfection.</p>
<p>How is this possible? This is also confirmed in Vedic literature: acaryavan puruso veda.</p>
<p>One who is in association with great acaryas, even if he is not educated or has not studied the Vedas, can become familiar with all the knowledge necessary for realization.</p>
<p>The process of devotional service is a very happy one.</p>
<p>Why? Devotional service consists of sravanam kirtanam visnoh, so one can simply hear the chanting of the glories of the Lord or can attend philosophical lectures on transcendental knowledge given by authorized acaryas.</p>
<p>Simply by sitting, one can learn; then one can eat the remnants of the food offered to God, nice palatable dishes.</p>
<p>In every state devotional service is joyful.</p>
<p>One can execute devotional service even in the most poverty-stricken condition.</p>
<p>The Lord says, patram puspam phalam: He is ready to accept from the devotee any kind of offering, never mind what.</p>
<p>Even a leaf, a flower, a bit of fruit, or a little water, which are all available in every part of the world, can be offered by any person, regardless of social position, and will be accepted if offered with love.</p>
<p>There are many instances in history.</p>
<p>Simply by tasting the tulasi leaves offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, great sages like Sanatkumara became great devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore the devotional process is very nice, and it can be executed in a happy mood.</p>
<p>God accepts only the love with which things are offered to Him.</p>
<p>It is said here that this devotional service is eternally existing.</p>
<p>It is not as the Mayavadi philosophers claim.</p>
<p>They sometimes take to so-called devotional service, and as long as they are not liberated they continue their devotional service, but at the end, when they become liberated, they "become one with God."</p>
<p>Such temporary time-serving devotional service is not accepted as pure devotional service.</p>
<p>Actual devotional service continues even after liberation.</p>
<p>When the devotee goes to the spiritual planet in the kingdom of God, he is also engaged there in serving the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He does not try to become one with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>As it will be seen, actual devotional service begins after liberation.</p>
<p>So in Bhagavad-gita it is said, brahma-bhuta.</p>
<p>After being liberated, or being situated in the Brahman position, one's devotional service begins.</p>
<p>By executing devotional service, one can understand the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>No one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by executing karma-yoga, jnana, or astanga-yoga or any other yoga independantly.</p>
<p>Without coming to the stage of devotional service, one cannot understand what is the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is also confirmed that when one becomes purified by executing the process of devotional service, especially by hearing Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita from realized souls, then he can understand the science of Krsna or the science of God.</p>
<p>Evam prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogatah.</p>
<p>When one's heart is cleared of all nonsense, then one can understand what God is.</p>
<p>Thus the process of devotional service, of Krsna consciousness, is the king of all education and the king of all confidential knowledge.</p>
<p>It is the purest form of religion, and it can be executed joyfully without difficulty.</p>
<p>Therefore one should adopt it.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The faithless cannot accomplish this process of devotional service; that is the purport of this verse.</p>
<p>Faith is created by association with devotees.</p>
<p>Unfortunate people, even after hearing all the evidence of Vedic literature from great personalities, still have no faith in God.</p>
<p>They are hesitant and cannot stay fixed in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus faith is a most important factor for progress in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In the Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that one should have complete conviction that simply by serving the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna he can achieve all perfection.</p>
<p>That is called real faith.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.4.12) it is stated that by giving water to the root of a tree, its branches, twigs and leaves become satisfied, and by supplying food to the stomach all the senses of the body become satisfied, and, similarly, by engaging in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, all the demigods and all the living entities automatically become satisfied.</p>
<p>After reading Bhagavad-gita one should promptly come to the conclusion of Bhagavad-gita: one should give up all other engagements and adopt the service of the Supreme Lord, Krsna, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If one is convinced of this philosophy of life, that is faith.</p>
<p>Now the development of that faith is the process of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>There are three divisions of Krsna conscious men.</p>
<p>In the third class are those who have no faith.</p>
<p>If they are engaged in devotional service officially, for some ulterior purpose, they cannot achieve the highest perfectional stage.</p>
<p>Most probably they will slip, after some time.</p>
<p>They may become engaged, but because they haven't complete conviction and faith, it is very difficult for them to continue in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>We have practical experience in discharging our missionary activity that some people come and apply themselves to the Krsna consciousness with some hidden motive, and as soon as they are economically a little well-situated, they give up this process and take to their old ways again.</p>
<p>It is only by faith that one can advance in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>As far as the development of faith is concerned, one who is well versed in the literatures of devotional service and has attained the stage of firm faith is called a first-class person in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>And in the second class are those who are not very advanced in understanding the devotional scriptures but who automatically have firm faith that Krsna bhakti or service to Krsna is the best course and so in good faith have taken it up.</p>
<p>Thus they are superior to the third class who have neither perfect knowledge of the scriptures nor good faith but by association and simplicity are trying to follow.</p>
<p>The third-class person in Krsna consciousness may fall down, but when one is in the second class or first class, he does not fall down.</p>
<p>One in the first class will surely make progress and achieve the result at the end.</p>
<p>As far as the third-class person in Krsna consciousness is concerned, although he has faith in the conviction that devotional service to Krsna is very good, he has no knowledge of Krsna through the scriptures like Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Sometimes these third-class persons in Krsna consciousness have some tendency toward karma-yoga and jnana-yoga, and sometimes they are disturbed, but as soon as the infection of karma-yoga or jnana-yoga is vanquished, they become second-class or first-class persons in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Faith in Krsna is also divided into three stages and described in Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>First-class attachment, second-class attachment, and third-class attachment are also explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam in the Eleventh Canto.</p>
<p>Those who have no faith even after hearing about Krsna and the excellence of devotional service, who think that it is simply eulogy, find the path very difficult, even if they are supposedly engaged in devotional service.</p>
<p>For them there is very little hope in gaining perfection.</p>
<p>Thus faith is very important in the discharge of devotional service.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.</p>
<p>All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not perceivable through the gross material senses.</p>
<p>It is said that Lord Sri Krsna's name, fame, pastimes, etc., cannot be understood by material senses.</p>
<p>Only to one who is engaged in pure devotional service under proper guidance is He revealed.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated, premanjanacchurita.... One can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, always within himself and outside himself if he has developed the transcendental loving attitude towards Him.</p>
<p>Thus for people in general He is not visible.</p>
<p>Here it is said that although He is all-pervading, everywhere present, He is yet not conceivable by the material senses.</p>
<p>But actually, although we cannot see Him, everything is resting in Him.</p>
<p>As we have discussed in the Seventh Chapter, the entire material cosmic manifestation is only a combination of His two different energies, the superior spiritual energy and the inferior material energy.</p>
<p>Just as the sunshine is spread all over the universe, the energy of the Lord is spread all over the creation, and everything is resting in that energy.</p>
<p>Yet one should not conclude that because He is spread all over He has lost His personal existence.</p>
<p>To refute such argument the Lord says, "I am everywhere, and everything is in Me, but still I am aloof."</p>
<p>For example, a king heads a government which is but the manifestation of the king's energy; the different governmental departments are nothing but the energies of the king, and each department is resting on the king's power.</p>
<p>But still one cannot expect the king to be present in every department personally.</p>
<p>That is a crude example.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the manifestations that we see, and everything that exists both in this material world and in the spiritual world, are resting on the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The creation takes place by the diffusion of His different energies, and, as is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, He is everywhere present by His personal representation, the diffusion of His different energies.</p>

<p>And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me.</p>
<p>Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities, and although I am everywhere, still My Self is the very source of creation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says that everything is resting on Him.</p>
<p>This should not be misunderstood.</p>
<p>The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation.</p>
<p>Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding an earth-globe on his shoulders, although Bhu-mandala or the earth-disc, is not a globe (Srimad-Bhagavatam 5.1.31-5.26.5), Atlas seems to be very tired.</p>
<p>Such an image should not be entertained in connection with Krsna's upholding this created universe.</p>
<p>He says that although everything is resting on Him, still He is aloof.</p>
<p>The planetary systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>But He is different from space.</p>
<p>He is differently situated.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord says, "Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, still, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I am aloof from them."</p>
<p>This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the Vedic dictionary it is said, "The Supreme Lord is performing inconceivably wonderful pastimes, displaying His energy.</p>
<p>His person is full of different potent energies, and His determination is itself actual fact.</p>
<p>In this way the Personality of Godhead is to be understood."</p>
<p>We may think to do something, but there are so many impediments, and sometimes it is not possible to do as we like.</p>
<p>But when Krsna wants to do something, simply by His willing, everything is performed so perfectly that one cannot imagine how it is being done.</p>
<p>The Lord explains this fact: although He is the maintainer and sustainer of all material manifestation, He does not touch this material manifestation.</p>
<p>Simply by His supreme will everything is created, everything is sustained, everything is maintained, and everything is annihilated.</p>
<p>There is no difference between His mind and Himself (as there is a difference between ourselves and our present material mind) because He is absolute spirit.</p>
<p>Simultaneously the Lord is present in everything; yet the common man cannot understand how He is also present personally.</p>
<p>He is different from this material manifestation, yet everything is resting on Him.</p>
<p>This is explained here as yogam aisvaram, the mystic power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As the mighty wind, blowing everywhere, always rests in ethereal space know that in the same manner all beings rest in Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>For the ordinary person it is almost inconceivable how the huge material creation is resting in Him.</p>
<p>But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand.</p>
<p>Space is the biggest manifestation we can conceive.</p>
<p>The cosmic manifestation rests in space.</p>
<p>Space permits the movement of even the atoms and on up to the greatest planets, the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>Although the sky (or wind or air) is great, still it is situated within space.</p>
<p>Space is not beyond the sky.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will.</p>
<p>As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated.</p>
<p>Still He is aloof from everything, as space is always aloof from the activities of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the Upanisads, it is stated, "It is out of the fear of the Supreme Lord that the wind is blowing."</p>
<p>In the Garga Upanisad also it is stated, "By the supreme order, under the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the moon, the sun and the great planets are moving."</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita this is also stated.</p>
<p>There is also a description of the movement of the sun, and it is said that the sun is considered to be one of the eyes of the Supreme Lord and that it has immense potency to diffuse heat and light.</p>
<p>Still it is moving in its prescribed orbit by the order and the supreme will of Govinda.</p>
<p>So, from the Vedic literature we can find evidence that this material manifestation, which appears to us to be very wonderful and great, is under the complete control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This will be further explained in the later verses of this chapter.</p>

<p>O son of Kunti, at the end of the millennium every material manifestation enters into My nature, and at the beginning of another millennium, by My potency I again create.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material cosmic manifestation is completely dependant on the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>"At the end of the millennium" means at the death of Brahma.</p>
<p>Brahma lives for one hundred years, and his one day is calculated at 4,300,000,000 of our earthly years.</p>
<p>His night is of the same duration.</p>
<p>His month consists of thirty such days and nights, and his year of twelve months.</p>
<p>After one hundred such years, when Brahma dies, the devastation or annihilation takes place; this means that the energy manifested by the Supreme Lord is again wound up in Himself.</p>
<p>Then again, when there is need to manifest the cosmic world, it is done by His will: "Although I am one, I shall become many."</p>
<p>This is the Vedic aphorism.</p>
<p>He expands Himself in this material energy, and the whole cosmic manifestation again takes place.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The whole cosmic order is under Me.</p>
<p>By My will it is manifested again and again, and by My will it is annihilated at the end.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This matter is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This has already been explained several times.</p>
<p>At the creation, the material energy is let loose as mahat-tattva, into which the Lord as His first Purusa incarnation, Maha-Visnu, enters.</p>
<p>He lies within the Causal Ocean and breathes out innumerable universes, and into each universe the Lord again enters as Garbhodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Each universe is in that way created.</p>
<p>He still further manifests Himself as Ksirodakasayi Visnu, and that Visnu enters into everything--even into the minute atom.</p>
<p>This fact is explained here.</p>
<p>He enters into everything.</p>
<p>Now, as far as the living entities are concerned, they are impregnated into this material nature, and as a result of their past deeds they take different positions.</p>
<p>Thus the activities of this material world begin.</p>
<p>The activities of the different species of living beings are begun from the very moment of the creation.</p>
<p>It is not that all is evolved.</p>
<p>The different species of life are created immediately along with the universe.</p>
<p>Men, animals, beasts, birds--everything is simultaneously created, because whatever desires the living entities had at the last annihilation are again manifested.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated here that the living entities have nothing to do with this process.</p>
<p>The state of being in their past life in the past creation is simply manifested again, and all this is done simply by His will.</p>
<p>This is the inconceivable potency of the Supreme Personality of God.</p>
<p>And after creating different species of life, He has no connection with them.</p>
<p>The creation takes place to accommodate the inclinations of the various living entities, and so the Lord does not become involved with it.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should not think, in this connection, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no engagement.</p>
<p>In His spiritual world He is always engaged.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated: "He is always involved in His eternal, blissful, spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities."</p>
<p>Material activities are being carried on by His different potencies.</p>
<p>The Lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created world.</p>
<p>This neutrality is explained here.</p>
<p>Although He has control over every minute detail of matter, He is sitting as if neutral.</p>
<p>The example can be given of a high court judge sitting on his bench.</p>
<p>By his order so many things are happening: someone is being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount of wealth--but still he is neutral.</p>
<p>He has nothing to do with all that gain and loss.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every sphere of activity.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutra it is stated that He is not situated in the dualities of this material world.</p>
<p>He is transcendental to these dualities.</p>
<p>Nor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world.</p>
<p>The living entities take their different forms in the various species of life according to their past deeds, and the Lord doesn't interfere with them.</p>

<p>This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.</p>
<p>By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the activities of the material world, remains the supreme director.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature.</p>
<p>Krsna also states in Bhagavad-gita that of all the living entities in different forms and species, "I am the Father."</p>
<p>The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities.</p>
<p>All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires.</p>
<p>So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation.</p>
<p>He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately.</p>
<p>Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly.</p>
<p>This example is given in the smrti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another.</p>
<p>There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains.</p>
<p>In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything.</p>
<p>Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities.</p>

<p>Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.</p>
<p>They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the other explanations of the previous verses in this chapter, it is clear that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing like a human being, is not a common man.</p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the complete cosmic manifestation, cannot be a human being.</p>
<p>Yet there are many foolish men who consider Kr,sna to be merely a powerful man and nothing more.</p>
<p>Actually, He is the original Supreme Personality, as is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita (isvarah paramah krsnah); He is the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>There are many isvaras, controllers, and one appears greater than another.</p>
<p>In the ordinary management of affairs in the material world, we find some official or director, and above him there is a secretary, and above him a minister, and above him a president.</p>
<p>Each of them is a controller, but one is controlled by another.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is said that Krsna is the supreme controller; there are many controllers undoubtedly both in the material and spiritual world, but Krsna is the supreme controller (isvarah paramah krsnah), and His body is sac-cid-ananda, non-material.</p>
<p>Material bodies cannot perform the wonderful acts described in previous verses.</p>
<p>His body is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge.</p>
<p>Although He is not a common man, the foolish deride Him and consider Him to be a man.</p>
<p>His body is called here manusim because He is acting just like a man, a friend of Arjuna's, a politician involved in the Battle of Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>In so many ways He is acting just like an ordinary man, but actually His body is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha--eternal bliss and knowledge absolute.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Vedic language also (sac-cid-ananda-rupaya krsnaya): "I offer my obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the eternal blissful form of knowledge."</p>
<p>There are other descriptions in the Vedic language also.</p>
<p>Tam ekam govindam: "You are Govinda, the pleasure of the senses and the cows."</p>
<p>Sac-cid-ananda-vigraham: "And Your form is transcendental, full of knowledge, bliss and eternality."</p>
<p>Despite the transcendental qualities of Lord Krsna's body, its full bliss and knowledge, there are many so-called scholars and commentators of Bhagavad-gita who deride Krsna as an ordinary man.</p>
<p>The scholar may be born an extraordinary man due to his previous good work, but this conception of Sri Krsna is due to a poor fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore he is called mudha, for only foolish persons consider Krsna to be an ordinary human being because they do not know the confidential activities of the Supreme Lord and His different energies.</p>
<p>They do not know that Krsna's body is a symbol of complete knowledge and bliss, that He is the proprietor of everything that be and that He can award liberation to anyone.</p>
<p>Because they do not know that Krsna has so many transcendental qualifications, they deride Him.</p>
<p>Nor do they know that the appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world is a manifestation of His internal energy.</p>
<p>He is the master of the material energy.</p>
<p>As has been explained in several places (mama maya duratyaya), He claims that the material energy, although very powerful, is under His control, and whoever surrenders unto Him can get out of the control of this material energy.</p>
<p>If a soul surrendered to Krsna can get out of the influence of material energy, then how can the Supreme Lord, who conducts the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the whole cosmic nature, have a material body like us? So this conception of Krsna is complete foolishness.</p>
<p>Foolish persons, however, cannot conceive that the Personality of Godhead, Krsna, appearing just like an ordinary man, can be the controller of all the atoms and of the gigantic manifestation of the universal form.</p>
<p>The biggest and the minutest are beyond their conception, so they cannot imagine that a form like that of a human being can simultaneously control the infinite and the minute.</p>
<p>Actually although He is controlling the infinite and the finite, He is apart from all this manifestation.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated concerning His yogam aisvaram, His inconceivable transcendental energy, that He can control the infinite and the finite simultaneously and that He can remain aloof from them.</p>
<p>Although the foolish cannot imagine how Krsna, who appears just like a human being, can control the infinite and the finite, those who are pure devotees accept this, for they know that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore they completely surrender unto Him and engage in Krsna consciousness, devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many controversies amongst the impersonalists and the personalists about the Lord's appearance as a human being.</p>
<p>But if we consult Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, the authoritative texts for understanding the science of Krsna, then we can understand that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is not an ordinary man, although He appeared on this earth as an ordinary human.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, First Canto, First Chapter, when the sages inquire about the activities of Krsna, it is stated that His appearance as a man bewilders the foolish.</p>
<p>No human being could perform the wonderful acts that Krsna performed while He was present on this earth.</p>
<p>When Krsna appeared before His father and mother, Vasudeva and Devaki, He appeared with four hands, but after the prayers of the parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.</p>
<p>His appearance as an ordinary human being is one of the features of His transcendental body.</p>
<p>In the Eleventh Chapter of the Gita also it is stated, tenaiva rupena etc.</p>
<p>Arjuna prayed to see again that form of four hands, and when Krsna was thus petitioned by Arjuna, He again assumed His original form.</p>
<p>All these different features of the Supreme Lord are certainly not those of an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>Some of those who deride Krsna, who are infected with the Mayavadi philosophy, quote the following verse from the Srimad-Bhagavatam to prove that Krsna is just an ordinary man: aham sarvesu bhutesu bhutatmavasthitah sada: "The Supreme is present in every living entity." (Bhag.3.29.21) We should better take note of this particular verse from the Vaisnava acaryas like Jiva Gosvami instead of following the interpretation of unauthorized persons who deride Krsna.</p>
<p>Jiva Gosvami, commenting on this verse, says that Krsna, in His plenary expansion as Paramatma, is situated in the moving and the nonmoving entities as the Supersoul, so any neophyte devotee who simply gives his attention to the arca-murti, the form of the Supreme Lord in the temple, and does not respect other living entities is uselessly worshiping the form of the Lord in the temple.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of devotees of the Lord, and the neophyte is in the lowest stage.</p>
<p>The neophyte devotee gives more attention to the Deity in the temple than to other devotees, so Jiva Gosvami warns that this sort of mentality should be corrected.</p>
<p>A devotee should see that Krsna is present in everyone's heart as Paramatma; therefore every body is the embodiment or the temple of the Supreme Lord, and as such, as one offers respect to the temple of the Lord, he should similarly properly respect each and every body in whom the Paramatma dwells.</p>
<p>Everyone should therefore be given proper respect and should not be neglected.</p>
<p>There are also many impersonalists who deride temple worship.</p>
<p>They say that since God is everywhere, why should one restrict himself to temple worship? But if God is everywhere, is He not in the temple or in the Deity? Although the personalist and the impersonalist will fight with one another perpetually, a perfect devotee in Krsna consciousness knows that although Krsna is the Supreme Personality, He is all-pervading, as is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita.</p>
<p>Although His personal abode is Goloka Vrndavana and He is always staying there, still, by His different manifestations of energy and by His plenary expansion, He is present everywhere in all parts of the material and spiritual creation.</p>

<p>There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Krsna consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, as the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>For them, the fruit of devotional service--going back to Godhead--will never be tasted.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive, pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>In other words, persons who mock Krsna are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic.</p>
<p>As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, such demonic miscreants never surrender to Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and Krsna are one and the same.</p>
<p>With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself.</p>
<p>This attempt to become one with Krsna will be baffled because of delusion.</p>
<p>Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile.</p>
<p>That is the indication of this verse.</p>
<p>For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like the Vedanta-sutra and the Upanisads, is always baffled.</p>
<p>It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man.</p>
<p>Those who do so are certainly deluded because they cannot understand the eternal form of Krsna.</p>
<p>In the Brhad-vaisnava mantra it is clearly stated that one who considers the body of Krsna to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the sruti.</p>
<p>And if one by chance sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection.</p>
<p>People jeer at Krsna because they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life.</p>
<p>Perpetually, their real knowledge will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature.</p>
<p>They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the description of mahatma is clearly given.</p>
<p>The first sign of the mahatma is that he is already situated in the divine nature.</p>
<p>He is not under the control of material nature.</p>
<p>And how is this effected? That is explained in the Seventh Chapter: one who surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, at once becomes freed from the control of material nature.</p>
<p>That is the qualification.</p>
<p>One can become free from the control of material nature as soon as he surrenders his soul to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That is the preliminary formula.</p>
<p>Being marginal potency, as soon as the living entity is freed from the control of material nature, he is put under the guidance of the spiritual nature.</p>
<p>The guidance of the spiritual nature is called daivim prakrtim, divine nature.</p>
<p>So, when one is promoted in that way--by surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead--one attains to the stage of great soul, mahatma.</p>
<p>The mahatma does not divert his attention to anything outside Krsna because he knows perfectly well that Krsna is the original Supreme Person, the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Such a mahatma, or great soul, develops through association with other mahatmas, pure devotees.</p>
<p>Pure devotees are not even attracted by Krsna's other features, such as the four-armed Maha-Visnu.</p>
<p>They are simply attracted by the two-armed form of Krsna.</p>
<p>Since they are not attracted to other features of Krsna (what to speak of the demigods), they are not concerned with any form of a demigod or of a human being.</p>
<p>They only meditate upon Krsna in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>They are always engaged in the unswerving service of the Lord in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The mahatma cannot be manufactured by rubber-stamping an ordinary man.</p>
<p>His symptoms are described here: a mahatma is always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord Krsna, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He has no other business.</p>
<p>He is always engaged in the glorification of the Lord.</p>
<p>In other words, he is not an impersonalist.</p>
<p>When the question of glorification is there, one has to glorify the Supreme Lord, praising His holy name, His eternal form, His transcendental qualities and His uncommon pastimes.</p>
<p>One has to glorify all these things; therefore a mahatma is attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One who is attached to the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord, the brahmajyoti, is not described as mahatma in the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>He is described in a different way in the next verse.</p>
<p>The mahatma is always engaged in different activities of devotional service, as described in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, hearing and chanting about Visnu, not a demigod or human being.</p>
<p>That is devotion: sravanam kirtanam visnoh, smaranam, and remembering Him.</p>
<p>Such a mahatma has firm determination to achieve at the ultimate end the association of the Supreme Lord in any one of the five transcendental rasas.</p>
<p>To achieve that success, he engages all activities--mental, bodily and vocal, everything--in the service of the Supreme Lord, Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>That is called full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In devotional service there are certain activities which are called determined, such as fasting on certain days, like the eleventh day of the moon, Ekadasi, and on the appearance day of the Lord, etc.</p>
<p>All these rules and regulations are offered by the great acaryas for those who are actually interested in getting admission into the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the transcendental world.</p>
<p>The mahatmas, great souls, strictly observe all these rules and regulations, and therefore they are sure to achieve the desired result.</p>
<p>As described in the second verse of this chapter, this devotional service is not only easy, but it can be performed in a happy mood.</p>
<p>One does not need to undergo any severe penance and austerity.</p>
<p>He can live this life in devotional service, guided by an expert spiritual master, and in any position, either as a householder or a sannyasi, or a brahmacari; in any position and anywhere in the world, he can perform this devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus become actually mahatma, a great soul.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Others, who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, diverse in many, and in the universal form.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is the summary of the previous verses.</p>
<p>The Lord tells Arjuna that those who are purely in Krsna consciousness and do not know anything other than Krsna are called mahatma; yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position of mahatma but who worship Krsna also, in different ways.</p>
<p>Some of them are already described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge.</p>
<p>But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: 1) He who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, 2) He who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and 3) He who accepts the universal form, the visvarupa of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that.</p>
<p>Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant.</p>
<p>Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves.</p>
<p>This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent.</p>
<p>Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way.</p>
<p>The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>And the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe.</p>
<p>They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that.</p>
<p>The universe is also a form of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The sacrifice known as jyotistoma is also Krsna, and He is also the maha-yajna The oblations offered to the Pitrloka or the sacrifice performed to please the Pitrloka, considered as a kind of drug in the form of clarified butter, is also Krsna.</p>
<p>The mantras chanted in this connection are also Krsna.</p>
<p>And many other commodities made with milk products for offering in the sacrifices are also Krsna.</p>
<p>The fire is also Krsna because fire is one of the five material elements and is therefore claimed as the separated energy of Krsna.</p>
<p>In other words, the Vedic sacrifices recommended in the karma-kanda division of the Vedas are in total also Krsna.</p>
<p>Or, in other words, those who are engaged in rendering devotional service unto Krsna are to be understood to have performed all the sacrifices recommended in the Vedas.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The entire cosmic manifestations, moving and nonmoving, are manifested by different activities of Krsna's energy.</p>
<p>In the material existence we create different relationships with different living entities who are nothing but Krsna's marginal energy, but under the creation of prakrti some of them appear as our father, mother, grandfather, creator, etc., but actually they are parts and parcels of Krsna.</p>
<p>As such, these living entities who appear to be our father, mother, etc., are nothing but Krsna.</p>
<p>In this verse the word dhata means creator.</p>
<p>Not only are our father and mother parts and parcels of Krsna, but their creator, grandmother, and grandfather, etc., are also Krsna.</p>
<p>Actually any living entity, being part and parcel of Krsna, is Krsna.</p>
<p>All the Vedas, therefore, aim only toward Krsna.</p>
<p>Whatever we want to know through the Vedas is but a progressive step to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>That subject matter which helps us purify our constitutional position is especially Krsna.</p>
<p>Similarly, the living entity who is inquisitive to understand all Vedic principles is also part and parcel of Krsna and as such is also Krsna.</p>
<p>In all the Vedic mantras the word om, called pranava, is a transcendental sound vibration and is also Krsna.</p>
<p>And because in all the hymns of the four Vedas, Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva, the pranava or omkara is very prominent, it is understood to be Krsna.</p>

<p>I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend.</p>
<p>I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Gati means the destination where we want to go.</p>
<p>But the ultimate goal is Krsna, although people do not know it.</p>
<p>One who does not know Krsna is misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory.</p>
<p>There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka, Suryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc.</p>
<p>But all such lokas or planets, being creations of Krsna, are simultaneously Krsna and not Krsna.</p>
<p>Actually such planets, being the manifestations of Krsna's energy, are also Krsna, but actually they only serve as a step forward for realization of Krsna.</p>
<p>To approach the different energies of Krsna is to approach Krsna indirectly.</p>
<p>One should directly approach Krsna, for that will save time and energy.</p>
<p>For example, if there is a possibility of going to the top of a building by the help of an elevator, why should one go by the staircase, step by step? Everything is resting on Krsna's energy; therefore without Krsna's shelter nothing can exist.</p>
<p>Krsna is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy.</p>
<p>Krsna, being situated in everyone's heart, is the supreme witness.</p>
<p>The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of Krsna either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition.</p>
<p>And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a living force.</p>
<p>Thus Krsna is the supreme living entity.</p>
<p>Since Krsna is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than Krsna, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher.</p>
<p>Krsna is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation.</p>
<p>Krsna is therefore the eternal cause of all causes.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency of electricity and the sun.</p>
<p>During summer season it is Krsna who checks rain from falling from the sky, and then, during the rainy season, He gives unceasing torrents of rain.</p>
<p>The energy which sustains us by prolonging the duration of our life is Krsna, and Krsna meets us at the end as death.</p>
<p>By analyzing all these different energies of Krsna, one can acertain that for Krsna there is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words, He is both matter and spirit.</p>
<p>In the advanced stage of Krsna consciousness, one does not therefore make such distinctions.</p>
<p>He sees Krsna only in everything.</p>
<p>Since Krsna is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form comprising all material manifestations is also Krsna, and His pastimes in Vrndavana as two-handed Syamasundara, playing on a flute, are those of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>The word trai-vidyah refers to the three Vedas, Sama, Yajur and Rg.</p>
<p>A brahmana who has studied these three Vedas is called a tri-vedi.</p>
<p>Anyone who is very much attached to knowledge derived from these three Vedas is respected in society.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many great scholars of the Vedas who do not know the ultimate purport of studying them.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna herein declares Himself to be the ultimate goal for the tri-vedis.</p>
<p>Actual tri-vedis take shelter under the lotus feet of Krsna and engage in pure devotional service to satisfy the Lord.</p>
<p>Devotional service begins with the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra and side by side trying to understand Krsna in truth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately those who are simply official students of the Vedas become more interested in offering sacrifices to the different demigods like Indra, Candra, etc.</p>
<p>By such endeavor, the worshipers of different demigods are certainly purified of the contamination of the lower qualities of nature and are thereby elevated to the higher planetary system or heavenly planets known as Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, etc.</p>

<p>"Persons who are engaged in the worship of demigods are not very intelligent, although such worship is done to Me indirectly," Krsna says.</p>
<p>For example, when a man pours water on the leaves and branches of a tree without pouring water on the root, he does so without sufficient knowledge or without observing regulative principles.</p>
<p>Similarly, the process of rendering service to different parts of the body is to supply food to the stomach.</p>
<p>The demigods are, so to speak, different officers and directors in the government of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>One has to follow the laws made by the government, not by the officers or directors.</p>
<p>Similarly, everyone is to offer his worship to the Supreme Lord only.</p>
<p>That will automatically satisfy the different officers and directors of the Lord.</p>
<p>The officers and directors are engaged as representatives of the government, and to offer some bribe to the officers and directors is illegal.</p>

<p>Here it is clearly stated that there are many types of yajna performances recommended in the Vedic literatures, but actually all of them are meant for satisfying the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Yajna means Visnu.</p>
<p>In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gita it is clearly stated that one should only work for satisfying Yajna or Visnu.</p>
<p>The perfectional form of human civilization, known as varnasrama-dharma, is specifically meant for satisfying Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore, Krsna says in this verse, "I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices because I am the supreme master."</p>
<p>However, less intelligent persons, without knowing this fact, worship demigods for temporary benefit.</p>
<p>Therefore they fall down to material existence and do not achieve the desired goal of life.</p>
<p>If, however, anyone has any material desire to be fulfilled, he had better pray for it to the Supreme Lord (although that is not pure devotion), and he will thus achieve the desired result.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If anyone has any desire to go to the moon, the sun, or any other planet, one can attain the desired destination by following specific Vedic principles recommended for that purpose.</p>
<p>These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the Vedas, technically known as darsa-paurnamasi, which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Similarly, one can attain the pita planets by performing a specific yajna.</p>
<p>Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become a yaksa, raksa or pisaca.</p>
<p>Pisaca worship is called "black arts" or "black magic."</p>
<p>There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic.</p>
<p>Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets of Vaikuntha and Krsnaloka without a doubt.</p>
<p>It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the pita achieve the pita planets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet of Krsna or Visnu? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets where Krsna and Visnu live, and because they do not know of them they fall down.</p>
<p>Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>This Krsna consciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting the Hare Krsna mantra one can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit a water, I will accept it.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here Lord Krsna, having established that He is the only enjoyer, the primeval Lord, and the real object of all sacrificial offerings, reveals what types of sacrifices He desires to be offered.</p>
<p>If one wishes to engage in devotional service to the Supreme in order to be purified and to reach the goal of life--the transcendental loving service of God--then he should find out what the Lord desires of him.</p>
<p>One who loves Krsna will give Him whatever He wants, and he avoids offering anything which is undesirable or unasked for.</p>
<p>Thus, meat, fish and eggs should not be offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>If He desired such things as offerings, He would have said so.</p>
<p>Instead He clearly requests that a leaf, fruit, flowers and water be given to Him, and He says of this offering, "I will accept it."</p>
<p>Therefore, we should understand that He will not accept meat, fish and eggs.</p>
<p>Vegetables, grains, fruits, milk and water are the proper foods for human beings and are prescribed by Lord Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>Whatever else we eat cannot be offered to Him, since He will not accept it.</p>
<p>Thus we cannot be acting on the level of loving devotion if we offer such foods.</p>
<p>In the Third Chapter, verse thirteen, Sri Krsna explains that only the remains of sacrifice are purified and fit for consumption by those who are seeking advancement in life and release from the clutches of the material entanglement.</p>
<p>Those who do not make an offering of their food, He says in the same verse, are said to be eating only sin.</p>
<p>In other words, their every mouthful is simply deepening their involvement in the complexities of material nature.</p>
<p>But preparing nice, simple vegetable dishes, offering them before the picture or Deity of Lord Krsna and bowing down and praying for Him to accept such a humble offering, enable one to advance steadily in life, to purify the body, and to create fine brain tissues which will lead to clear thinking.</p>
<p>Above all, the offering should be made with an attitude of love.</p>
<p>Krsna has no need of food, since He already possesses everything that be, yet He will accept the offering of one who desires to please Him in that way.</p>
<p>The important element, in preparation, in serving and in offering, is to act with love for Krsna.</p>
<p>The impersonalist philosophers, who wish to maintain that the Absolute Truth is without senses, cannot comprehend this verse of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>To them, it is either a metaphor or proof of the mundane character of Krsna, the speaker of the Gita.</p>
<p>But, in actuality, Krsna, the Supreme Godhead, has senses, and it is stated that His senses are interchangeable; in other words, one sense can perform the function of any other.</p>
<p>This is what it means to say that Krsna is absolute.</p>
<p>Lacking senses, He could hardly be considered full in all opulences.</p>
<p>In the Seventh Chapter, Krsna has explained that He impregnates the living entities into material nature.</p>
<p>This is done by His looking upon material nature.</p>
<p>And so in this instance, Krsna's hearing the devotee's words of love in offering foodstuffs is wholly identical with His eating and actually tasting.</p>
<p>This point should be emphasized: because of His absolute position, His hearing is wholly identical with His eating and tasting.</p>
<p>Only the devotee, who accepts Krsna as He describes Himself, without interpretation, can understand that the Supreme Absolute Truth can eat food and enjoy it.</p>

<p>O son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Thus, it is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget Krsna in any circumstance.</p>
<p>Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and Krsna recommends herein that one should work for Him.</p>
<p>Everyone has to eat something to live; therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies; therefore Krsna recommends, "Do it for Me," and this is called arcana.</p>
<p>Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity; Krsna says, "Give it to Me," and this means that all surplus money accummulated should be utilized in furthering the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age, but if anyone practices meditating on Krsna twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra round his beads, he is surely the greatest yogi, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this way you will be freed from all reactions to good and evil deeds, and by this principle of renunciation you will be liberated and come to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who acts in Krsna consciousness under superior direction is called yukta.</p>
<p>The technical term is yukta-vairagya.</p>
<p>This is further explained by Rupa Gosvami as follows.</p>
<p>Rupa Gosvami says that as long as we are in this material world we have to act; we cannot cease acting.</p>
<p>Therefore if actions are performed and the fruits are given to Krsna, then that is called yukta-vairagya.</p>
<p>Actually situated in renunciation, such activities clear the mirror of the mind, and as the actor gradually makes progress in spiritual realization he becomes completely surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore at the end he becomes liberated, and this liberation is also specified.</p>
<p>By this liberation he does not become one with the brahmajyoti but rather enters into the planet of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>It is clearly mentioned here: mam upaisyasi, "he comes to Me," back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>There are five different stages of liberation, and here it is specified that the devotee who has always lived his lifetime here under the direction of the Supreme Lord, as stated, has evolved to the point where he can, after quitting this body, go back to Godhead and engage directly in the association of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Anyone who has no other interest but to dedicate his life to the service of the Lord is actually a sannyasi Such a person always thinks of himself as an eternal servant, dependant on the supreme will of the Lord.</p>
<p>As such, whatever he does, he does it for the benefit of the Lord.</p>
<p>Whatever action he performs, he performs it as service to the Lord.</p>
<p>He does not give serious attention to the fruitive activities or prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas.</p>
<p>For ordinary persons it is obligatory to execute the prescribed duties mentioned in the Vedas, but although a pure devotee who is completely engaged in the service of the Lord may sometimes appear to go against the prescribed Vedic duties, actually it is not so.</p>
<p>It is said, therefore, by Vaisnava authorities that even the most intelligent person cannot understand the plans and activities of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>The exact words are vaisnavera kriya mudra vijne na bujhaya.</p>
<p>A person who is thus always engaged in the service of the Lord or is always thinking and planning how to serve the Lord is to be considered completely liberated at present and in the future.</p>
<p>His going home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed.</p>
<p>He is above all materialistic criticism, just as Krsna is above all criticism.</p>

<p>I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone.</p>
<p>I am equal to all.</p>
<p>But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One may question here that if Krsna is equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural.</p>
<p>Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children.</p>
<p>The Lord claims that every living entity--in whatever form--is His son, and as such He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life.</p>
<p>He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless whether it falls on rock or land or water.</p>
<p>But for His devotees, He gives specific attention.</p>
<p>Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always in Krsna consciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated in Krsna.</p>
<p>The very phrase Krsna consciousness suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him.</p>
<p>The Lord says here distinctly, "mayi te," "in Me."</p>
<p>Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them.</p>
<p>This is reciprocal.</p>
<p>This also explains the words: asti na priyah ye bhajanti: "Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him."</p>
<p>This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious.</p>
<p>When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice.</p>
<p>The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified.</p>
<p>The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord, he looks like gold.</p>
<p>The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice.</p>
<p>Living entities in a pure state are called devotees.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees.</p>
<p>If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy.</p>
<p>In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is.</p>
<p>The example is often given that the Lord is like a desire tree, and whatever one wants from this desire tree, the Lord supplies.</p>
<p>But here the explanation is more complete.</p>
<p>The Lord is here stated to be partial to the devotees.</p>
<p>This is the manifestation of the Lord's special mercy to the devotees.</p>
<p>The Lord's reciprocation should not be considered to be under the law of karma.</p>
<p>It belongs to the transcendental situation in which the Lord and His devotees function.</p>
<p>Devotional service of the Lord is not an activity of this material world; it is part of the spiritual world where eternity, bliss and knowledge predominate.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service, he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word suduracaro used in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly.</p>
<p>When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional.</p>
<p>As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional.</p>
<p>Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged in Krsna consciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental.</p>
<p>Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service.</p>
<p>Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another.</p>
<p>But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another.</p>
<p>As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition.</p>
<p>He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person in Krsna consciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically.</p>
<p>But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that if a person falls down, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, beautifies him and excuses him from that abomination.</p>
<p>The material contamination is so strong that even a yogi fully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; but Krsna consciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified.</p>
<p>Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success.</p>
<p>No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as is explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Therefore a person who is situated in Krsna consciousness and is engaged with determination in the process of chanting Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare should be considered to be in the transcendental position, even if by chance or accident he is found to have fallen.</p>
<p>The words sadhur eva, "he is saintly," are very emphatic.</p>
<p>They are a warning to the nondevotees that because of an accidental falldown a devotee should not be derided; he should still be considered saintly even if he has fallen down accidentally.</p>
<p>And the word mantavyah is still more emphatic.</p>
<p>If one does not follow this rule, and derides a devotee for his accidental falldown, then he is disobeying the order of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The only qualification of a devotee is to be unflinchingly and exclusively engaged in devotional service.</p>
<p>The mark of a spot which may be seen on the moon does not become an impediment to the moonlight.</p>
<p>Similarly, the accidental falldown of a devotee from the path of a saintly character does not make him abominable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one should not misunderstand that a devotee in transcendental devotional service can act in all kinds of abominable ways; this verse only refers to an accident due to the strong power of material connections.</p>
<p>Devotional service is more or less a declaration of war against the illusory energy.</p>
<p>As long as one is not strong enough to fight the illusory energy, there may be accidental falldowns.</p>
<p>But when one is strong enough, he is no longer subjected to such falldowns, as previously explained.</p>
<p>No one should take advantage of this verse and commit nonsense and think that he is still a devotee.</p>
<p>If he does not improve in his character by devotional service, then it is to be understood that he is not a high devotee.</p>

<p>This should not be misunderstood.</p>
<p>In the Seventh Chapter the Lord says that one who is engaged in mischievous activities cannot become a devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever.</p>
<p>The question remains, then, how can a person engaged in abominable activities--either by accident or intention--be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised.</p>
<p>The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart.</p>
<p>He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away.</p>
<p>Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature.</p>
<p>According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position, he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself.</p>
<p>But here there is no such condition because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly.</p>
<p>Therefore, the chanting of Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare should be continued without stoppage.</p>
<p>This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns.</p>
<p>He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations.</p>

<p>It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there is no distinction between the lower or higher classes of people.</p>
<p>In the material conception of life, there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord, there are not.</p>
<p>Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that even the lowest, who are called candalas (dog-eaters), can be elevated by association with a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore devotional service and guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it.</p>
<p>The most simple man taking center of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance.</p>
<p>According to the different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (brahmanas), the mode of passion (ksatriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (vaisyas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (sudras, or workers).</p>
<p>Those lower than them are called candalas, and they are born in sinful families.</p>
<p>Generally, those who are born in sinful families are not accepted by the higher classes.</p>
<p>But the process of devotional service and the pure devotee of the Supreme God are so strong that all the lower classes can attain the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>This is possible only when one takes center of Krsna.</p>
<p>One has to take center completely of Krsna.</p>
<p>Then one can become much greater than great jnanis and yogis.</p>

<p>In this verse it is clearly indicated that Krsna consciousness is the only means of being delivered from the clutches of this contaminated material world.</p>
<p>Sometimes unscrupulous commentators distort the meaning of what is clearly stated here: that all devotional service should be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unscrupulous commentators divert the mind of the reader to that which is not at all feasible.</p>
<p>Such commentators do not know that there is no difference between Krsna's mind and Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna is not an ordinary human being; He is Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>His body, mind and He Himself are one and absolute.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Kurma Purana, as it is quoted by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami in his Anubhasya comments on Caitanya-caritamrta, Fifth Chapter, Adi-lila, verses 41-48, "deha-dehi-vibhedo 'yam nesvare vidyate kvacit," which means that there is no difference in Krsna, the Supreme Lord, between Himself and His body.</p>
<p>But, because they do not know this science of Krsna, the commentators hide Krsna and divide His personality from His mind or from His body.</p>
<p>Although this is sheer ignorance of the science of Krsna, some men make profit out of misleading the people.</p>
<p>There are some who are demonic; they also think of Krsna, but enviously, just like King Kamsa, Krsna's uncle.</p>
<p>He was also thinking of Krsna always, but he thought of Krsna as his enemy.</p>
<p>He was always in anxiety, wondering when Krsna would come to kill him.</p>
<p>That kind of thinking will not help us.</p>
<p>One should be thinking of Krsna in devotional love.</p>
<p>That is bhakti.</p>
<p>One should cultivate the knowledge of Krsna continually.</p>
<p>What is that favorable cultivation? It is to learn from a bona fide teacher.</p>
<p>Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we have several times explained that His body is not material, but is eternal, blissful knowledge.</p>
<p>This kind of talk about Krsna will help one become a devotee.</p>
<p>Otherwise, understanding Krsna from the wrong source will prove fruitless.</p>
<p>One should therefore engage his mind in the eternal form, the primal form of Krsna; with conviction in his heart that Krsna is the Supreme, he should engage himself in worship.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of temples in India for the worship of Krsna, and devotional service is practiced there.</p>
<p>When such practice is made, one has to offer obeisances to Krsna.</p>
<p>One should lower his head before the Deity and engage his mind, his body, his activities--everything.</p>
<p>That will make one fully absorbed in Krsna without deviation.</p>
<p>This will help one transfer into the Krsnaloka.</p>
<p>One should not be deviated by unscrupulous commentators.</p>
<p>One must engage in the nine different processes of devotional service, beginning with hearing and chanting about Krsna.</p>
<p>Pure devotional service is the highest achievement of human society.</p>
<p>In the Seventh and Eighth Chapters of Bhagavad-gita, pure devotional service to the Lord has been explained, apart from the yoga of knowledge and mystic yoga or fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Those who are not purely sanctified may be attracted by different features of the Lord, like the impersonal brahmajyoti and localized Paramatma, but a pure devotee directly takes to the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful poem about Krsna in which it is clearly stated that any person who is engaged in the worship of demigods is most unintelligent and cannot achieve at any time the supreme award of Krsna.</p>
<p>The devotee, in the beginning, may sometimes fall from the standard, but still he should be considered superior to all other philosophers and yogis.</p>
<p>One who always engages in Krsna consciousness should be understood to be the perfect saintly person.</p>
<p>His accidental nondevotional activities will diminish, and he will soon be situated without any doubt in complete perfection.</p>
<p>The pure devotee has no actual chance to fall down because the Supreme Godhead personally takes care of His pure devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore, the intelligent person should take directly to this process of Krsna consciousness and happily live in this material world.</p>
<p>He will eventually receive the supreme award of Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord said: My dear friend, mighty-armed Arjuna, listen again to My supreme word, which I shall impart to you for your benefit and which will give you great joy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word paramam is explained thus by Parasara Muni: one who is full in six opulences, who has full strength, full fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty and renunciation, is paramam, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>While Krsna was present on this earth, He displayed all six opulences.</p>
<p>Therefore great sages like Parasara Muni have all accepted Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Now Krsna is instructing Arjuna in more confidential knowledge of His opulences and His work.</p>
<p>Previously, beginning with the Seventh Chapter, the Lord already explained His different energies and how they are acting.</p>
<p>Now in this chapter He explains His specific opulences to Arjuna.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter he has clearly explained His different energies to establish devotion in firm conviction.</p>
<p>Again in this chapter He tells Arjuna about His manifestations and various opulences.</p>
<p>The more one hears about the Supreme God, the more one becomes fixed in devotional service.</p>
<p>One should always hear about the Lord in the association of devotees; that will enhance one's devotional service.</p>
<p>Discourses in the society of devotees can take place only among those who are really anxious to be in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Others cannot take part in such discourses.</p>
<p>The Lord clearly tells Arjuna that because he is very dear to Him, for his benefit such discourses are taking place.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Brahma-samhita, Lord Krsna is the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages.</p>
<p>Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand Krsna; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful activities.</p>
<p>One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand Krsna by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam also it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understand Krsna by such foolish speculation.</p>
<p>Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, "Here I am present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>I am the Supreme."</p>
<p>One should know this.</p>
<p>Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists.</p>
<p>We can actually understand Krsna, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position.</p>
<p>Because most men cannot understand Krsna in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators.</p>
<p>Yet despite the Supreme Lord's uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme.</p>
<p>Only the devotees who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord can understand, by the grace of the Supreme Personality, that He is Krsna.</p>
<p>The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God; their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Krsna, they can understand Krsna.</p>
<p>No one else can understand Him.</p>
<p>So even great sages agree: What is atma, what is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He who knows Me as the unborn, as the beginningless, as the Supreme Lord of all the worlds--he, undeluded among men, is freed from all sins.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Seventh Chapter, those who are trying to elevate themselves to the platform of spiritual realization are not ordinary men.</p>
<p>They are superior to millions and millions of ordinary men who have no knowledge of spiritual realization, but out of those actually trying to understand their spiritual situation, one who can come to the understanding that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the proprietor of everything, the unborn, is the most successful spiritually realized person.</p>
<p>In that stage only, when one has fully understood Krsna's supreme position, can one be free completely from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Here the word ajam, meaning unborn, should not be confused with the living entities, who are described in the Second Chapter as ajam.</p>
<p>The Lord is different from the living entities who are taking birth and dying due to material attachment.</p>
<p>The conditional souls are changing their bodies, but His body is not changeable.</p>
<p>Even when He comes to this material world, He comes as the same unborn; therefore in the Fourth Chapter it is said that the Lord, by His internal potency, is not under the inferior material energy, but is always in the superior energy.</p>
<p>He was existing before the creation, and He is different from His creation.</p>
<p>All the demigods were created within this material world, but as far as Krsna is concerned, it is said that He is not created; therefore Krsna is different even from the great demigods like Brahma and Siva.</p>
<p>And because He is the creator of Brahma, Siva and all the other demigods, He is the Supreme Person of all planets.</p>
<p>Sri Krsna is therefore different from everything that is created, and anyone who knows Him as such immediately becomes liberated from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>One must be liberated from all sinful activities to be in the knowledge of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Only by devotional service can He be known and not by any other means, as stated in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One should not try to understand Krsna as a human being.</p>
<p>As stated previously, only a foolish person thinks Him to be a human being.</p>
<p>This is again expressed here in a different way.</p>
<p>A man who is not foolish, who is intelligent enough to understand the constitutional position of the Godhead, is always free from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>If Krsna is known as the son of Devaki, then how can He be unborn? That is also explained in Srimad-Bhagavatam: When He appeared before Devaki and Vasudeva, He was not born as an ordinary child; He appeared in His original form, and then He transformed Himself into an ordinary child.</p>
<p>Anything done under the direction of Krsna is transcendental.</p>
<p>It cannot be contaminated by the material reactions, which may be auspicious or inauspicious.</p>
<p>The conception that there are things auspicious and inauspicious in the material world is more or less a mental concoction because there is nothing auspicious in the material world.</p>
<p>Everything is inauspicious because the very material mask is inauspicious.</p>
<p>We simply imagine it to be auspicious.</p>
<p>Real auspiciousness depends on activities in Krsna consciousness in full devotion and service.</p>
<p>Therefore if we at all want our activities to he auspicious, then we should work under the directions of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Such directions are given in authoritative scriptures such as Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita, or from a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Because the spiritual master is the representative of the Supreme Lord, his direction is directly the direction of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The spiritual master, saintly persons and scriptures direct in the same way.</p>
<p>There is no contradiction in these three sources.</p>
<p>All actions done under such direction are free from the reactions of pious or impious activities of this material world.</p>
<p>The transcendental attitude of the devotee in the performance of activities is actually that of renunciation, and this is called sannyasa.</p>
<p>Anyone acting under the direction of the Supreme Lord is actually a sannyasi and a yogi, and not the man who has simply taken the dress of the sannyasi, or a pseudo-yogi.</p>

<p>Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from doubt and delusion, forgiveness, truthfulness, self-control and calmness, pleasure and pain, birth, death, fear, fearlessness, nonviolence, equanimity, satisfaction, austerity, charity, fame and infamy are created by Me alone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The different qualities of living entities, be they good or bad, are all created by Krsna, and they are described here.</p>
<p>Intelligence refers to the power of analyzing things in proper perspective, and knowledge refers to understanding what is spirit and what is matter.</p>
<p>Ordinary knowledge obtained by a university education pertains only to matter, and it is not accepted here as knowledge.</p>
<p>Knowledge means knowing the distinction between spirit and matter.</p>
<p>In modern education there is no knowledge about the spirit; they are simply taking care of the material elements and bodily needs.</p>
<p>Therefore academic knowledge is not complete.</p>
<p>Asammohah, freedom from doubt and delusion, can be achieved when one is not hesitant and when he understands the transcendental philosophy.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely he becomes free from bewilderment.</p>
<p>Nothing should be accepted blindly; everything should be accepted with care and with caution.</p>
<p>Ksama, forgiveness, should be practiced, and one should excuse the minor offenses of others.</p>
<p>Satyam, truthfulness, means that facts should be presented as they are for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>Facts should not be misrepresented.</p>
<p>According to social conventions, it is said that one can speak the truth only when it is palatable to others.</p>
<p>But that is not truthfulness.</p>
<p>The truth should be spoken in a straight and forward way, so that others will understand actually what the facts are.</p>
<p>If a man is a thief and if people are warned that he is a thief, that is truth.</p>
<p>Although sometimes the truth is unpalatable, one should not refrain from speaking it.</p>
<p>Truthfulness demands that the facts be presented as they are for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>That is the definition of truth.</p>
<p>Self-control means that the senses should not be used for unnecessary personal enjoyment.</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against meeting the proper needs of the senses, but unnecessary sense enjoyment is detrimental for spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Therefore the senses should be restrained from unnecessary use.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mind should not indulge in unnecessary thoughts; that is called samah, or calmness.</p>
<p>Nor should one spend one's time pondering over earning money.</p>
<p>That is a misuse of the thinking power.</p>
<p>The mind should be used to understand the prime necessity of human beings, and that should be presented authoritatively.</p>
<p>The power of thought should be developed in association with persons who are authorities in the scriptures, saintly persons and spiritual masters and those whose thinking is highly developed.</p>
<p>Sukham, pleasure or happiness, should always be in that which is favorable for the cultivation of the spiritual knowledge of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>And similarly, that which is painful or which causes distress is that which is unfavorable for the cultivation of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Anything favorable for the development of Krsna consciousness should be accepted, and anything unfavorable should be rejected.</p>
<p>Bhava, birth, should be understood to refer to the body.</p>
<p>As far as the soul is concerned, there is neither birth nor death; that we have discussed in the beginning of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Birth and death apply to one's embodiment in the material world.</p>
<p>Fear is due to worrying about the future.</p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness has no fear because by his activities he is sure to go back to the spiritual sky, back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore his future is very bright.</p>
<p>Others, however, do not know what their future holds; they have no knowledge of what the next life holds.</p>
<p>So they are therefore in constant anxiety.</p>
<p>If we want to get free from anxiety, then the best course is to understand Krsna and be situated always in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>In that way we will be free from all fear.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is stated that fear is caused by our absorption in the illusory energy, but those who are free from the illusory energy, those who are confident that they are not the material body, that they are spiritual parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are therefore engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Godhead, have nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Their future is very bright.</p>
<p>This fear is a condition of persons who are not in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Bhayam, fearlessness, is only possible for one in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Ahimsa, nonviolence, means that one should not do anything which will put others into misery or confusion.</p>
<p>Material activities that are promised by so many politicians, sociologists, philanthropists, etc., do not produce very good results because the politicians and philanthropists have no transcendental vision; they do not know what is actually beneficial for human society.</p>
<p>Ahimsa means that people should be trained in such a way that the full utilization of the human body can be achieved.</p>
<p>The human body is meant for spiritual realization, so any movement or any commissions which do not further that end commit violence on the human body.</p>
<p>That which furthers the future spiritual happiness of the people in general is called nonviolence.</p>
<p>Samata, equanimity, refers to freedom from attachment and aversion.</p>
<p>To be very much attached or to be very much detached is not the best.</p>
<p>This material world should be accepted without attachment or aversion.</p>
<p>Similarly, that which is favorable for prosecuting Krsna consciousness should be accepted; that which is unfavorable should be rejected.</p>
<p>That is called samata, equanimity.</p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness has nothing to reject and nothing to accept unless it is useful in the prosecution of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Tustih, satisfaction, means that one should not be eager to gather more and more material goods by unnecessary activity.</p>
<p>One should be satisfied with whatever is obtained by the grace of the Supreme Lord; that is called satisfaction.</p>
<p>Tapas means austerity or penance.</p>
<p>There are many rules and definitions in the Vedas which apply here, like rising early in the morning and taking a bath.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is very troublesome to rise early in the morning, but whatever voluntary trouble one may suffer in this way is called penance.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are prescriptions for fasting on certain days of the month.</p>
<p>One may not be inclined to practice such fasting, but because of his determination to make advancement in the science of Krsna consciousness, he should accept such bodily troubles which are recommended.</p>
<p>However, one should not fast unnecessarily or against Vedic injunctions.</p>
<p>One should not fast for some political purpose; that is described in Bhagavad-gita as fasting in ignorance, and anything done in ignorance or passion does not lead to spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Everything done in the mode of goodness does advance one, however, and fasting done in terms of the Vedic injunctions enriches one in spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>As far as charity is concerned, one should give fifty percent of his earnings to some good cause.</p>
<p>And what is a good cause? It is that which is conducted in terms of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That is not only a good cause, but it is the best cause.</p>
<p>Because Krsna is good, His cause is also good.</p>
<p>Thus charity should be given to a person who is engaged in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>According to Vedic literature, it is enjoined that charity should be given to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>This practice is still followed, although not very nicely in terms of the Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>But still the injunction is that charity should be given to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Why? Because they are engaged in higher cultivation of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>A brahmana is supposed to devote his whole life to understanding Brahman.</p>
<p>A brahma-jana is one who knows Brahman; he is called a brahmana.</p>
<p>Thus charity is offered to the brahmanas because since they are always engaged in higher spiritual service, they have no time to earn their livelihood.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature, charity is also to be awarded to the renouncer of life, the sannyasi.</p>
<p>The sannyasis beg from door to door, not for money but for missionary purposes.</p>
<p>The system is that they go from door to door to awaken the householders from the slumber of ignorance.</p>
<p>Because the householders are engaged in family affairs and have forgotten their actual purpose in life--awakening their Krsna consciousness--it is the business of the sannyasis to go as beggars to the householders and encourage them to be Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>As it is said in the Vedas, one should awake and achieve what is due him in this human form of life.</p>
<p>This knowledge and method is distributed by the sannyasis; hence charity is to be given to the renouncer of life, to the brahmanas, and similar good causes, not to any whimsical cause.</p>
<p>Yasah, fame, should be according to Lord Caitanya, who said that a man is famous when he is known as a great devotee.</p>
<p>That is real fame.</p>
<p>If one has become a great man in Krsna consciousness and it is known, then he is truly famous.</p>
<p>One who does not have such fame is infamous.</p>
<p>All these qualities are manifest throughout the universe in human society and in the society of the demigods.</p>
<p>There are many forms of humanity on other planets, and these qualities are there.</p>
<p>Now, for one who wants to advance in Krsna consciousness, Krsna creates all these qualities, but the person develops them himself from within.</p>
<p>One who engages in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord develops all the good qualities, as arranged by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Of whatever we find, good or bad, the origin is Krsna.</p>
<p>Nothing can manifest in this material world which is not in Krsna.</p>
<p>That is knowledge; although we know that things are differently situated, we should realize that everything flows from Krsna.</p>

<p>Brahma underwent penance for one thousand years of the demigods before he realized by the grace of Krsna how to create.</p>
<p>Then from Brahma, Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara came out, then Rudra, and then the seven sages, and in this way all the brahmanas and ksatriyas are born out of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Brahma is known as pitamaha, the grandfather, and Krsna is known as the prapita-maha, the father of the grandfather.</p>

<p>The highest summit of spiritual perfection is knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Unless one is firmly convinced of the different opulences of the Supreme Lord, he cannot engage in devotional service.</p>
<p>Generally people know that God is great, but they do not know in detail how God is great.</p>
<p>Here are the details.</p>
<p>If one knows factually how God is great, then naturally he becomes a surrendered soul and engages himself in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>When one factually knows the opulences of the Supreme, there is no alternative but to surrender to Him.</p>
<p>This factual knowledge can be known from the descriptions in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita and similar literatures.</p>
<p>In the administration of this universe there are many demigods distributed throughout the planetary system, and the chief of them are Brahma, Lord Siva and the four great Kumaras and other patriarchs.</p>
<p>There are many forefathers of the population of the universe, and all of them are born of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the original forefather of all forefathers.</p>
<p>These are some of the opulences of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When one is firmly convinced of them, he accepts Krsna with great faith and without any doubt, and he engages in devotional service.</p>
<p>All this particular knowledge is required in order to increase one's interest in the loving devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>One should not neglect to understand fully how great Krsna is, for by knowing the greatness of Krsna one will be able to be fixed in sincere devotional service.</p>

<p>The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A learned scholar who has studied the Vedas perfectly and has information from authorities like Lord Caitanya and who knows how to apply these teachings can understand that Krsna is the origin of everything in both the material and spiritual worlds, and because he knows this perfectly he becomes firmly fixed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He can never be deviated by any amount of nonsensical commentaries or by fools.</p>
<p>All Vedic literature agrees that Krsna is the source of Brahma, Siva and all other demigods.</p>
<p>In the Atharva-veda it is said, "yo brahmanam vidadhati: purvam yo vai vedams ca gapayati sma krsnah."</p>
<p>"It was Krsna who in the beginning instructed Brahma in Vedic knowledge and who disseminated Vedic knowledge in the past."</p>
<p>Then again it is said, "atha puruso ha vai narayano 'kamayata prajah srjeya ity upakramya."</p>
<p>"Then the Supreme Personality Narayana desired to create living entities."</p>
<p>Again it is said:</p>
<p>narayanad brahma jayate, narayanad prajapatih prajayate, narayanad indro jayate, narayanad astau vasavo jayante, narayanad ekadasa rudra jayante, narayanad dvadasadityah.</p>
<p>"From Narayana, Brahma is born, and from Narayana, the patriarchs are also born.</p>
<p>From Narayana, Indra is born, from Narayana the eight Vasus are born, from Narayana the eleven Rudras are born, from Narayana the twelve Adityas are born."</p>
<p>It is said in the same Vedas: brahmanyo devaki-putrah: "The son of Devaki, Krsna, is the Supreme Personality."</p>
<p>Then it is said:</p>
<p>eko vai narayana asin na brahma na isano napo nagni samau neme dyav-aprthivi na naksatrani na suryah sa ekaki na ramate tasya dhyanantah sthasya yatra chandogaih kriyamanastakadi-samjnaka stuti-stomah stomam ucyate.</p>
<p>"In the beginning of the creation there was only the Supreme Personality Narayana.</p>
<p>There was no Brahma, no Siva, no fire, no moon, no stars in the sky, no sun.</p>
<p>There was only Krsna, who creates all and enjoys all."</p>
<p>In the many Puranas it is said that Lord Siva was born from the highest, the Supreme Lord Krsna, and the Vedas say that it is the Supreme Lord, the creator of Brahma and Siva, who is to be worshiped.</p>
<p>In the Moksa-dharma Krsna also says, prajapatim ca rudram capy aham eva srjami vai tau hi mam na vijanito mama maya-vimohitau.</p>
<p>"The patriarchs, Siva and others are created by Me, though they do not know that they are created by Me because they are deluded by My illusory energy."</p>
<p>In Varaha Purana it is also said, narayanah paro devas tasmaj jatas caturmukhah tasmad rudro 'bhavad devah sa ca sarvajnatam gatah.</p>
<p>"Narayana is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and from Him Brahma was born, from whom Siva was born."</p>
<p>Lord Krsna is the source of all generations, and He is called the most efficient cause of everything.</p>
<p>He says that because "everything is born of Me, I am the original source of all.</p>
<p>Everything is under Me; no one is above Me."</p>
<p>There is no supreme controller other than Krsna.</p>
<p>One who understands Krsna in such a way from a bona fide spiritual master and from Vedic literature, who engages all his energy in Krsna consciousness, becomes a truly learned man.</p>
<p>In comparison to him, all others, who do not know Krsna properly, are but fools.</p>
<p>Only a fool would consider Krsna to be an ordinary man.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person should not be bewildered by fools; he should avoid all unauthorized commentaries and interpretations on Bhagavad-gita and proceed in Krsna consciousness with determination and firmness.</p>

<p>The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and conversing about Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Pure devotees, whose characteristics are mentioned here, engage themselves fully in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Their minds cannot be diverted from the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p>Their talks are solely on the transcendental subjects.</p>
<p>The symptoms of the pure devotees are described in this verse specifically.</p>
<p>Devotees of the Supreme Lord are twenty-four hours daily engaged in glorifying the pastimes of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Their hearts and souls are constantly submerged in Krsna, and they take pleasure in discussing Him with other devotees.</p>
<p>In the preliminary stage of devotional service they relish the transcendental pleasure from the service itself, and in the mature stage they are actually situated in love of God.</p>
<p>Once situated in that transcendental position, they can relish the highest perfection which is exhibited by the Lord in His abode.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya likens transcendental devotional service to the sowing of a seed in the heart of the living entity.</p>
<p>There are innumerable living entities traveling throughout the different planets of the universe, and out of them there are a few who are fortunate enough to meet a pure devotee and get the chance to understand devotional service.</p>
<p>This devotional service is just like a seed, and if it is sown in the heart of a living entity, and if he goes on hearing and chanting, Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare that seed fructifies, just as the seed of a tree fructifies with regular watering.</p>
<p>The spiritual plant of devotional service gradually grows and grows until it penetrates the covering of the material universe and enters into the brahmajyoti effulgence in the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>In the spiritual sky also that plant grows more and more until it reaches the highest planet, which is called Goloka Vrndavana, the supreme planet of Krsna.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of Krsna and rests there.</p>
<p>Gradually, as a plant grows fruits and flowers, that plant of devotional service also produces fruits, and the watering process in the form of chanting and hearing goes on.</p>
<p>This plant of devotional service is fully described in the Caitanya-caritamrta.</p>
<p>It is explained there that when the complete plant takes shelter under the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, one becomes fully absorbed in love of God; then he cannot live even for a moment without being in contact with the Supreme Lord, just as a fish cannot live without water.</p>
<p>In such a state, the devotee actually attains the transcendental qualities in contact with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam is also full of such narration about the relationship between the Supreme Lord and His devotees; therefore the Srimad-Bhagavatam is very dear to the devotees.</p>
<p>In this narration there is nothing about material activities, sense gratification or liberation.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is the only narration in which the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord and His devotees is fully described.</p>
<p>Thus the realized souls in Krsna consciousness take continual pleasure in hearing such transcendental literatures, just as a young boy and girl take pleasure in association.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the word buddhi-yogam is very significant.</p>
<p>We may remember that in the Second Chapter the Lord, instructing Arjuna, said that He had spoken to him of many things and that He would instruct him in the way of buddhi-yoga.</p>
<p>Now buddhi-yoga is explained.</p>
<p>Buddhi-yogam itself is action in Krsna consciousness; that is the highest intelligence.</p>
<p>Buddhi means intelligence, and yogam means mystic activities or mystic elevation.</p>
<p>When one tries to go back home, back to Godhead, and takes fully to Krsna consciousness in devotional service, his action is called buddhi-yogam.</p>
<p>In other words, buddhi-yogam is the process by which one gets out of the entanglement of this material world.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of progress is Krsna.</p>
<p>People do not know this; therefore the association of devotees and a bona fide spiritual master are important.</p>
<p>One should know that the goal is Krsna, and when the goal is assigned, then the path is slowly but progressively traversed, and the ultimate goal is achieved.</p>
<p>When a person knows the goal of life but is addicted to the fruits of activities, he is acting in karma-yoga.</p>
<p>When he knows that the goal is Krsna, but he takes pleasure in mental speculations to understand Krsna, he is acting in jnana-yoga.</p>
<p>And when he knows the goal and seeks Krsna completely in Krsna consciousness and devotional service, he is acting in bhakti-yoga, or buddhi-yoga, which is the complete yoga.</p>
<p>This complete yoga is the highest perfectional stage of life.</p>
<p>A person may have a bona fide spiritual master and may be attached to a spiritual organization, but still, if he is not intelligent enough to make progress, then Krsna from within gives him instructions so that he may ultimately come to Him without difficulty.</p>
<p>The qualification is that a person always engage himself in Krsna consciousness and with love and devotion render all kinds of services.</p>
<p>He should perform some sort of work for Krsna, and that work should be with love.</p>
<p>If a devotee is intelligent enough, he will make progress on the path of self-realization.</p>
<p>If one is sincere and devoted to the activities of devotional service, the Lord gives him a chance to make progress and ultimately attain to Him.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Lord Caitanya was in Benares promulgating the chanting of Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare thousands of people were following Him.</p>
<p>Prakasananda, a very influential and learned scholar in Benares at that time, derided Lord Caitanya for being a sentimentalist.</p>
<p>Sometimes philosophers criticize the devotees because they think that most of the devotees are in the darkness of ignorance and are philosophically naive sentimentalists.</p>
<p>Actually that is not the fact.</p>
<p>There are very, very learned scholars who have put forward the philosophy of devotion, but even if a devotee does not take advantage of their literatures or of his spiritual master, if he is sincere in his devotional service he is helped by Krsna Himself within his heart.</p>
<p>So the sincere devotee engaged in Krsna consciousness cannot be without knowledge.</p>
<p>The only qualification is that one carry out devotional service in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The modern philosophers think that without discriminating one cannot have pure knowledge.</p>
<p>For them this answer is given by the Supreme Lord: those who are engaged in pure devotional service, even though they be without sufficient education and even without sufficient knowledge of the Vedic principles, are still helped by the Supreme God, as stated in this verse.</p>
<p>The Lord tells Arjuna that basically there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, simply by speculating, for the Supreme Truth is so great that it is not possible to understand Him or to achieve Him simply by making a mental effort.</p>
<p>Man can go on speculating for several millions of years, and if he is not devoted, if he is not a lover of the Supreme Truth, he will never understand Krsna or the Supreme Truth.</p>
<p>Only by devotional service is the Supreme Truth, Krsna, pleased, and by His inconceivable energy He can reveal Himself to the heart of the pure devotee.</p>
<p>The pure devotee always has Krsna within his heart; therefore he is just like the sun that dissipates the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>This is the special mercy rendered to the pure devotee by Krsna.</p>
<p>Due to the contamination of material association, through many, many millions of births, one's heart is always covered with the dust of materialism, but when one engages in devotional service and constantly chants Hare Krsna, the dust quickly clears, and one is elevated to the platform of pure knowledge.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Visnu can be attained only by this chant and by devotional service, and not by mental speculation or argument.</p>
<p>The pure devotee does not have to worry about the necessities of life; he need not be anxious because when he removes the darkness from his heart, everything is provided automatically by the Supreme Lord, for He is pleased by the loving devotional service of the devotee.</p>
<p>This is the essence of the Gita's teachings.</p>
<p>By studying Bhagavad-gita, one can become a completely surrendered soul to the Supreme Lord and engage himself in pure devotional service.</p>
<p>As the Lord takes charge, one becomes completely free from all kinds of materialistic endeavors.</p>

<p>Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person.</p>
<p>You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading beauty.</p>
<p>All the great sages such as Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In these two verses the Supreme Lord gives a chance to the modern philosopher, for here it is clear that the Supreme is different from the individual soul.</p>
<p>Arjuna, after hearing the essential four verses of Bhagavad-gita in this chapter, became completely free from all doubts and accepted Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He at once boldly declares, "You are Parambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</p>
<p>And previously Krsna states that He is the originator of everything and everyone.</p>
<p>Every demigod and every human being is dependant on Him.</p>
<p>Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independant of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service.</p>
<p>This is already explained in the previous verse by the Lord.</p>
<p>Now by His grace, Arjuna is accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>It is not because Krsna is an intimate friend of Arjuna that he is flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Whatever Arjuna says in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth.</p>
<p>Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot.</p>
<p>Each and every word of this verse spoken by Arjuna is confirmed by Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>In the Kena Upanisad it is stated that the Supreme Brahman is the rest for everything, and Krsna has already explained that everything is resting on Him.</p>
<p>The Mundaka Upanisad confirms that the Supreme Lord, in whom everything is resting, can be realized only by those who engage constantly in thinking of Him.</p>
<p>This constant thinking of Krsna is smaranam, one of the methods of devotional service.</p>
<p>It is only by devotional service to Krsna that one can understand his position and get rid of this material body.</p>
<p>In the Vedas the Supreme Lord is accepted as the purest of the pure.</p>
<p>One who understands that Krsna is the purest of the pure can become purified from all sinful activities.</p>
<p>One cannot be disinfected from sinful activities unless he surrenders unto the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Arjuna's acceptance of Krsna as the supreme pure complies with the injunctions of Vedic literature.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed by great personalities, of whom Narada is the chief.</p>
<p>Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and one should always meditate upon Him and enjoy one's transcendental relationship with Him.</p>
<p>He is the supreme existence.</p>
<p>He is free from bodily needs, birth and death.</p>
<p>Not only does Arjuna confirm this, but all the Vedic literatures, the Puranas and histories.</p>
<p>In all Vedic literatures Krsna is thus described, and the Supreme Lord Himself also says in the Fourth Chapter, "Although I am unborn, I appear on this earth to establish religious principles."</p>
<p>He is the supreme origin; He has no cause, for He is the cause of all causes, and everything is emanating from Him.</p>
<p>This perfect knowledge can be had by the grace of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Here Arjuna expresses himself through the grace of Krsna.</p>
<p>If we want to understand Bhagavad-gita, we should accept the statements in these two verses.</p>
<p>This is called the parampara system, acceptance of the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Unless one is in the disciplic succession, he cannot understand Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>It is not possible by so-called academic education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately those proud of their academic education, despite so much evidence in Vedic literatures, stick to their obstinate conviction that Krsna is an ordinary person.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna herein confirms that persons of faithless and demonic nature cannot understand Krsna.</p>
<p>He is not even known by the demigods, so what to speak of the so-called scholars of this modern world? By the grace of the Supreme Lord, Arjuna has understood that the Supreme Truth is Krsna and that He is the perfect one.</p>
<p>One should therefore follow the path of Arjuna.</p>
<p>He received the authority of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>As described in the Fourth Chapter, the parampara system of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-gita was lost, and therefore Krsna reestablished that disciplic succession with Arjuna because He considered Arjuna His intimate friend and a great devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gitopanisad, Bhagavad-gita should be understood in the parampara system.</p>
<p>When the parampara system was lost, Arjuna was again selected to rejuvenate it.</p>
<p>The acceptance of Arjuna of all that Krsna says should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gita, and then only can we understand that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>Indeed, You alone know Yourself by Your own potencies, O origin of all, Lord of all beings, God of gods, O Supreme Person, Lord of the universe!</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Krsna can be known by persons who are in a relationship with Him through the discharge of devotional service, like Arjuna and his successors.</p>
<p>Persons of demonic or atheistic mentality cannot know Krsna.</p>
<p>Mental speculation that leads one away from the Supreme Lord is a serious sin, and one who does not know Krsna should not try to comment on Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita is the statement of Krsna, and since it is the science of Krsna, it should be understood from Krsna as Arjuna understood it.</p>
<p>It should not be received from atheistic persons.</p>
<p>The Supreme Truth is realized in three aspects: as impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma and at last as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>So at the last stage of understanding the Absolute Truth, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>A liberated man and even a common man may realize impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma, yet they may not understand God's personality from the verses of Bhagavad-gita, which are being spoken by this person, Krsna.</p>
<p>Sometimes the impersonalists accept Krsna as Bhagavan, or they accept His authority.</p>
<p>Yet many liberated persons cannot understand Krsna as Purusottama, the Supreme Person, the father of all living entities.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna addresses Him as Purusottama.</p>
<p>And if one comes to know Him as the father of all the living entities, still one may not know Him as the supreme controller; therefore He is addressed here as Bhutesa, the supreme controller of everyone.</p>
<p>And even if one knows Krsna as the supreme controller of all living entities, still one may not know that He is the origin of all the demigods; therefore He is addressed herein as Devadeva, the worshipful God of all demigods.</p>
<p>And even if one knows Him as the worshipful God of all demigods, one may not know that He is the supreme proprietor of everything; therefore He is addressed as Jagatpati.</p>
<p>Thus the truth about Krsna is established in this verse by the realization of Arjuna, and we should follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Krsna as He is.</p>

<p>For him there is no doubt, Yet he is asking Krsna to explain His all-pervading nature so that in the future people will understand, especially the impersonalists, how He exists in His all-pervading aspect through His different energies.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by His yoga-maya.</p>
<p>Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him.</p>
<p>Now Arjuna is convinced that His friend, Krsna, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man.</p>
<p>No common man, including the demons and atheists, can know Krsna because He is guarded by His yoga-maya energy.</p>
<p>Again, these questions are asked by Arjuna for their benefit.</p>
<p>The superior devotee is not only concerned for his own understanding, but for the understanding of all mankind.</p>
<p>Out of his mercy, because he is a Vaisnava, a devotee, Arjuna is opening the understanding for the common man as far as the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme is concerned.</p>
<p>He addresses Krsna specifically as yogin because Sri Krsna is the master of the yoga-maya energy by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man.</p>
<p>The common man who has no love for Krsna cannot always think of Krsna; therefore he has to think materially.</p>
<p>Arjuna is considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world.</p>
<p>Because materialists cannot understand Krsna spiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see how Krsna is manifested by physical representations.</p>

<p>"One can never be satiated even though one continuously hears the transcendental pastimes of Krsna, who is glorified by Vedic hymns.</p>
<p>Those who have entered into a transcendental relationship with Krsna relish in every step descriptions of the pastimes of the Lord."</p>
<p>Thus Arjuna is interested to hear about Krsna, specifically how He remains as the all-pervading Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Now as far as amrtam, nectar, is concerned, any narration or statement concerning Krsna is just like nectar.</p>
<p>And this nectar can be perceived by practical experience.</p>
<p>Modern stories, fiction and histories are different from the transcendental pastimes of the Lord in that one will tire of hearing mundane stories, but one never tires of hearing about Krsna.</p>
<p>It is for this reason only that the history of the whole universe is replete with references to the pastimes of the incarnations of Godhead.</p>
<p>For instance, the Puranas are histories of bygone ages that relate the pastimes of the various incarnations of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this way the reading matter remains forever fresh, despite repeated readings.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: Yes, I will tell you of My splendorous manifestations, but only of those which are prominent, O Arjuna, for My opulence is limitless.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is not possible to comprehend the greatness of Krsna and His opulences.</p>
<p>The senses of the individual soul are imperfect and do not permit him to understand the totality of Krsna's affairs.</p>
<p>Still the devotees try to understand Krsna, but not on the principle that they will be able to understand Krsna fully at any specific time or in any state of life.</p>
<p>Rather, the very topics of Krsna are so relishable that they appear to them as nectar.</p>
<p>Thus they enjoy them.</p>
<p>In discussing Krsna's opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure.</p>
<p>Therefore they want to hear and discuss them.</p>
<p>Krsna knows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies.</p>
<p>The word pradhanyatah (principal) is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited.</p>
<p>It is not possible to understand them all.</p>
<p>And vibhuti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation.</p>
<p>In the Amara-kosa dictionary it is stated that vibhuti indicates an exceptional opulence.</p>
<p>The impersonalist or the pantheist cannot understand the exceptional opulences of the Supreme Lord nor the manifestations of His divine energy.</p>
<p>Both in the material world and in the spiritual world His energies are distributed in every variety of manifestation.</p>
<p>Now Krsna is describing what can be directly perceived by the common man; thus part of His variegated energy is described in this way.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I am the Self, O Gudakesa, seated in the hearts of all creatures.</p>
<p>I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse Arjuna is addressed as Gudakesa, which means one who has conquered the darkness of sleep.</p>
<p>For those who are sleeping in the darkness of ignorance, it is not possible to understand how the Supreme Godhead manifests Himself in the material and spiritual worlds.</p>
<p>Thus this address by Krsna to Arjuna is significant.</p>
<p>Because Arjuna is above such darkness, the Personality of Godhead agrees to describe His various opulences.</p>
<p>Krsna first informs Arjuna that He is the Self or soul of the entire cosmic manifestation by dint of His primary expansion.</p>
<p>Before the material creation, the Supreme Lord, by His plenary expansion, accepts the Purusa incarnations, and from Him everything begins.</p>
<p>Therefore He is atma, the soul of the mahat-tattva, the universal elements.</p>
<p>The total material energy is not the cause of the creation, but actually the Maha-Visnu enters into the mahat-tattva, the total material energy.</p>
<p>He is the soul.</p>
<p>When Maha-Visnu enters into the manifested universes, He again manifests Himself as the Supersoul in each and every entity.</p>
<p>We have experience that the personal body of the living entity exists due to the presence of the spiritual spark.</p>
<p>Without the existence of the spiritual spark, the body cannot develop.</p>
<p>Similarly, the material manifestation cannot develop unless the Supreme Soul of Krsna enters.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is existing as the Supersoul in all manifested universes.</p>
<p>A description of the three purusa-avataras is given in Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>"The Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests three features, as Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu, in this material manifestation."</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Krsna, the cause of all causes, lies down in the cosmic ocean as Maha-Visnu or Karanodakasayi Visnu, and therefore Krsna is the beginning of this universe, the maintainer of the universal manifestation, and the end of all the energy.</p>

<p>There are twelve Adityas, of which Krsna is the principal.</p>
<p>And among all the luminaries twinkling in the sky, the sun is the chief, and in the Brahma-samhita the sun is accepted as the glowing effulgence of the Supreme Lord and is considered to be one of His eyes.</p>
<p>Marici is the controlling deity of the heavenly spaces.</p>
<p>Among the stars, the moon is most prominent at night, and thus the moon represents Krsna.</p>

<p>Brahma, the first living creature within the universe, created several sons for the propagation of various kinds of species.</p>
<p>The most powerful of his sons is Bhrgu, who is also the greatest sage.</p>

<p>masanam marga-sirso 'ham</p>
<p>rtunam kusumakarah</p>
<p>brhat-sama--the Brhat-sama; tatha--also; samnam--of the Sama-veda song; gayatri--the Gayatri hymns; chandasam--of all poetry; aham--I am; masanam--of months; marga-sirso 'ham--the month of November-December; aham--I am; rtunam--of all seasons; kusumakarah--spring.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Of hymns I am the Brhat-sama sung to the Lord Indra, and of poetry I am the Gayatri verse, sung daily by brahmanas.</p>
<p>Of months I am November and December, and of seasons I am flower-bearing spring.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It has already been explained by the Lord that amongst all the Vedas, the Sama-veda is rich with beautiful songs played by the various demigods.</p>
<p>One of these songs is the Brhat-sama, which has an exquisite melody and is sung at midnight.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit, there are definite rules that regulate poetry; rhyme and meter are not written whimsically, as in much modern poetry.</p>
<p>Amongst the regulated poetry, the Gayatri mantra, which is chanted by the duly qualified brahmanas, is the most prominent.</p>
<p>The Gayatri mantra is mentioned in the Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Because the Gayatri mantra is especially meant for God realization, it represents the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This mantra is meant for spiritually advanced people, and when one attains success in chanting it, he can enter into the transcendental position of the Lord.</p>
<p>One must first acquire the qualities of the perfectly situated person, the qualities of goodness according to the laws of material nature, in order to chant the Gayatri mantra.</p>
<p>The Gayatri mantra is very important in Vedic civilization and is considered to be the sound incarnation of Brahman.</p>
<p>Brahma is its initiator, and it is passed down from him in disciplic succession.</p>
<p>The months of November and December are considered the best of all months because in India grains are collected from the fields at this time, and the people become very happy.</p>
<p>Of course spring is a season universally liked because it is neither too hot nor too cold, and the flowers and trees blossom and flourish.</p>
<p>In spring there are also many ceremonies commemorating Krsna's pastimes; therefore this is considered to be the most joyful of all seasons, and it is the representative of the Supreme Lord Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many kinds of cheaters all over the universe.</p>
<p>Of all cheating processes, gambling stands supreme and therefore represents Krsna.</p>
<p>As the Supreme, Krsna can be more deceitful than any mere man.</p>
<p>If Krsna chooses to deceive a person, no one can surpass Him in His deceit.</p>
<p>His greatness is not simply one-sided--it is all-sided.</p>
<p>Among the victorious, He is victory.</p>
<p>He is the splendor of the splendid.</p>
<p>Among enterprising industrialists, He is the most enterprising.</p>
<p>Among adventurers, He is the most adventurous, and among the strong, He is the strongest.</p>
<p>When Krsna was present on earth, no one could surpass Him in strength.</p>
<p>Even in His childhood He lifted Govardhana Hill.</p>
<p>No one can surpass Him in cheating, no one can surpass Him in splendor, no one can surpass Him in victory, no one can surpass Him in enterprise, and no one can surpass Him in strength.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vasudeva is the immediate expansion of Krsna.</p>
<p>Both Lord Krsna and Baladeva appear as the sons of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Amongst the sons of Pandu, Arjuna is famous and valiant.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is the best of men and therefore represents Krsna.</p>
<p>Among the munis, or learned men conversant in Vedic knowledge, Vyasa is the greatest because he explained Vedic knowledge in many different ways for the understanding of the common mass of people in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>And Vyasa is also known as an incarnation of Krsna; therefore Vyasa also represents Krsna.</p>
<p>Kavis are those who are capable of thinking thoroughly on any subject matter.</p>
<p>Among the kavis, Usana was the spiritual master of the demons; he was extremely intelligent, far-seeing, political and spiritual in every way.</p>
<p>Thus Usana is another representative of the opulence of Krsna.</p>

<p>There are many suppressing agents, of which the most important are those that cut down the miscreants.</p>
<p>When miscreants are punished, the rod of chastisement represents Krsna.</p>
<p>Among those who are trying to be victorious in some field of activity, the most victorious element is morality.</p>
<p>Among the confidential activities of hearing, thinking and meditating, silence is most important because by silence one can make progress very quickly.</p>
<p>The wise man is he who can discriminate between matter and spirit, between God's superior and inferior natures.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is represented throughout the entire material universes by His entering into all things as the Supersoul.</p>
<p>The Lord here tells Arjuna that there is no point in understanding how things exist in their separate opulence and grandeur.</p>
<p>He should know that all things are existing due to Krsna's entering them as Supersoul.</p>
<p>From Brahma, the most gigantic entity, on down to the smallest ant, all are existing because the Lord has entered each and all and is sustaining them.</p>
<p>Worship of demigods is discouraged herein because even the greatest demigods like Brahma and Siva only represent part of the opulence of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He is the origin of everyone born, and no one is greater than Him.</p>
<p>He is samata, which means that no one is superior to Him and that no one is equal to Him.</p>
<p>In the Visnu-mantra it is said that one who considers the Supreme Lord Krsna in the same category with demigods--be they even Brahma or Siva--becomes at once an atheist.</p>
<p>If, however, one thoroughly studies the different descriptions of the opulences and expansions of Krsna's energy, then one can understand without any doubt the position of Lord Sri Krsna and can fix his mind in the worship of Krsna without deviation.</p>
<p>The Lord is all-pervading by the expansion of His partial representation, the Supersoul, who enters into everything that is.</p>
<p>Pure devotees, therefore, concentrate their minds in Krsna consciousness in full devotional service; therefore they are always situated in the transcendental position.</p>
<p>Devotional service and worship of Krsna are very clearly indicated in this chapter in verses eight to eleven.</p>
<p>That is the way of pure devotional service.</p>
<p>How one can attain the highest devotional perfection of association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been thoroughly explained in this chapter.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now dispelled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This chapter reveals Krsna as the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>He is even the cause of the Maha-Visnu, and from Him the material universes emanate.</p>
<p>Krsna is not an incarnation; He is the source of all incarnations.</p>
<p>That has been completely explained in the last chapter.</p>
<p>Now, as far as Arjuna is concerned, he says that his illusion is over.</p>
<p>This means that Arjuna no longer thinks of Krsna as a mere human being, as a friend of his, but as the source of everything.</p>
<p>Arjuna is very enlightened and is glad that he has a great friend like Krsna, but now he is thinking that although he may accept Krsna as the source of everything, others may not.</p>
<p>So in order to establish Krsna's divinity for all, he is requesting Krsna in this chapter to show His universal form.</p>
<p>Actually when one sees the universal form of Krsna one becomes frightened, like Arjuna, but Krsna is so kind that after showing it He converts Himself again into His original form.</p>
<p>Arjuna agrees to what Krsna says several times.</p>
<p>Krsna is speaking to him just for his benefit, and Arjuna acknowledges that all this is happening to him by Krsna's grace.</p>
<p>He is now convinced that Krsna is the cause of all causes and is present in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible glories.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna addresses Lord Krsna as "lotus-eyed" (Krsna's eyes appear just like the petals of a lotus flower) out of his joy, for Krsna has assured him, in the last verse of the previous chapter, that He sustains the entire universe with just a fragment of Himself.</p>
<p>He is the source of everything in this material manifestation, and Arjuna has heard of this from the Lord in detail.</p>
<p>Arjuna further knows that in spite of His being the source of all appearances and disappearances, He is aloof from them.</p>
<p>His personality is not lost, although He is all-pervading.</p>
<p>That is the inconceivable opulence of Krsna which Arjuna admits that he has thoroughly understood.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me Your actual position, I yet wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>I want to see that form of Yours.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord said that because He entered into the material universe by His personal representation, the cosmic manifestation has been made possible and is going on.</p>
<p>Now as far as Arjuna is concerned, he is inspired by the statements of Krsna, but in order to convince others in the future who may think that Krsna is an ordinary person, he desires to see Him actually in His universal form, to see how He is acting from within the universe, although He is apart from it.</p>
<p>Arjuna's asking the Lord's permission is also significant.</p>
<p>Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present within Arjuna himself; therefore He knows the desire of Arjuna, and He can understand that Arjuna has no special desire to see Him in His universal form, for he is completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form of Krsna.</p>
<p>But He can understand also that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to convince others.</p>
<p>He did not have any personal desire for confirmation.</p>
<p>Krsna also understands that Arjuna wants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God.</p>
<p>The people, therefore, should be careful; one who claims to be Krsna should be prepared to show his universal form to confirm his claim to the people.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If You think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that one can neither see, hear, understand nor perceive the Supreme Lord, Krsna, by the material senses.</p>
<p>But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation.</p>
<p>Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledges Krsna's inestimable position.</p>
<p>Arjuna could understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite.</p>
<p>If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite.</p>
<p>The word yogesvara is also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power.</p>
<p>If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna pleads for the inconceivable grace of Krsna.</p>
<p>He does not give Krsna orders.</p>
<p>Krsna is not obliged to reveal Himself to anyone unless one surrenders fully in Krsna consciousness and engages in devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to see Krsna.</p>

<p>It is not eternally situated in the spiritual sky like Krsna's other forms.</p>
<p>As far as a devotee is concerned, he is not eager to see the universal form, but because Arjuna wanted to see Krsna in this way, Krsna reveals this form.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A pure devotee does not like to see Krsna in any form except His form with two hands; a devotee must see His universal form by His grace, not with the mind but with spiritual eyes.</p>
<p>To see the universal form of Krsna, Arjuna is told not to change his mind but his vision.</p>
<p>The universal form of Krsna is not very important; that will be clear in the verses.</p>
<p>Yet because Arjuna wanted to see it, the Lord gives him the particular vision required to see that universal form.</p>
<p>Devotees who are correctly situated in a transcendental relationship with Krsna are attracted by loving features, not by a godless display of opulences.</p>
<p>The playmates of Krsna, the friends of Krsna and the parents of Krsna never want Krsna to show His opulences.</p>
<p>They are so immersed in pure love that they do not even know that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In their loving exchange they forget that Krsna is the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that the boys who play with Krsna are all highly pious souls, and after many, many births they are able to play with Krsna.</p>
<p>Such boys do not know that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>They take Him as a personal friend.</p>
<p>The Supreme Person is considered as the impersonal Brahman by great sages, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the devotees, and as a product of this material nature by ordinary men.</p>
<p>The fact is that the devotee is not concerned to see the visva-rupa, the universal form, but Arjuna wanted to see it to substantiate Krsna's statement so that in the future people could understand that Krsna not only theoretically or philosophically presented Himself as the Supreme but actually presented Himself as such to Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna must confirm this because Arjuna is the beginning of the parampara system.</p>
<p>Those who are actually interested to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and who follow in the footsteps of Arjuna should understand that Krsna not only theoretically presented Himself as the Supreme, but actually revealed Himself as the Supreme.</p>
<p>The Lord gave Arjuna the necessary power to see His universal form because He knew that Arjuna did not particularly want to see it, as we have already explained.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna saw in that universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes.</p>
<p>It was all wondrous.</p>
<p>The form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed in many garbs.</p>
<p>He was garlanded gloriously, and there were many scents smeared over His body.</p>
<p>All was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited.</p>
<p>This was seen by Arjuna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>These two verses indicate that there is no limit to the hands, mouths, legs, etc., of the Lord.</p>
<p>These manifestations are distributed throughout the universe and are unlimited.</p>
<p>By the grace of the Lord, Arjuna could see them while sitting in one place.</p>
<p>That is due to the inconceivable potency of Krsna.</p>

<p>If hundreds of thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might resemble the effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form.</p>

<p>What Arjuna saw was indescribable, yet Sanjaya is trying to give a mental picture of that great revelation to Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>Neither Sanjaya nor Dhrtarastra were present, but Sanjaya, by the grace of Vyasa, could see whatever happened.</p>
<p>Thus he now compares the situation, as far as it can be understood, to an imaginable phenomenon (i.e. thousands of suns).</p>

<p>At that time Arjuna could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word tatra (there) is very significant.</p>
<p>It indicates that both Arjuna and Krsna were sitting on the chariot when Arjuna saw the universal form.</p>
<p>Others on the battlefield could not see this form because Krsna gave the vision only to Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna could see in the body of Krsna many thousands of universes.</p>
<p>As we learn from Vedic scriptures, there are many universes and many planets.</p>
<p>Some of them are made of earth, some are made of gold, some are made of jewels, some are very great, some are not so great, etc.</p>
<p>Sitting on his chariot, Arjuna could see all these universes.</p>
<p>But no one could understand what was going on between Arjuna and Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Then, bewildered and astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray with folded hands, offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Once the divine vision is revealed, the relationship between Krsna and Arjuna changes immediately.</p>
<p>Before, Krsna and Arjuna had a relationship based on friendship, but here, after the revelation, Arjuna is offering obeisances with great respect, and with folded hands he is praying to Krsna.</p>
<p>He is praising the universal form.</p>
<p>Thus Arjuna's relationship becomes one of wonder rather than friendship.</p>
<p>Great devotees see Krsna as the reservoir of all relationships.</p>
<p>In the scriptures there are twelve basic kinds of relationships mentioned, and all of them are present in Krsna.</p>
<p>It is said that He is the ocean of all the relationships exchanged between two living entities, between the gods, or between the Supreme Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p>It is said that Arjuna was inspired by the relationship of wonder, and in that wonder, although he was by nature very sober, calm and quiet, he became ecstatic, his hair stood up, and he began to offer his obeisances unto the Supreme Lord with folded hands.</p>
<p>He was not, of course, afraid.</p>
<p>He was affected by the wonders of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The immediate context is wonder; his natural loving friendship was overwhelmed by wonder, and thus he reacted in this way.</p>

<p>I see Brahma sitting on the lotus flower as well as Lord Siva and many sages and divine serpents.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna sees everything in the universe; therefore he sees Brahma, who is the first creature in the universe, and the celestial serpent upon which the Garbhodakasayi Visnu lies in the lower regions of the universe.</p>
<p>This snake bed is called Vasuki.</p>
<p>There are also other snakes known as Vasuki.</p>
<p>Arjuna can see from the Garbhodakasayi Visnu up to the topmost part of the universe on the lotus-flower planet where Brahma, the first creature of the universe, resides.</p>
<p>That means that from the beginning to the end, everything could be seen by Arjuna sitting in one place on his chariot.</p>
<p>This was possible by the grace of the Supreme Lord, Krsna.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the extent of the six opulences of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people.</p>
<p>With the exception of you [the Pandavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Arjuna knew that Krsna was his friend and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was nonetheless puzzled by the various forms exhibited by Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore he asked further about the actual mission of this devastating force.</p>
<p>It is written in the Vedas that the Supreme Truth destroys everything, even Brahma.</p>
<p>Yasya brahme ca ksatram ca ubhe bhavata odanah mrtyur yasyopasecanam ka ittha veda yatra sah.</p>
<p>Eventually all the brahmanas, ksatriyas and everyone else are devoured by the Supreme.</p>
<p>This form of the Supreme Lord is an all-devouring giant, and here Krsna presents Himself in that form of all-devouring time.</p>
<p>Except for a few Pandavas, everyone who was present in that battlefield would be devoured by Him.</p>
<p>Arjuna was not in favor of the fight, and he thought it was better not to fight; then there would be no frustration.</p>
<p>In reply, the Lord is saying that even if he did not fight, every one of them would be destroyed, for that is His plan.</p>
<p>If he stopped fighting, they would die in another way.</p>
<p>Death cannot be checked, even if he did not fight.</p>
<p>In fact, they were already dead.</p>
<p>Time is destruction, and all manifestations are to be vanquished by the desire of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>That is the law of nature.</p>

<p>tasmat--therefore; tvam--you; uttistha--get up; yasah--fame; labhasva--gain; jitva--conquering; satrun--enemies; bhunksva--enjoy; rajyam--kingdom; samrddham--flourishing; maya--by Me; eva--certainly; ete--all these; nihatah--already killed; purvam eva--by previous elements; nimitta-matram--just become the cause; bhava--become; savyasacin--O Savyasacin.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore get up and prepare to fight.</p>
<p>After conquering your enemies you will enjoy a flourishing kingdom.</p>
<p>They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyasacin, can be but an instmment in the fight.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Savyasacin refers to one who can shoot arrows very expertly in the field; thus Arjuna is addressed as an expert warrior capable of delivering arrows to kill his enemies.</p>
<p>"Just become an instrument": nimitta-matram.</p>
<p>This word is also very significant.</p>
<p>The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations.</p>
<p>There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of "perhaps" and "maybe."</p>
<p>There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world.</p>
<p>What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home.</p>
<p>As long they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned.</p>
<p>But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivate Krsna consciousness is most intelligent.</p>
<p>The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God.</p>
<p>Thus the Battle of Kuruksetra was fought according to the plan of God.</p>
<p>Arjuna was refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight and at the same time desire the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Then he would be happy.</p>
<p>If one is in full Krsna consciousness and if his life is devoted to His transcendental service, he is perfect.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Every plan is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He is so kind and merciful to His devotees that He wants to give the credit to His devotees who carry out His plan according to His desire.</p>
<p>Life should therefore move in such a way that everyone acts in Krsna consciousness and understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the medium of a spiritual master.</p>
<p>The plans of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are understood by His mercy, and the plans of the devotees are as good as His plans.</p>
<p>One should follow such plans and be victorious in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As we have already explained, because of the situation created by the universal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna became bewildered in wonder; thus he began to offer his respectful obeisances to Krsna again and again, and with faltering voice he began to pray, not as a friend, but as a devotee in wonder.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Hrsikesa, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name and thus everyone becomes attached to You.</p>
<p>Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there.</p>
<p>All this is rightly done.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna, after hearing from Krsna about the outcome of the Battle of Kuruksetra, became an enlightened devotee of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He admitted that everything done by Krsna is quite fit.</p>
<p>Arjuna confirmed that Krsna is the maintainer and the object of worship for the devotees and the destroyer of the undesirables.</p>
<p>His actions are equally good for all.</p>
<p>Arjuna understood herein that when the Battle of Kuruksetra was being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight because Krsna was present there.</p>
<p>When Arjuna saw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised.</p>
<p>Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled.</p>
<p>Krsna's treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised by Arjuna.</p>
<p>In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O great one, who stands above even Brahma, You are the original master.</p>
<p>Why should they not offer their homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the universe, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By this offering of obeisances, Arjuna indicates that Krsna is worshipable by everyone.</p>
<p>He is all-pervading, and He is the Soul of every soul.</p>
<p>Arjuna is addressing Krsna as mahatma, which means that He is most magnanimous and unlimited.</p>
<p>Ananta indicates that there is nothing which is not covered by the influence and energy of the Supreme Lord, and devesa means that He is the controller of all demigods and is above them all.</p>
<p>He is the center of the whole universe.</p>
<p>Arjuna also thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and all powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him because no one is greater than Him.</p>
<p>He especially mentions that Krsna is greater than Brahma because Brahma is created by Him.</p>
<p>Brahma is born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of Garbhodakasayi Visnu, who is Krsna's plenary expansion; therefore Brahma and Lord Siva, who is born of Brahma, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord is respected by Lord Siva and Brahma and similar other demigods.</p>
<p>The word aksaram is very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction, but the Lord is above this material creation.</p>
<p>He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself.</p>
<p>He is therefore the all-great Supreme.</p>

<p>Although Krsna is manifested before Arjuna in His universal form, Arjuna remembers his friendly relationship with Krsna and is therefore asking pardon and requesting Him to excuse him for the many informal gestures which arise out of friendship.</p>
<p>He is admitting that formerly he did not know that Krsna could assume such a universal form, although He explained it as his intimate friend.</p>
<p>Arjuna did not know how many times he may have dishonored Him by addressing Him as "O my friend, O Krsna, O Yadava," etc., without acknowledging His opulence.</p>
<p>But Krsna is so kind and merciful that in spite of such opulence He played with Arjuna as a friend.</p>
<p>Such is the transcendental loving reciprocation between the devotee and the Lord.</p>
<p>The relationship between the living entity and Krsna is fixed eternally; it cannot be forgotten, as we can see from the behavior of Arjuna.</p>
<p>Although Arjuna has seen the opulence in the universal form, he could not forget his friendly relationship with Krsna.</p>

<p>No one is equal to You, nor can anyone be one with You.</p>
<p>Within the three worlds, You are immeasurable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord Krsna is worshipable as a father is worshipable for his son.</p>
<p>He is the spiritual master because He originally gave the Vedic instructions to Brahma, and presently He is also instructing Bhagavad-gita to Arjuna; therefore He is the original spiritual master, and any bona fide spiritual master at the present moment must be a descendant in the line of disciplic succession stemming from Krsna.</p>
<p>Without being a representative of Krsna, one cannot become a teacher or spiritual master of transcendental subject matter.</p>
<p>The Lord is being paid obeisances in all respects.</p>
<p>He is of immeasurable greatness.</p>
<p>No one can be greater than the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, because no one is equal to or higher than Krsna within any manifestation, spiritual or material.</p>
<p>Everyone is below Him.</p>
<p>No one can excel Him.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Krsna has senses and a body like the ordinary man, but for Him there is no difference between His senses, body, mind and Himself.</p>
<p>Foolish persons who do not know Him perfectly say that Krsna is different from His soul, mind, heart and everything else.</p>
<p>Krsna is absolute; therefore His activities and potencies are supreme.</p>
<p>It is also stated that He does not have senses like ours.</p>
<p>He can perform all sensual activities; therefore His senses are neither imperfect nor limited.</p>
<p>No one can be greater than Him, no one can be equal to Him, and everyone is lower than Him.</p>
<p>Whoever knows His transcendental body, activities and perfection, after quitting his body, returns to Him and doesn't come back again to this miserable world.</p>
<p>Therefore one should know that Krsna's activities are different from others.</p>
<p>The best policy is to follow the principles of Krsna; that will make one perfect.</p>
<p>It is also stated that there is no one who is master of Krsna; everyone is His servant.</p>
<p>Only Krsna is God, and everyone is servant.</p>
<p>Everyone is complying with His order.</p>
<p>There is no one who can deny His order.</p>
<p>Everyone is acting according to His direction, being under His superintendence.</p>

<p>After seeing this universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same time my mind is disturbed with fear.</p>
<p>Therefore please bestow Your grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord of lords, O abode of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna is always in confidence with Krsna because he is a very dear friend, and as a dear friend is gladdened by his friend's opulence, Arjuna is very joyful to see that his friend, Krsna, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can show such a wonderful universal form.</p>
<p>But at the same time, after seeing that universal form, he is afraid that he has committed so many offenses to Krsna out of his unalloyed friendship.</p>
<p>Thus his mind is disturbed out of fear, although he had no reason to fear.</p>
<p>Arjuna therefore is asking Krsna to show His Narayana form because He can assume any form.</p>
<p>This universal form is material and temporary, as the material world is temporary.</p>
<p>But in the Vaikuntha planets He has His transcendental form with four hands as Narayana.</p>
<p>There are innumerable planets in the spiritual sky, and in each of them Krsna is present by His plenary manifestations of different names.</p>
<p>Thus Arjuna desired to see one of the forms manifest in the Vaikuntha planets.</p>
<p>Of course in each Vaikuntha planet the form of Narayana is four-handed, and the four hands hold different symbols, the conchshell, mace, lotus and disc.</p>
<p>According to the different hands these four things are held in, the Narayanas are named.</p>
<p>All of these forms are one and the same to Krsna; therefore Arjuna requests to see His four-handed feature.</p>

<p>This verse establishes without any doubt the statement of the Srimad-Bhagavatam that Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead and all other features originate from Him.</p>
<p>He is not different from His plenary expansions, and He is God in any of His innumerable forms.</p>
<p>In all of these forms He is fresh like a young man.</p>
<p>That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One who knows Krsna at once becomes free from all contamination of the material world.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form within the material world by My internal potency.</p>
<p>No one before you has ever seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna wanted to see the universal form of the Supreme Lord, so out of His mercy upon His devotee Arjuna, Lord Krsna showed His universal form full of effulgence and opulence.</p>
<p>This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing.</p>
<p>Krsna showed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friend Arjuna.</p>
<p>This form was manifested by Krsna through His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation.</p>
<p>No one had seen this universal form of the Lord before Arjuna, but because the form was shown to Arjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it.</p>
<p>They did not see it before, but because of Arjuna they were also able to see it.</p>
<p>In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown to Arjuna by the mercy of Krsna.</p>
<p>Someone commented that this form was shown to Duryodhana also when Krsna went to Duryodhana to negotiate for peace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Duryodhana did not accept the peace offer, but at that time Krsna manifested some of His universal forms.</p>
<p>But those forms are different from this one shown to Arjuna.</p>
<p>It is clearly said that no one has ever seen this form before.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O best of the Kuru warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of Mine, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing sacrifices, nor by charities or similar activities can this form be seen.</p>
<p>Only you have seen this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The divine vision in this connection should be clearly understood.</p>
<p>Who can have divine vision? Divine means godly.</p>
<p>Unless one attains the status of divinity as a demigod, he cannot have divine vision.</p>
<p>And what is a demigod? It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of Lord Visnu are demigods.</p>
<p>Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe in Visnu, or who only recognize the impersonal part of Krsna as the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision.</p>
<p>It is not possible to decry Krsna and at the same time have the divine vision.</p>
<p>One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine.</p>
<p>In other words, those who have divine vision can also see like Arjuna.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita gives the description of the universal form, and this description was unknown to everyone before Arjuna.</p>
<p>Now one can have some idea of the visva-rupa after this incidence; those who are actually divine can see the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>But one cannot be divine without being a pure devotee of Krsna.</p>
<p>The devotees, however, who are actually in the divine nature and who have divine vision, are not very much interested to see the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>As described in the previous verse, Arjuna desired to see the four-handed form of Lord Krsna as Visnu, and he was actually afraid of the universal form.</p>
<p>In this verse there are some significant words, just like veda-yajnadhya-yanaih, which refers to studying Vedic literature and the subject matter of sacrificial regulations.</p>
<p>Veda refers to all kinds of Vedic literature, namely the four Vedas (Rk, Yajus, Sama and Atharva) and the eighteen Puranas and Upanisads, and Vedanta-sutra.</p>
<p>One can study these at home or anywhere else.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are sutras, Kalpa-sutras and Mimamsa-sutras, for studying the method of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Danaih refers to charity which is offered to a suitable party, such as those who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, the brahmanas and the Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Similarly, pious activities refer to the agni-hotra, etc., the prescribed duties of the different castes.</p>
<p>Pious activities and the voluntary acceptance of some bodily pains are called tapasya.</p>
<p>So one can perform all these, can accept bodily penances, give charity, study the Vedas, etc., but unless he is a devotee like Arjuna, it is not possible to see that universal form.</p>
<p>Those who are impersonalists are also imagining that they are seeing the universal form of the Lord, but from Bhagavad-gita we understand that the impersonalists are not devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore they are unable to see the universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many persons who create incarnations.</p>
<p>They falsely claim an ordinary human to be an incarnation, but this is all foolishness.</p>
<p>We should follow the principles of Bhagavad-gita, otherwise there is no possibility of attaining perfect spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>Although Bhagavad-gita is considered the preliminary study of the science of God, still it is so perfect that one can distinguish what is what.</p>
<p>The followers of a pseudo incarnation may say that they have also seen the transcendental incarnation of God, the universal form, but that is not acceptable because it is clearly stated here that unless one becomes a devotee of Krsna, one cannot see the universal form of God.</p>
<p>So one first of all has to become a pure devotee of Krsna; then he can claim that he can show the universal form of what he has seen.</p>
<p>A devotee of Krsna cannot accept false incarnations or followers of false incarnations.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of Bhagavad-gita Arjuna was worried about killing Bhisma and Drona, his worshipful grandfathers and masters.</p>
<p>But Krsna said that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather.</p>
<p>When they tried to disrobe Draupadi in the assembly, Bhisma and Drona were silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed.</p>
<p>Krsna showed His universal form to Arjuna just to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action.</p>
<p>That scene was shown to Arjuna because devotees are always peaceful, and they cannot perform such horrible actions.</p>
<p>The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; now Arjuna wanted to see the four-armed form, and Krsna showed him.</p>
<p>A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings.</p>
<p>A devotee wants to offer his respectful worshiping feelings; thus he wants to see the two-handed or four-handed Krsna form so he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>When Krsna appeared as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki, He first of all appeared as four-armed Narayana, but when He was requested by His parents, He transformed Himself into an ordinary child in appearance.</p>
<p>Similarly, Krsna knew that Arjuna was not interested in seeing a four-handed form of Krsna, but since he asked to see this four-handed form, He also showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form.</p>
<p>The word saumya-vapuh is very significant.</p>
<p>Saumya-vapu is a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form.</p>
<p>When He was present, everyone was attracted simply by Krsna's form, and because Krsna is director of the universe, He just banished the fear of Arjuna, His devotee, and showed him again His beautiful form of Krsna.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form of Sri Krsna.</p>

<p>When Arjuna thus saw Krsna in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike form, so very beautiful, my mind is now pacified, and I am restored to my original nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the words manusam rupam clearly indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be originally two-handed.</p>
<p>Those who deride Krsna to be an ordinary person are shown here to be ignorant of His divine nature.</p>
<p>If Krsna is like an ordinary human being, then how is it possible for Him to show the universal form and again to show the four-handed Narayana form? So it is very clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita that one who thinks that Krsna is an ordinary person and misguides the reader by claiming that it is the impersonal Brahman within Krsna speaking, is doing the greatest injustice.</p>
<p>Krsna has actually shown His universal form and His fourhanded Visnu form.</p>
<p>So how can He be an ordinary human being? A pure devotee is not confused by misguiding commentaries on Bhagavad-gita because he knows what is what.</p>
<p>The original verses of Bhagavad-gita are as clear as the sun; they do not require lamplight from foolish commentators.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: My dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold.</p>
<p>Even the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form which is so dear.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the forty-eighth verse of this chapter Lord Krsna concluded revealing His universal form and informed Arjuna that this form is not possible to be seen by so many activities, sacrifices, etc.</p>
<p>Now here the word sudurdarsam is used, indicating that Krsna's two-handed form is still more confidential.</p>
<p>One may be able to see the universal form of Krsna by adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penance, Vedic study and philosophical speculation, etc.</p>
<p>It may be possible, but without a tinge of bhakti, one cannot see; that has already been explained.</p>
<p>Still, beyond that universal form, the form of Krsna as a two-handed man is still more difficult to see, even for demigods like Brahma and Lord Siva.</p>
<p>They desire to see Him, and we have evidences in the Srimad-Bhagavatam that when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother, Devaki, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel of Krsna.</p>
<p>They even waited to see Him.</p>
<p>A foolish person may deride Him, but that is an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Krsna is actually desired to be seen by demigods like Brahma and Siva in His two-armed form.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita it is also confirmed that He is not visible to the foolish persons who deride Him.</p>
<p>Krsna's body, as confirmed by Brahma-samhita and confirmed by Himself in Bhagavad-gita, is completely spiritual and full of bliss and eternality.</p>
<p>His body is never like a material body.</p>
<p>But for some who make a study of Krsna by reading Bhagavad-gita or similar Vedic scriptures, Krsna is a problem.</p>
<p>For one using a material process, Krsna is considered to be a great historical personality and very learned philosopher.</p>
<p>But He isn't an ordinary man.</p>
<p>But some think that even though He was so powerful, He had to accept a material body.</p>
<p>Ultimately they think that the Absolute Truth is impersonal; therefore they think that from His impersonal feature He assumed a personal feature attached to material nature.</p>
<p>This is a materialistic calculation of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Another calculation is speculative.</p>
<p>Those who are in search of knowledge also speculate on Krsna and consider Him to be less important than the universal form of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Thus some think that the universal form of Krsna which was manifested to Arjuna is more important than His personal form.</p>
<p>According to them, the personal form of the Supreme is something imaginary.</p>
<p>They believe that in the ultimate issue, the Absolute Truth is not a person.</p>
<p>But the transcendental process is described in Bhagavad-gita, Chapter Two: to hear about Krsna from authorities.</p>
<p>That is the actual Vedic process, and those who are actually in the Vedic line hear about Krsna from authority, and by repeated hearing about Him, Krsna becomes dear.</p>
<p>As we have several times discussed, Krsna is covered by His yoga-maya potency.</p>
<p>He is not to be seen or revealed to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>Only by one to whom He reveals Himself can He be seen.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Vedic literature; for one who is a surrendered soul, the Absolute Truth can actually be understood.</p>
<p>The transcendentalist, by continuous Krsna consciousness and by devotional service to Krsna, can have his spiritual eyes opened and can see Krsna by revelation.</p>
<p>Such a revelation is not possible even for the demigods; therefore it is difficult even for the demigods to understand Krsna, and the advanced demigods are always in hope of seeing Krsna in His two-handed form.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that although to see the universal form of Krsna is very, very difficult and not possible for anyone and everyone, it is still more difficult to understand His personal form as Syamasundara.</p>

<p>Krsna first appeared before His parents Devaki and Vasudeva in a four-handed form, and then He transformed Himself into the two-handed form.</p>
<p>This mystery is very difficult to understand for those who are atheists or who are devoid of devotional service.</p>
<p>For scholars who have simply studied Vedic literature by way of speculation or out of mere academic interest, Krsna is not easy to understand.</p>
<p>Nor is He to he understood by persons who officially go to the temple to offer worship.</p>
<p>They make their visit, but they cannot understand Krsna as He is.</p>
<p>Krsna can be understood only through the path of devotional service, as explained by Krsna Himself in the next verse.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, only by undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and can thus be seen directly.</p>
<p>Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of My understanding.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna can be understood only by the process of undivided devotional service.</p>
<p>He explicitly explains this in this verse so unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-gita by the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time.</p>
<p>No one can understand Krsna or how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated here that no one can see Him.</p>
<p>Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways.</p>
<p>There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understand Krsna, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature.</p>
<p>One can perform penance in accordance with those principles.</p>
<p>As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees of Krsna who are engaged in His devotional service to spread the Krsna philosophy or Krsna consciousness throughout the world.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is a benediction to humanity.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya was appreciated by Rupa Gosvami as the most munificent man of charity because love of Krsna, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him.</p>
<p>And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually of Visnu or Krsna), that is a chance to progress.</p>
<p>For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is very essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>One who has unflinching devotion for the Supreme Lord and is directed by the spiritual master can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by revelation.</p>
<p>For one who does not take personal training under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, it is impossible to even begin to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>The word tu is specifically used here to indicate that no other process can be used, can be recommended, or can be successful in understanding Krsna.</p>
<p>The personal forms of Krsna, the two-handed form and the four-handed, are completely different from the temporary universal form shown to Arjuna.</p>
<p>The four-handed form is Narayana, and the two-handed form is Krsna; they are eternal and transcendental, whereas the universal form exhibited to Arjuna is temporary.</p>
<p>The very word sudurdarsam, meaning difficult to see, suggests that no one saw that universal form.</p>
<p>It also suggests that amongst the devotees there was no necessity of showing it.</p>
<p>That form was exhibited by Krsna at the request of Arjuna because in the future, when one represents himself as an incarnation of God, people can ask to see his universal form.</p>
<p>Krsna changes from the universal form to the four-handed form of Narayana and then to His own natural form of two hands.</p>
<p>This indicates that the four-handed forms and other forms mentioned in Vedic literature are all emanations of the original two-handed Krsna.</p>
<p>He is the origin of all emanations.</p>
<p>Krsna is distinct even from these forms, not to speak of the impersonal conception.</p>
<p>As far as the four-handed forms of Krsna are concerned, it is stated clearly that even the most identical four-handed form of Krsna (which is known as Maha-Visnu, who is lying on the cosmic ocean and from whose breathing so many innumerable universes are passing out and entering) is also an expansion of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore one should conclusively worship the personal form of Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is eternity, bliss and knowledge.</p>
<p>He is the source of all forms of Visnu, He is the source of all forms of incarnation, and He is the original Supreme Personality, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature it is stated that the Supreme Absolute Truth is a person.</p>
<p>His name is Krsna, and He sometimes descends on this earth.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Srimad-Bhagavatam there is a description of all kinds of incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there it is said that Krsna is not an incarnation of God but is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.</p>
<p>Krsnas tu bhagavan svayam.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, mattah parataram nanyat: "There is nothing superior to My form as the Personality of Godhead Krsna."</p>
<p>He also says elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita, aham adir hi devanam: "I am the origin of all the demigods."</p>
<p>And after understanding Bhagavad-gita from Krsna, Arjuna also confirms this in the following words: param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan: "I now fully understand that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, and that You are the refuge of everything."</p>
<p>Therefore the universal form which Krsna showed to Arjuna is not the original form of God.</p>
<p>The original is the Krsna form.</p>
<p>The universal form, with its thousands and thousands of heads and hands, is manifest just to draw the attention of those who have no love for God.</p>
<p>It is not God's original form.</p>
<p>The universal form is not attractive for pure devotees, who are in love with the Lord in different transcendental relationships.</p>
<p>The Supreme Godhead exchanges transcendental love in His original form of Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore to Arjuna, who was so intimately related with Krsna in friendship, this form of the universal manifestation was not pleasing; rather, it was fearful.</p>
<p>Arjuna, who is a constant companion of Krsna's, must have had transcendental eyes; he was not an ordinary man.</p>
<p>Therefore he was not captivated by the universal form.</p>
<p>This form may seem wonderful to persons who are involved in elevating themselves by fruitive activities, but to persons who are engaged in devotional service, the two-handed form of Krsna is the most dear.</p>

<p>My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is friendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who wants to approach the Supreme of all the Personalities of Godhead, on the Krsnaloka planet in the spiritual sky, and be intimately connected with the Supreme Personality, Krsna, must take this formula, as is stated by the Supreme Himself.</p>
<p>Therefore, this verse is considered to be the essence of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita is a book directed to the conditioned souls, who are engaged in the material world with the purpose of lording it over nature and who do not know of the real, spiritual life.</p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita is meant to show how one can understand his spiritual existence and his eternal relationship with the Supreme Spiritual Personality and to teach one how to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Now here is the verse which clearly explains the process by which one can attain success in his spiritual activity: devotional service.</p>
<p>As far as work is concerned, one should transfer his energy entirely to Krsna conscious activities.</p>
<p>No work should be done by any man except in relationship to Krsna.</p>
<p>This called Krsna-karma.</p>
<p>One may be engaged in various activities, but one should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be done for Him.</p>
<p>For example, one may be engaged in business, but to transform that activity into Krsna consciousness, one has to do business for Krsna.</p>
<p>If Krsna is the proprietor of the business, then Krsna should enjoy the profit of the business.</p>
<p>If a businessman is in possession of thousands and thousands of dollars, and if he has to offer all this to Krsna, he can do it.</p>
<p>This is work for Krsna.</p>
<p>Instead of constructing a big building for his sense gratification, he can construct a nice temple for Krsna, and he can install the Deity of Krsna and arrange for the Deity's service, as is outlined in the authorized books of devotional service.</p>
<p>This is all Krsna-karma.</p>
<p>One should not be attached to the result of his work, but the result should be offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>One should also accept as prasadam, food, the remnants of offerings to Krsna.</p>
<p>If, however, one is not able to construct a temple for Krsna, one can engage himself in cleansing the temple of Krsna; that is also Krsna-karma.</p>
<p>One can cultivate a garden.</p>
<p>Anyone who has land--in India, at least, any poor man has a certain amount of land--can utilize that for Krsna by growing flowers to offer Him.</p>
<p>He can sow tulasi plants because tulasi leaves are very important, and Krsna has recommended this in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Krsna desires that one offer Him either a leaf, or a flower, or a little water--and He is satisfied.</p>
<p>This leaf especially refers to the tulasi So one can sow tulasi leaves and pour water on the plant.</p>
<p>Thus, even the poorest man can engage in the service of Krsna.</p>
<p>These are some of the examples of how one can engage in working for Krsna.</p>
<p>The word mat-paramah refers to one who considers the association of Krsna in His supreme abode to be the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>Such a person does not wish to be elevated to the higher planets such as the moon or sun or heavenly planets, or even the highest planet of this universe, Brahmaloka.</p>
<p>He has no attraction for that.</p>
<p>He is only attracted to being transferred to the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>And even in the spiritual sky he is not satisfied with merging into the glowing brahmajyoti effulgence, for he wants to enter the highest spiritual planet, namely Krsnaloka, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>He has full knowledge of that planet, and therefore he is not interested in any other.</p>
<p>As indicated by the word mad-bhaktah, he fully engages in devotional service, specifically in the nine processes of devotional engagement: hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering prayers, carrying out the orders of the Lord, making friends with Him, and surrendering everything to Him.</p>
<p>One can engage in all nine devotional processes, or eight, or seven, or at least in one, and that will surely make one perfect.</p>
<p>The term sanga-varjitah is very significant.</p>
<p>One should disassociate himself from persons who are against Krsna.</p>
<p>Not only are the atheistic persons against Krsna, but also those who are attracted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.</p>
<p>Therefore the pure form of devotional service is described in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu as follows: anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam anukulyena krsnanusilanam bhaktir uttama.</p>
<p>In this verse Srila Rupa Gosvami clearly states that if anyone wants to execute unalloyed devotional service, he must be freed from all kinds of material contamination.</p>
<p>He must be freed from the association of persons who are addicted to fruitive activities and mental speculation.</p>
<p>When, freed from such unwanted association and from the contamination of material desires, one favorably cultivates knowledge of Krsna, that is called pure devotional service.</p>
<p>Anukulyasya sankaplah pratikulyasya varjanam.</p>
<p>One should think of Krsna and act for Krsna favorably, not unfavorably.</p>
<p>Kamsa was an enemy of Krsna's.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of Krsna's birth, he planned in so many ways to kill Him, and because he was always unsuccessful, he was always thinking of Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus while working, while eating and while sleeping, he was always Krsna conscious in every respect, but that Krsna consciousness was not favorable, and therefore in spite of his always thinking of Krsna twenty-four hours a day, he was considered a demon, and Krsna at last killed him.</p>
<p>Of course anyone who is killed by Krsna attains salvation immediately, but that is not the aim of the pure devotee.</p>
<p>The pure devotee does not even want salvation.</p>
<p>He does not want to be transferred even to the highest planet, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>His only objective is to serve Krsna wherever he may be.</p>
<p>A devotee of Krsna is friendly to everyone.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said here that he has no enemy.</p>
<p>How is this? A devotee situated in Krsna consciousness knows that only devotional service to Krsna can relieve a person from all the problems of life.</p>
<p>He has personal experience of this, and therefore he wants to introduce this system, Krsna consciousness, into human society.</p>
<p>There are many examples in history of devotees of the Lord risking their lives for the spreading of God consciousness.</p>
<p>The favorite example is Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>He was crucified by the nondevotees, but He sacrificed His life for spreading God consciousness.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be superficial to understand that He was killed.</p>
<p>Similarly, in India also there are many examples, such as Thakur Haridasa.</p>
<p>Why such risk? Because they wanted to spread Krsna consciousness, and it is difficult.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person knows that if a man is suffering, it is due to his forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, the highest benefit one can render to human society is relieving one's neighbor from all material problems.</p>
<p>In such a way, a pure devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Now, we can imagine how merciful Krsna is to those engaged in His service, risking everything for Him.</p>
<p>Therefore it is certain that such persons must reach the supreme planet after leaving the body.</p>
<p>In summary, the universal form of Krsna, which is a temporary manifestation, and the form of time which devours everything, and even the form of Visnu, four-handed, have all been exhibited by Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus Krsna is the origin of all these manifestations.</p>
<p>It is not that Krsna is a manifestation of the original visva-rupa, or Visnu.</p>
<p>Krsna is the origin of all forms.</p>
<p>There are hundreds and thousands of Visnus, but for a devotee, no form of Krsna is important but the original form, two-handed Syamasundara.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated that those who are attached to the Syamasundara form of Krsna in love and devotion can see Him always within the heart and cannot see anything else.</p>
<p>One should understand, therefore, that the purport of this Eleventh Chapter is that the form of Krsna is essential and supreme.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna inquired: Which is considered to be more perfect: those who are properly engaged in Your devotional service, or those who worship the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna has now explained about the personal, the impersonal and the universal and has described all kinds of devotees and yogis.</p>
<p>Generally, the transcendentalists can be divided into two classes.</p>
<p>One is the impersonalist, and the other is the personalist.</p>
<p>The personalist devotee engages himself with all energy in the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The impersonalist engages himself not directly in the service of Krsna but in meditation on the impersonal Brahman, the unmanifested.</p>
<p>We find in this chapter that of the different processes for realization of the Absolute Truth, bhakti-yoga, devotional service, is the highest.</p>
<p>If one at all desires to have the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he must take to devotional service.</p>
<p>Those who worship the Supreme Lord directly by devotional service are called personalists.</p>
<p>Those who engage themselves in meditation on the impersonal Brahman are called impersonalists.</p>
<p>Arjuna is here questioning which position is better.</p>
<p>There are different ways to realize the Absolute Truth, but Krsna indicates in this chapter that bhakti-yoga, or devotional service to Him, is highest of all.</p>
<p>It is the most direct, and it is the easiest means for association with the Godhead.</p>
<p>In the Second Chapter the Lord explains that a living entity is not the material body but is a spiritual spark, a part of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>In the Seventh Chapter He speaks of the living entity as part and parcel of the supreme whole and recommends that he transfer his attention fully to the whole.</p>
<p>In the Eighth Chapter it is stated that whoever thinks of Krsna at the moment of death is at once transferred to the spiritual sky, Krsna's abode.</p>
<p>And at the end of the Sixth Chapter the Lord says that out of all the yogis, he who thinks of Krsna within himself is considered to be the most perfect.</p>
<p>So throughout the Gita personal devotion to Krsna is recommended as the highest form of spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Yet there are those who are still attracted to Krsna's impersonal brahmajyoti effulgence, which is the all-pervasive aspect of the Absolute Truth and which is unmanifest and beyond the reach of the senses.</p>
<p>Arjuna would like to know which of these two types of transcendentalists is more perfect in knowledge.</p>
<p>In other words, he is clarifying his own position because he is attached to the personal form of Krsna.</p>
<p>He is not attached to the impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>He wants to know whether his position is secure.</p>
<p>The impersonal manifestation, either in this material world or in the spiritual world of the Supreme Lord, is a problem for meditation.</p>
<p>Actually, one cannot perfectly conceive of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Therefore Arjuna wants to say, "What is the use of such a waste of time?" Arjuna experienced in the Eleventh Chapter that to be attached to the personal form of Krsna is best because he could thus understand all other forms at the same time and there was no disturbance to his love for Krsna.</p>
<p>This important question asked of Krsna by Arjuna will clarify the distinction between the impersonal and personal conceptions of the Absolute Truth.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: He whose mind is fixed on My personal form, always engaged in worshiping Me with great and transcendental faith, is considered by Me to be most perfect.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In answer to Arjuna's question, Krsna clearly says that he who concentrates upon His personal form and who worships Him with faith and devotion is to be considered most perfect in yoga.</p>
<p>For one in such Krsna consciousness there are no material activities because everything is done by Krsna.</p>
<p>A pure devotee is constantly engaged--sometimes he chants, sometimes he hears or reads books about Krsna, or sometimes he cooks prasadam or goes to the marketplace to purchase something for Krsna, or sometimes he washes the temple or the dishes--whatever he does, he does not let a single moment pass without devoting his activities to Krsna Such action is in full samadhi.</p>

<p>But those who fully worship the unmanifested, that which lies beyond the perception of the senses, the all-pervading, inconceivable, fixed, and immovable--the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth--by controlling the various senses and being equally disposed to everyone, such persons, engaged in the welfare of all, at last achieve Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who do not directly worship the Supreme Godhead, Krsna, but who attempt to achieve the same goal by an indirect process, also ultimately achieve the supreme goal, Sri Krsna, as is stated, "After many births the man of wisdom seeks refuge in Me, knowing Vasudeva is all."</p>
<p>When a person comes to full knowledge after many births, he surrenders unto Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>If one approaches the Godhead by the method mentioned in this verse, he has to control the senses, render service to everyone and engage in the welfare of all beings.</p>
<p>It is inferred that one has to approach Lord Krsna, otherwise there is no perfect realization.</p>
<p>Often there is much penance involved before one fully surrenders unto Him.</p>
<p>In order to perceive the Supersoul within the individual soul, one has to cease the sensual activities of seeing, hearing, tasting, working, etc.</p>
<p>Then one comes to understand that the Supreme Soul is present everywhere.</p>
<p>Realizing this, one envies no living entity--he sees no difference between man and animal because he sees soul only, not the outer covering.</p>
<p>But for the common man, this method of impersonal realization is very difficult.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.</p>
<p>To make progrese in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The group of transcendentalists who follow the path of the inconceivable, unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord are called jnana-yogis, and persons who are in full Krsna consciousness, engaged in devotional service to the Lord, are called bhakti-yogis.</p>
<p>Now, here the difference between jnana-yoga and bhakti-yoga is definitely expressed.</p>
<p>The process of jnana-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path of bhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul.</p>
<p>The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body.</p>
<p>Therefore, the bhakti-yogi accepts the Deity of Krsna as worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied.</p>
<p>Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship.</p>
<p>There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguna and nirguna--of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes.</p>
<p>Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguna worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities.</p>
<p>But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood, or oil paint, is not actually material.</p>
<p>That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>A crude example may be given here.</p>
<p>We may find some mailboxes on the street, and if we post our letters in those boxes, they will naturally go to their destination without difficulty.</p>
<p>But any old box, or an imitation, which we may find somewhere, which is not authorized by the post office, will not do the work.</p>
<p>Similarly, God has an authorized representation in the Deity form, which is called arca-vigraha.</p>
<p>This arca-vigraha is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>God will accept service through that form.</p>
<p>The Lord is omnipotent and all-powerful; therefore, by His incarnation as arca-vigraha, He can accept the services of the devotee, just to make it convenient for the man in conditioned life.</p>
<p>So, for a devotee, there is no difficulty in approaching the Supreme immediately and directly, but for those who are following the impersonal way to spiritual realization, the path is difficult.</p>
<p>They have to understand the unmanifested representation of the Supreme through such Vedic literatures as the Upanisads, and they have to learn the language, understand the nonperceptual feelings, and they have to realize all these processes.</p>
<p>This is not very easy for a common man.</p>
<p>A person in Krsna consciousness, engaged in devotional service, simply by the guidance of the bona fide spiritual master, simply by offering regulative obeisances unto the Deity, simply by hearing the glories of the Lord, and simply by eating the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, realizes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the impersonalists are unnecessarily taking a troublesome path with the risk of not realizing the Absolute Truth at the ultimate end.</p>
<p>But the personalist, without any risk, trouble, or difficulty, approaches the Supreme Personality directly.</p>
<p>A similar passage appears in Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>It is stated there that if one has to ultimately surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead (This surrendering process is called bhakti.), but instead takes the trouble to understand what is Brahman and what is not Brahman and spends his whole life in that way, the result is simply troublesome.</p>
<p>Therefore it is advised here that one should not take up this troublesome path of self-realization because there is uncertainty in the ultimate result.</p>
<p>A living entity is eternally an individual soul, and if he wants to merge into the spiritual whole, he may accomplish the realization of the eternal and knowledgeable aspects of his original nature, but the blissful portion is not realized.</p>
<p>By the grace of some devotee, such a transcendentalist, highly learned in the process of jnana-yoga, may come to the point of bhakti-yoga, or devotional service.</p>
<p>At that time, long practice in impersonalism also becomes a source of trouble, because he cannot give up the idea.</p>
<p>Therefore an embodied soul is always in difficulty with the unmanifest, both at the time of practice and at the time of realization.</p>
<p>Every living soul is partially independant, and one should know for certain that this unmanifested realization is against the nature of his spiritual blissful self.</p>
<p>One should not take up this process.</p>
<p>For every individual living entity the process of Krsna consciousness, which entails full engagement in devotional service, is the best way.</p>
<p>If one wants to ignore this devotional service, there is the danger of turning to atheism.</p>
<p>Thus this process of centering attention on the unmanifested, the inconceivable, which is beyond the approach of the senses, as already expressed in this verse, should never be encouraged at any time, especially in this age.</p>
<p>It is not advised by Lord Krsna.</p>

<p>For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of Prtha, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is explicitly stated here that the devotees are very fortunate to be delivered very soon from material existence by the Lord.</p>
<p>In pure devotional service one comes to the realization that God is great and that the individual soul is subordinate to Him.</p>
<p>His duty is to render service to the Lord--if not, then he will render service to maya.</p>
<p>As stated before, the Supreme Lord can only be appreciated by devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should be fully devoted.</p>
<p>One should fix his mind fully on Krsna in order to achieve Him.</p>
<p>One should work only for Krsna.</p>
<p>It does not matter in what kind of work one engages, but that work should be done only for Krsna.</p>
<p>That is the standard of devotional service.</p>
<p>The devotee does not desire any achievement other than pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>His life's mission is to please Krsna, and he can sacrifice everything for Krsna's satisfaction, just as Arjuna did in the Battle of Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>The process is very simple: one can devote himself in his occupation and engage at the same time in chanting Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>Such transcendental chanting attracts the devotee to the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord herein promises that He will without delay deliver a pure devotee thus engaged from the ocean of material existence.</p>
<p>Those who are advanced in yoga practice can willfully transfer the soul to whatever planet they like by the yoga process, and others take the opportunity in various ways, but as far as the devotee is concerned, it is clearly stated here that the Lord Himself takes him.</p>
<p>He does not need to wait to become very experienced in order to transfer himself to the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>In the Varaha Purana this verse appears:</p>
<p>nayami paramam sthanam arciradi-gatim vina garuda-skandham aropya yatheccham anivaritah</p>
<p>The purport of this verse is that a devotee does not need to practice astanga-yoga in order to transfer his soul to the spiritual planets.</p>
<p>The responsibility is taken by the Supreme Lord Himself.</p>
<p>He clearly states here that He Himself becomes the deliverer.</p>
<p>A child is completely cared for by his parents, and thus his position is secure.</p>
<p>Similarly, a devotee does not need to endeavor to transfer himself by yoga practice to other planets.</p>
<p>Rather, the Supreme Lord, by His great mercy, comes at once, riding on His bird carrier Garuda, and at once delivers the devotee from this material existence.</p>
<p>Although a man who has fallen in the ocean may struggle very hard and may be very expert in swimming, he cannot save himself.</p>
<p>But if someone comes and picks him up from the water, then he is easily rescued.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Lord picks up the devotee from this material existence.</p>
<p>One simply has to practice the easy process of Krsna consciousness and fully engage himself in devotional service.</p>
<p>Any intelligent man should always prefer the process of devotional service to all other paths.</p>
<p>In the Narayaniya this is confirmed as follows:</p>
<p>ya vai sadhana-sampatti-purusartha-catustaye taya vina tad-apnoti naro narayanasrayah</p>
<p>The purport of this verse is that one should not engage in the different processes of fruitive activity or cultivate knowledge by the mental speculative process.</p>
<p>One who is devoted to the Supreme Personality can attain all the benefits derived from other yogic processes, speculation, rituals, sacrifices, charities, etc.</p>
<p>That is the specific benediction of devotional service.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the holy name of Krsna--Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare--a devotee of the Lord can approach the supreme destination easily and happily, but this destination cannot be approached by any other process of religion.</p>
<p>The conclusion of Bhagavad-gita is stated in the Eighteenth Chapter:</p>
<p>sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah.</p>
<p>One should give up all other processes of self-realization and simply execute devotional service in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That will enable one to reach the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>There is no need for one to consider the sinful actions of his past life because the Supreme Lord fully takes charge of him.</p>
<p>Therefore one should not futilely try to deliver himself in spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Let everyone take shelter of the supreme omnipotent Godhead Krsna.</p>
<p>That is the highest perfection of life.</p>

<p>A devotee does not live on the material plane--he lives in Krsna.</p>
<p>The holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent; therefore when a devotee chants Hare Krsna, Krsna and His internal potency are dancing on the tongue of the devotee.</p>
<p>When he offers Krsna food, Krsna directly accepts these eatables, and the devotee becomes Krsna-ized by eating the remnants.</p>

<p>And the other is for one who has not developed an attachment for the Supreme Person by transcendental love.</p>
<p>For this second class there are different prescribed rules and regulations, which one can follow to be ultimately elevated to the stage of attachment to Krsna.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga is the purification of the senses.</p>
<p>At the present moment in material existence the senses are always impure, being engaged in sense gratification.</p>
<p>But, by the practice of bhakti-yoga these senses can become purified, and in the purified state they come directly in contact with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In this material existence, I may be engaged in some service to some master, but I don't really lovingly serve my master.</p>
<p>I simply serve to get some money.</p>
<p>And the master also is not in love; he takes service from me and pays me.</p>
<p>So there is no question of love.</p>
<p>But for spiritual life, one must be elevated to the pure stage of love.</p>
<p>That stage of love can be achieved by practice of devotional service, performed with the present senses.</p>
<p>This love of God is now in a dormant state in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>And, there, love of God is manifested in different ways, but it is contaminated by the material association.</p>
<p>Now the material association has to be purified, and that dormant, natural love for Krsna has to be revived.</p>
<p>That is the whole process.</p>
<p>To practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga one should, under the guidance of an expert spiritual master, follow certain principles: one should rise early in the morning, take bath, enter the temple and offer prayers and chant Hare Krsna, then collect flowers to offer to the Deity, cook foodstuffs to offer to the Deity, take prasadam, and so on.</p>
<p>There are various rules and regulations which one should follow.</p>
<p>And one should constantly hear Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam from pure devotees.</p>
<p>This practice can help anyone to rise to the level of love of God, and then he is sure of his progress into the spiritual kingdom of God.</p>
<p>This practice of bhakti-yoga, under the rules and regulations, with the direction of a spiritual master, will surely bring one to the stage of love of God.</p>

<p>If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then just try to work for Me, because by working for Me you will come to the perfect stage.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is not able even to practice the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga, under the guidance of a spiritual master, can still be drawn to this perfectional stage by working for the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter.</p>
<p>One should be sympathetic to the propagation of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation of Krsna consciousness, and they require help.</p>
<p>So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulated principles of bhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work.</p>
<p>Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization, and labor.</p>
<p>Just as, in business, one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor, and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service of Krsna.</p>
<p>The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification.</p>
<p>The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction of Krsna, and that is spiritual activity.</p>
<p>If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagating Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Or he can help with publications.</p>
<p>There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities.</p>
<p>If one cannot sacrifice the result of such activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagate Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>This voluntary service to the cause of Krsna consciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If, however, you are unable to work in this consciousness, then try to act giving up all results of your work and try to be self-situated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It may be that one is unable to even sympathize with the activities of Krsna consciousness because of social, familial or religious considerations or because of some other impediments.</p>
<p>If one attaches himself directly to the activities of Krsna consciousness, there may be objection from family members, or so many other difficulties.</p>
<p>For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause.</p>
<p>Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules.</p>
<p>There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions of the pumundi or special work in which the result of one's previous action may be applied.</p>
<p>Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge.</p>
<p>It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities of Krsna consciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities.</p>
<p>That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one's activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understand Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Of course Krsna consciousness is not dependant on any other experience because Krsna consciousness itself can purify one's mind, but if there are impediments to Krsna consciousness, one may try to give up the result of his action.</p>
<p>In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one's country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita we find it is stated: yatah pravrttir bhutanam: If one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause is Krsna, he will come gradually to understand that Krsna is the supreme cause by the sacrificial method.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot take to this practice, then engage yourself in the cultivation of knowledge.</p>
<p>Better than knowledge, however, is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of the fruits of action, for by such renunciation one can attain peace of mind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned in the previous verses, there are two kinds of devotional service: the way of regulated principles, and the way of full attachment in love to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>For those who are actually not able to follow the principles of Krsna consciousness, it is better to cultivate knowledge because by knowledge one can be able to understand his real position.</p>
<p>Gradually knowledge will develop to the point of meditation.</p>
<p>By meditation one can be able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a gradual process.</p>
<p>There are processes which make one understand that one himself is the Supreme, and that sort of meditation is preferred if one is unable to engage in devotional service.</p>
<p>If one is not able to meditate in such a way, then there are prescribed duties, as enjoined in the Vedic literature, for the brahmanas, vaisyas, and sudras, which we shall find in a later chapter of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>But in all cases, one should give up the result or fruits of labor; this means to employ the result of karma for some good cause.</p>
<p>In summary, to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the highest goal, there are two processes: one process is by gradual development, and the other process is direct.</p>
<p>Devotional service in Krsna consciousness is the direct method, and the other method involves renouncing the fruits of one's activities.</p>
<p>Then one can come to the stage of knowledge, then to the stage of meditation, then to the stage of understanding the Supersoul, and then to the stage of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One may either take the step by step process or the direct path.</p>
<p>The direct process is not possible for everyone; therefore the indirect process is also good.</p>
<p>It is, however, to be understood that the indirect process is not recommended for Arjuna because he is already at the stage of loving devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>It is for others who are not at this state; for them the gradual process of renunciation, knowledge, meditation and realization of the Supersoul and Brahman should be followed.</p>
<p>But as far as Bhagavad-gita is concerned, it is the direct method that is stressed.</p>
<p>Everyone is advised to take to the direct method and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>

<p>One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in happiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with Me--he is very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Coming again to the point of pure devotional service, the Lord is describing the transcendental qualifications of a pure devotee in these two verses.</p>
<p>A pure devotee is never disturbed in any circumstances.</p>
<p>Nor is he envious of anyone.</p>
<p>Nor does a devotee become his enemy's enemy; he thinks that one is acting as his enemy due to his own past misdeeds.</p>
<p>Thus it is better to suffer than to protest.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated: tat te 'nukampam su-samiksyamano.</p>
<p>Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord's mercy upon him.</p>
<p>He thinks: "Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now.</p>
<p>So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due.</p>
<p>I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."</p>
<p>Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions.</p>
<p>A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy.</p>
<p>Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the peace and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body.</p>
<p>He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equiposed both in happiness and distress.</p>
<p>He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful.</p>
<p>He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled, he is determined.</p>
<p>He is not swayed by false argument because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service.</p>
<p>He is fully conscious that Krsna is the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him.</p>
<p>All his qualifications enable him to depend entirely on the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtably very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in full Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He for whom no one is put into difficulty and who is not dirturbed by anxiety, who is steady in happiness and distress, is very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A few of a devotee's qualifications are further being described.</p>
<p>No one is put into difficulty, anxiety, fearfulness, or dissatisfaction by such a devotee.</p>
<p>Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way to put others into anxiety.</p>
<p>At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he is not disturbed.</p>
<p>It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance.</p>
<p>Actually because a devotee is always engrossed in Krsna consciousness and engaged in devotional service, all such material circumstances cannot woo him.</p>
<p>Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn't, he is sorry and envious.</p>
<p>When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected.</p>
<p>But a devotee is always transcendental to all these disturbances; therefore he is very dear to Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A devotee who is not dependant on the ordinary course of activities, who is pure, expert, without cares, free from all pains, and who does not strive for some result, is very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it.</p>
<p>If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not agitated.</p>
<p>Naturally a devotee takes bath at least twice in a day and rises early in the morning for devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p>A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the sense of all activities of life, and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures.</p>
<p>A devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree.</p>
<p>He is never pained because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free.</p>
<p>The pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of devotional service.</p>
<p>For example, constructing a big building requires great energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service.</p>
<p>He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations.</p>

<p>Similarly, if he does not get what he desires, he is not distressed.</p>
<p>He is transcendental in the face of all kinds of auspicious, inauspicious and sinful activities.</p>
<p>He is prepared to accept all kinds of risks for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A devotee is always free from all bad association.</p>
<p>Sometimes one is praised and sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society.</p>
<p>But a devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness.</p>
<p>He is very patient.</p>
<p>He does not speak of anything but the topics about Krsna; therefore he is called silent.</p>
<p>Silent does not mean that one should not speak; silent means that one should not speak nonsense.</p>
<p>One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied.</p>
<p>Nor does he care for any residential facility.</p>
<p>He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither.</p>
<p>He is called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge.</p>
<p>We may find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this is just to give an illustration of the fact that a devotee must acquire all these qualifications.</p>
<p>Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee.</p>
<p>One who is not a devotee has no good qualification.</p>
<p>One who wants to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications.</p>
<p>Of course he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement in Krsna consciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop them.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>He who follows this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engages himself with faith, making Me the supreme goal, is very, very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this chapter the religion of eternal engagement, the explanation of the process of transcendental service for approaching the Supreme Lord, is given.</p>
<p>This process is very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person who is engaged in such a process.</p>
<p>The question who is better--one who is engaged in the path of impersonal Brahman or one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead--was raised by Arjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization.</p>
<p>In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association, one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization.</p>
<p>In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial.</p>
<p>In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter.</p>
<p>This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage in Krsna consciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step by step improvements in spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gita, is more congenial.</p>
<p>One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna said: O my dear Krsna, I wish to know about prakrti [nature], Purusa [the enjoyer], and the field and the knower of the field, and of knowledge and the end of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Blessed Lord then said: This body, O son of Kunti, is called the field, and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna was inquisitive about prakrti or nature, purusa, the enjoyer, ksetra, the field, ksetrajna, its knower, and of knowledge and the object of knowledge.</p>
<p>When he inquired about all these, Krsna said that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field.</p>
<p>This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord over material nature.</p>
<p>And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of activity.</p>
<p>That field of activity is the body.</p>
<p>And what is the body? The body is made of senses.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity.</p>
<p>Therefore the body is called ksetra, or the field of activity for the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>Now, the person who does not identify himself with the body is called ksetrajna, the knower of the field.</p>
<p>It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body.</p>
<p>Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining.</p>
<p>Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities.</p>
<p>A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body.</p>
<p>It is described in the beginning--dehe 'smin--that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing.</p>
<p>The owner is distinctly ksetrajna.</p>
<p>Sometimes we understand that I am happy, I am mad, I am a woman, I am a dog, I am a cat: these are the knowers.</p>
<p>The knower is different from the field.</p>
<p>Although we use many articles--our clothes, etc.--we know- that we are different from the things used.</p>
<p>Similarly, we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body.</p>
<p>In the first six chapters of Bhagavad-gita, the knower of the body, the living entity, and the position by which he can understand the Supreme Lord are described.</p>
<p>In the middle six chapters of the Gita, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the relationship between the individual soul and the Supersoul in regard to devotional service are described.</p>
<p>The superior position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the subordinate position of the individual soul are definitely defined in these chapters.</p>
<p>The living entities are subordinate under all circumstances, but in their forgetfulness they are suffering.</p>
<p>When enlightened by pious activities, they approach the Supreme Lord in different capacities--as the distressed, those in want of money, the inquisitive, and those in search of knowledge.</p>
<p>That is also described.</p>
<p>Now, starting with the Thirteenth Chapter, how the living entity comes into contact with material nature, how he is delivered by the Supreme Lord through the different methods of fruitive activities, cultivation of knowledge, and the discharge of devotional service are explained.</p>
<p>Although the living entity is completely different from the material body, he somehow becomes related.</p>
<p>This also is explained.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies, and to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge.</p>
<p>That is My opinion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>While discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter.</p>
<p>In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, Krsna says, "I am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body.</p>
<p>I am the superknower.</p>
<p>I am present in every body as the Paramatma, or Supersoul."</p>
<p>One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this Bhagavad-gita, can attain to knowledge.</p>
<p>The Lord says: "I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body."</p>
<p>The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies.</p>
<p>He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life.</p>
<p>A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens.</p>
<p>Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies.</p>
<p>The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies.</p>
<p>The body consists of the senses.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is Hrsikesa, which means controller of the senses.</p>
<p>He is the original controller of the senses, just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the citizens are secondary controllers.</p>
<p>The Lord also says: "I am also the knower."</p>
<p>This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:</p>
<p>ksetrani hi sarirani bijam capi subhasubhe tani vetti sa yogatma tatah ksetrajna ucyate.</p>
<p>This body is called the ksetra, and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord who knows both the body and the owner of the body.</p>
<p>Therefore He is called the knower of all fields.</p>
<p>The distinction between the field of activities, the owner of activities and the supreme owner of activities is described as follows.</p>
<p>Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as jnanam.</p>
<p>That is the opinion of Krsna.</p>
<p>To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge.</p>
<p>One who does not understand the field of activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge.</p>
<p>One has to understand the position of prakrti, nature, and purusa, the enjoyer of the nature, and isvara, the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul.</p>
<p>One should not confuse the three in their different capacities.</p>
<p>One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel.</p>
<p>This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is stated in the Vedic language: "bhokta bhogyam preritaram ca matva sarvam proktam tri-vidham brahmam etat."</p>
<p>There are three Brahman conceptions: prakrti is Brahman as the field of activities, and the jiva (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller.</p>
<p>In this chapter it will be also explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible.</p>
<p>One is superior and the other is subordinate.</p>
<p>One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead who states here very clearly that "I am also the knower of the field of activity."</p>
<p>One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of bodies, and there are different owners of the bodies.</p>
<p>Because each individual soul has his individual capacity of lording it over material nature, there are different bodies.</p>
<p>But the Supreme also is present in them as the controller.</p>
<p>The word ca is significant, for it indicates the total number of bodies.</p>
<p>That is the opinion of Srila Baladeva Vidyabhusana: Krsna is the Supersoul present in each and every body apart from the individual soul.</p>
<p>And Krsna explicitly says here that the Supersoul is the controller of both the field of activities and the finite enjoyer.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Now please hear My brief description of this field of activity and how it is constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of the field of activities is, and what his influences are.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is describing the field of activities and the knower of the field of activities in their constitutional positions.</p>
<p>One has to know how this body is constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this body is working, how the changes are taking place, wherefrom the changes are coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the individual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is.</p>
<p>One should also know the distinction between the individual living soul and the Supersoul, the different influences, their potentials, etc.</p>
<p>One just has to understand this Bhagavad-gita directly from the description given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all this will be clarified.</p>
<p>But one should be careful not to consider the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every body and individual soul to be the jiva.</p>
<p>This is something like equalizing the potent and the impotent.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>That knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings--especially in the Vedanta-sutra--and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the highest authority in explaining this knowledge.</p>
<p>Still, as a matter of course, learned scholars and standard authorities always give evidence from previous authorities.</p>
<p>Krsna is explaining this most controversial point regarding the duality and non-duality of the soul and the Supersoul by referring to Scriptures, the Vedanta, which are accepted as authority.</p>
<p>First, He says, this is according to different sages.</p>
<p>As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyasadeva, the author of the Vedanta-sutra, is a great sage, and in the Vedanta-sutra duality is perfectly explained.</p>
<p>And Vyasadeva's father, Parasara, was also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity: "aham tvam ca athanye..." "We--you, I and various other living entities--are all transcendental, although in material bodies.</p>
<p>Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our different karma.</p>
<p>As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature.</p>
<p>The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities.</p>
<p>But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental."</p>
<p>Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in the Katha Upanisad.</p>
<p>There is a manifestation of the Supreme Lord's energy known as annamaya by which one depends simply upon food for existence.</p>
<p>This is a materialistic realization of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Then there is pranamaya; this means that after realizing the Supreme Absolute Truth in foodstuff, one can realize the Absolute Truth in the living symptoms, or life forms.</p>
<p>In jnanamaya the living symptom develops to the point of thinking, feeling, and willing.</p>
<p>Then there is Brahman realization and the realization called vijnanamaya by which the living entity's mind and life symptoms are distinguished from the living entity himself.</p>
<p>The next and supreme stage is anandamaya, realization of the all-blissful nature.</p>
<p>Thus there are five stages of Brahman realization, which is called brahma puccham.</p>
<p>Out of these the first three--annamaya, pranamaya, and jnanamaya--involve the fields of activities of the living entities.</p>
<p>Transcendental to all these fields of activities is the Supreme Lord, who is called anandamaya.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutra also the Supreme is called anandamayo 'bhyasat.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is by nature full of joy, and to enjoy His transcendental bliss, He expands into vijnanamaya, pranamaya, jnanamaya, and annamaya.</p>
<p>In this field of activities the living entity is considered to be the enjoyer, and different from him is the anandamaya.</p>
<p>That means that if the living entity decides to enjoy, in dovetailing himself with the anandamaya, then he becomes perfect.</p>
<p>This is the real picture of the Supreme Lord, as supreme knower of the field, the living entity, as subordinate knower, and the nature of the field of activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifested, the ten senses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hatred, happiness, distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms, and convictions--all these are considered, in summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From all the authoritative statements of the great sages, the Vedic hymns and the aphorisms of the Vedanta-sutra, the components of this world are earth, water, fire, air and ether.</p>
<p>These are the five great elements (mahabhuta).</p>
<p>Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch.</p>
<p>Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, the anus and the genitals.</p>
<p>Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within.</p>
<p>Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether.</p>
<p>Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, warmth, touch and sound.</p>
<p>Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of activity.</p>
<p>If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity.</p>
<p>Then there is desire, hatred, pleasure and pain, which are interactions, representations of the five great elements in the gross body.</p>
<p>The living symptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of the subtle body--mind, ego and intelligence.</p>
<p>These subtle elements are included within the field of activities.</p>
<p>The five great elements are a gross representation of the subtle false ego.</p>
<p>They are a representation in the material conception.</p>
<p>Consciousness is represented by intelligence, of which the unmanifested stage is the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The unmanifested three modes of material nature is called pradhana.</p>
<p>One who desires to know the twenty-four elements in detail along with their interactions should study the philosophy in more detail.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, a summary only is given.</p>
<p>The body is the representation of all these factors, and there are changes of the body, which are six in number: the body is born, it grows, it stays, it produces by-products, then begins to decay, and at the last stage it vanishes.</p>
<p>Therefore the field is a nonpermanent material thing.</p>
<p>However, the ksetrajna, the knower of the field, its proprietor, is different.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity.</p>
<p>But actually this is the real process of knowledge.</p>
<p>If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists.</p>
<p>This is not the interaction of the tenfold elements, as described before, This is actually the means to get out of it.</p>
<p>Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the tenth verse: The process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>So, if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value.</p>
<p>But, if one takes to devotional service in full Krsna consciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him.</p>
<p>The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the seventh verse, is essential.</p>
<p>Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important.</p>
<p>Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path.</p>
<p>Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense.</p>
<p>As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows: Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others.</p>
<p>The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge--who knows that he is not this body--anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless.</p>
<p>One should not be hankering after this material deception.</p>
<p>People are very anxious to be famous for their religion, and consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion, one enters into some group, which is not actually following religious principles, and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor.</p>
<p>As for actual advancement in spiritual science, one should have a test to see how far he is progressing.</p>
<p>He can judge by these items.</p>
<p>Nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body, but actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress.</p>
<p>People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life, and they perpetually suffer material pains.</p>
<p>So, unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence.</p>
<p>One should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people, so that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement.</p>
<p>That is nonviolence.</p>
<p>Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others.</p>
<p>If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge, there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others.</p>
<p>This is expected because material nature is so constituted.</p>
<p>Even a boy like Prahlada, who, only five years old, was engaged in the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion.</p>
<p>The father tried to kill him in so many ways, but Prahlada tolerated him.</p>
<p>So, for making advancement in spiritual knowledge, there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination.</p>
<p>Simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy.</p>
<p>As for acceptance of the spiritual master, that is essential, because without the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, one cannot progress in the spiritual science.</p>
<p>One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services so that he will be pleased to bestow his blessings upon the disciple.</p>
<p>Because a bona fide spiritual master is a representative of Krsna, if he bestows any blessings upon his disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without the disciple's following the regulated principles.</p>
<p>Or, the regulated principles will be easier for one who has served the spiritual master without reservation.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is essential for making advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of cleanliness: external and internal.</p>
<p>External cleanliness means taking a bath, but for internal cleanliness, one has to think of Krsna always and chant, Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>This process cleans the accumulated dust of past karma from the mind.</p>
<p>Steadiness means that one should be very determined to make progress in spiritual life.</p>
<p>Without such determination, one cannot make tangible progress.</p>
<p>And self-control means that one should not accept anything which is detrimental to the path of spiritual progress.</p>
<p>One should become accustomed to this and reject anything which is against the path of spiritual progress.</p>
<p>This is real renunciation.</p>
<p>The senses are so strong that they are always anxious to have sense gratification.</p>
<p>One should not cater to these demands, which are not necessary.</p>
<p>The senses should only be gratified to keep the body fit so that one can discharge his duty in advancing in spiritual life.</p>
<p>The most important and uncontrollable sense is the tongue.</p>
<p>If one can control the tongue, then there is every possibility of controlling the other senses.</p>
<p>The function of the tongue is to taste and to vibrate.</p>
<p>Therefore, by systematic regulation, the tongue should always be engaged in tasting the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Krsna and chanting Hare Krsna.</p>
<p>As far as the eyes are concerned, they should not be allowed to see anything but the beautiful form of Krsna.</p>
<p>That will control the eyes.</p>
<p>Similarly, the ears should be engaged in hearing about Krsna and the nose in smelling the flowers offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the process of devotional service, and it is understood here that Bhagavad-gita is simply expounding the science of devotional service.</p>
<p>Devotional service is the main and sole objective.</p>
<p>Unintelligent commentators on the Gita try to divert the mind of the reader to other subjects, but there is no other subject in Bhagavad-gita but devotional service.</p>
<p>False ego means accepting this body as oneself.</p>
<p>When one understands that he is not his body and is spirit soul, that is real ego.</p>
<p>Ego is there.</p>
<p>False ego is condemned, but not real ego.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature, it is said: aham brahmasmi.</p>
<p>I am Brahman, I am spirit.</p>
<p>This "I am," the sense of self, also exists in the liberated stage of self-realization.</p>
<p>This sense of "I am" is ego, but when the sense of "I am" is applied to this false body, it is false ego.</p>
<p>When the sense of self is applied to reality, that is real ego.</p>
<p>There are some philosophers who say we should give up our ego, but we cannot give up our ego because ego means identity.</p>
<p>We ought, of course, to give up the false identification with the body.</p>
<p>One should try to understand the distress of accepting birth, death, old age and disease.</p>
<p>There are descriptions in various Vedic literatures of birth.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam the world of the unborn, the child's stay in the womb of the mother, its suffering, etc., are all very graphically described.</p>
<p>It should be thoroughly understood that birth is distressful.</p>
<p>Because we forget how much distress we have suffered within the womb of the mother, we do not make any solution to the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>Similarly at the time of death, there are all kinds of sufferings, and they are also mentioned in the authoritative scriptures.</p>
<p>These should be discussed.</p>
<p>And as far as disease and old age are concerned, everyone gets practical experience.</p>
<p>No one wants to be diseased, and no one wants to become old, but there is no avoiding these.</p>
<p>Unless we have a pessimistic view of this material life, considering the distresses of birth, death, old age and disease, there is no impetus for our making advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>As for detachment from children, wife and home, it is not meant that one should have no feeling for these.</p>
<p>They are natural objects of affection, but when they are not favorable to spiritual progress, then one should not be attached to them.</p>
<p>The best process for making the home pleasant is Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If one is in full Krsna consciousness, he can make his home very happy because this process of Krsna consciousness is very easy.</p>
<p>One need only chant Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Krsna, have some discussion on books like Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, and engage oneself in Deity worship.</p>
<p>These four will make one happy.</p>
<p>One should train the members of his family in this way.</p>
<p>The family members can sit down morning and evening and chant together Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>If one can mold his family life in this way to develop Krsna consciousness, following these four principles, then there is no need to change from family life to renounced life.</p>
<p>But if it is not congenial, not favorable for spiritual advancement, then family life should be abandoned.</p>
<p>One must sacrifice everything to realize or serve Krsna, just as Arjuna did.</p>
<p>Arjuna did not want to kill his family members, but when he understood that these family members were impediments to his Krsna realization, he accepted the instruction of Krsna and fought and killed them.</p>
<p>In all cases, one should be detached from the happiness and distress of family life because in this world one can never be fully happy or fully miserable.</p>
<p>Happiness and distress are concommitant factors of material life.</p>
<p>One should learn to tolerate, as advised in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One can never restrict the coming and going of happiness and distress, so one should be detached from the materialistic way of life and be automatically equiposed in both cases.</p>
<p>Generally, when we get something desirable, we are very happy, and when we get something undesirable, we are distressed.</p>
<p>But if we are actually in the spiritual position, these things will not agitate us.</p>
<p>To reach that stage, we have to practice unbreakable devotional service; devotional service to Krsna without deviation means engaging oneself in the nine processes of devotional service, chanting, hearing, worshiping, offering respect, etc., as described in the last verse of the Ninth Chapter.</p>
<p>That process should be followed.</p>
<p>Naturally, when one is adapted to the spiritual way of life, he will not want to mix with materialistic men.</p>
<p>That would go against his grain.</p>
<p>One may test himself by seeing how far he is inclined to live in a solitary place without unwanted association.</p>
<p>Naturally a devotee has no taste for unnecessary sporting or cinema-going or enjoying some social function, because he understands that these are simply a waste of time.</p>
<p>There are many research scholars and philosophers who study sex life or some other subject, but according to Bhagavad-gita, such research work and philosophical speculation have no value.</p>
<p>That is more or less nonsensical.</p>
<p>According to Bhagavad-gita, one should make research by philosophical discretion into the nature of the soul.</p>
<p>One should make research to understand with what the self is concerned.</p>
<p>That is recommended here.</p>
<p>As far as self-realization is concerned, it is clearly stated here that bhakti-yoga is especially practical.</p>
<p>As soon as there is a question of devotion, one must consider the relationship between the Supersoul and the individual soul.</p>
<p>The individual soul and the Supersoul cannot be one, at least not in the bhakti conception, the devotional conception of life.</p>
<p>This service of the individual soul to the Supreme Soul is eternal, nityam, as is clearly stated.</p>
<p>So bhakti or devotional service is eternal.</p>
<p>One should be established in that philosophical conviction, otherwise it is only a waste of time, ignorance.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, this is explained; vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam yaj jnanam advayam.</p>
<p>"Those who are actually knowers of the Absolute Truth know that the Self is realized in three different phases as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan." (Bhag.1.2.11) Bhagavan is the last word in the realization of the Absolute Truth; therefore one should reach up to that platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus engage in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>That is perfection of knowledge.</p>
<p>Beginning from practicing humility up to the point of realization of the Supreme Truth, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, this process is just like a staircase beginning from the ground floor up to the top floor.</p>
<p>Now on this staircase there are so many people who have reached the first floor, the second or third floor, etc., but unless one reaches the top floor, which is the understanding of Krsna, he is at a lower stage of knowledge.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to compete with God and at the same time make advancement in spiritual knowledge, he will be frustrated.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated that without humility understanding is harmful.</p>
<p>To think oneself God is most puffed up.</p>
<p>Although the living entity is always being kicked by the stringent laws of material nature, still he thinks, "I am God" because of ignorance.</p>
<p>One should be humble and know that he is subordinate to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Due to rebellion against the Supreme Lord, one becomes subordinate to material nature.</p>
<p>One must know and be convinced of this truth.</p>

<p>This is beginningless, and it is subordinate to Me.</p>
<p>It is called Brahman, the spirit, and it lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord has explained the field of activities and the knower of the field.</p>
<p>He has also explained the process of knowing the knower of the field of activities.</p>
<p>Now He is explaining the knowable, both the soul and the Supersoul respectively.</p>
<p>By knowledge of the knower, both the soul and the Supersoul, one can relish the nectar of life.</p>
<p>As explained in the Second Chapter, the living entity is eternal.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed here.</p>
<p>There is no specific date at which the jiva was born.</p>
<p>Nor can anyone trace out the history of jivatma's manifestation from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore it is beginningless.</p>
<p>The Vedic literature confirms this: na jayate mrjayate va vipascit.</p>
<p>The knower of the body is never born and never dies, and he is full of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is also stated in the Vedic literature as pradhana-ksetrajna-patir gunesah.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord as the Supersoul is the chief knower of the body, and He is the master of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>In the smrti it is said: dasa-bhuto harer eva nanyasvaiva kadacana.</p>
<p>The living entities are eternally in the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed by Lord Caitanya in His teaching; therefore the description of Brahman mentioned in this verse is in relation to the individual soul, and when the word Brahman is applied to the living entity, it is to be understood that he is vijnanam brahma as opposed to ananta-brahma.</p>
<p>Ananta-brahma is the Supreme Brahman Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes and faces, and He hears everything.</p>
<p>In this way the Supersoul exists.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As the sun exists diffusing its unlimited rays, so does the Supersoul, or Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great teacher, Brahma, down to the small ants.</p>
<p>There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities.</p>
<p>All are existing in and on the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading.</p>
<p>The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere.</p>
<p>That is not possible.</p>
<p>If he thinks that although under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over, but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory.</p>
<p>This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme.</p>
<p>The Supreme is different from the individual soul.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts.</p>
<p>If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers.</p>
<p>That is His potency.</p>
<p>In the Brahma-samhita it is stated, goloka eva nivasati: although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading.</p>
<p>The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not the individual soul.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses.</p>
<p>He is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings.</p>
<p>He transcends the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all modes of material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord, although the source of all the senses of the living entities, doesn't have material senses like they have.</p>
<p>Actually, the individual souls have spiritual senses, but in condemned life they are covered with the material elements and therefore the sense activities are exhibited through matter.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord's senses are not so covered.</p>
<p>His senses are transcendental and are therefore called nirguna.</p>
<p>Guna means the material modes, but His senses are without material covering.</p>
<p>It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours.</p>
<p>Although He is the source of all our sensual activities, He has His transcendental senses which are uncontaminated.</p>
<p>This is very nicely explained in the Svetasvatara Upanisad in the verse: sarvatah pani-padam.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him.</p>
<p>That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul.</p>
<p>He has no material eyes, but He has eyes--otherwise how could He see? He sees everything, past, present and future.</p>
<p>He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: He knows everything, but no one knows Him.</p>
<p>It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs.</p>
<p>In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things.</p>
<p>But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita also confirms that when the Lord appears He appears as He is by His internal potency.</p>
<p>He is not contaminated by the material energy because He is the Lord of material energy.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature we find that His whole embodiment is spiritual.</p>
<p>He has His eternal form called sac-cid-ananda-vigraha.</p>
<p>He is full of all opulence.</p>
<p>He is the proprietor of all wealth and the owner of all energy.</p>
<p>He is the most intelligent and is full of knowledge.</p>
<p>These are some of the symptoms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is maintainer of all living entities and the witness of all activities.</p>
<p>As far as we can understand from Vedic literature, the Supreme Lord is always transcendental.</p>
<p>Although we do not see His head, face, hands, or legs, He has them, and when we are elevated to the transcendental situation then we can see the Lord's form.</p>
<p>Due to materially contaminated senses, we cannot see His form.</p>
<p>Therefore the impersonalists who are still materially affected cannot understand the Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know.</p>
<p>Although far, far away, He is also near to all.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Vedic literature we understand that Narayana, the Supreme Person, is residing both outside and inside of every living entity.</p>
<p>He is present both in the spiritual and material world.</p>
<p>Although He is far, far away, still He is near to us.</p>
<p>These are the statements of Vedic literature.</p>
<p>Asino duram vrajati sayano yati sarvatah.</p>
<p>And, because He is always engaged in transcendental bliss, we cannot understand how He is enjoying His full opulence.</p>
<p>We cannot see or understand with these material senses.</p>
<p>Therefore in the Vedic language it is said that to understand Him our material mind and senses cannot act.</p>
<p>But one who has purified his mind and senses by practicing Krsna consciousness in devotional service can see Him constantly.</p>
<p>It is confirmed in Brahma-samhita that the devotee who has developed love for the Supreme God can see Him always, without cessation.</p>
<p>And it is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (11.54) that He can be seen and understood only by devotional service.</p>

<p>Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that He devours and develops all.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord is situated in everyone's heart as the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Does that mean that He has become divided? No.</p>
<p>Actually, He is one.</p>
<p>The example is given of the sun: the sun, at the meridian, is situated in his place.</p>
<p>But if one goes for five thousand miles in all directions and asks, "Where is the sun?" everyone will say that it is shining on his head.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature this example is given to show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided.</p>
<p>Also it is said in Vedic literature that one Visnu is present everywhere by His omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons.</p>
<p>And the Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything at the time of annihilation.</p>
<p>This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the Lord said that He has come to devour all the warriors assembled at Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>He also mentions that in the form of time He devours also.</p>
<p>He is the annihilator, the killer of all.</p>
<p>When there is creation, He develops all from their original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them.</p>
<p>The Vedic hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest of all.</p>
<p>After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after annihilation, everything again returns to rest in Him.</p>
<p>These are the confirmations of Vedic hymns.</p>

<p>He is knowledge, He is the object of knowledge, and He is the goal of knowledge.</p>
<p>He is situated in everyone's heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the source of light in all luminous objects like the sun, moon, stars, etc.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature we find that in the spiritual kingdom there is no need of sun or moon because the effulgence of the Supreme Lord is there.</p>
<p>In the material world that brahmajyoti the Lord's spiritual effulgence, is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material elements; therefore in this material world we require the assistance of sun, moon, electricity, etc., for light.</p>
<p>But in the spiritual world there is no need of such things.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated in the Vedic literature that because of His luminous effulgence, everything is illuminated.</p>
<p>It is clear, therefore, that His situation is not in the material world.</p>
<p>He is situated in the spiritual world which is far, far away in the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>Aditya-varnam tamasah parastat.</p>
<p>He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world.</p>
<p>His knowledge is transcendental.</p>
<p>The Vedic literature confirms that Brahman is concentrated transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>To one who is anxious to be transferred to that spiritual world, knowledge is given by the Supreme Lord who is situated in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>One Vedic mantra says: tam ha devam atma-buddhi-prakasam mumuksur vai saranam aham prapadye.</p>
<p>One must surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he at all wants liberation.</p>
<p>As far as the goal of ultimate knowledge is concerned, it is also confirmed in Vedic literature: tam eva viditvatimrtyum eti.</p>
<p>"Only by knowing You can one surpass the boundary of birth and death."</p>
<p>He is situated in everyone's heart as the supreme controller.</p>
<p>The Supreme has legs and hands distributed everywhere, and this cannot be said of the individual soul.</p>
<p>Therefore that there are two knowers of the field of activity, the individual soul and the Supersoul, must be admitted.</p>
<p>One's hands and legs are distributed locally, but Krsna's hands and legs are distributed everywhere.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Svetasvatara Upanisad: sarvasya prabhum isanam sarvasya saranam brhat.</p>
<p>That Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, is the prabhu or master of all living entities; therefore He is the ultimate center of all living entities.</p>
<p>So there is no denying the fact that the Supreme Supersoul and the individual soul are always different.</p>

<p>The Lord has described in summary the body, knowledge and the knowable.</p>
<p>This knowledge is of three things: the knower, the knowable and the process of knowing.</p>

<p>Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness to Krsna's activities and realize that Krsna is everything, then we attain real knowledge.</p>

<p>Material nature and the living entities should be understood to be beginningless.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By this knowledge, the body, the field of activities and the knowers of the body (both the individual soul and the Supersoul) can be known.</p>
<p>The body is the field of activity and is composed of material nature.</p>
<p>It is the individual soul which is embodied.</p>
<p>Enjoying the activities of the body is the purusa, or the living entity.</p>
<p>He is one knower, and the other is the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Of course, it is to be understood that both the Supersoul and the individual entity are different manifestations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The living entity is in the category of His energy, and the Supersoul is in the category of His personal expansion.</p>
<p>Both material nature and the living entity are eternal.</p>
<p>That is to say that they existed before the creation.</p>
<p>The material manifestation is from the energy of the Supreme Lord and so also are the living entities, but they are of the superior energy.</p>
<p>Both of them existed before this cosmos was manifested.</p>
<p>Material nature was absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Maha-Visnu, and when it was required, it was manifested by the agency of mahat-tattva.</p>
<p>Similarly, the living entities are also in Him, and because they are conditioned, they are adverse to serving the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Thus they are not allowed to enter into the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>After the winding up of material nature, these living entities are again given a chance to act in the material world and prepare themselves to enter into the spiritual world.</p>
<p>That is the mystery of this material creation.</p>
<p>Actually the living entity is originally the spiritual part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but due to his rebellious nature, he is conditioned within material nature.</p>
<p>It really does not matter how these living entities or superior entities of the Supreme Lord have come in contact with material nature.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead knows, however, how and why this actually took place.</p>
<p>In the scriptures the Lord says that those attracted by this material nature are undergoing a hard struggle for existence.</p>
<p>But we should know it with certainty from the descriptions of these few verses that all the transformations and influences of material nature by the three modes are also productions of material nature.</p>
<p>All transformations and variety in respect to living entities are due to the body.</p>
<p>As far as spirit is concerned, living entities are all the same.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects, whereas the living entity is the cause of the various sufferings and enjoyments in this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature.</p>
<p>There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are the creation of the material nature.</p>
<p>They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that.</p>
<p>When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress.</p>
<p>His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is.</p>
<p>In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state.</p>
<p>Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world there is no such thing.</p>
<p>The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire victims who present different pleasures to the body.</p>
<p>It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses.</p>
<p>The senses are instruments for gratifying desire.</p>
<p>Now, the sum total--body and instrument senses--are offered by material nature, and, as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity.</p>
<p>According to one's desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters.</p>
<p>The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering.</p>
<p>Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature.</p>
<p>At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law.</p>
<p>Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog.</p>
<p>As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog.</p>
<p>He cannot act otherwise.</p>
<p>And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body.</p>
<p>This is the law of nature.</p>
<p>But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul.</p>
<p>That is explained in the Vedas as follows: dva suparna sayuja sakhaya.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul or Paramatma.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>This is due to his association with that material nature.</p>
<p>Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is very important for an understanding of how the living entities transmigrate from one body to another.</p>
<p>It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress.</p>
<p>This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence.</p>
<p>As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another.</p>
<p>Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances.</p>
<p>Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug.</p>
<p>This is going on.</p>
<p>And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature.</p>
<p>How he is put into such different bodies is explained here.</p>
<p>It is due to association with the different modes of nature.</p>
<p>One has to rise, therefore, above the three material modes and become situated in the transcendental position.</p>
<p>That is called Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Unless one is situated in Krsna consciousness, his material consciousness will oblige him to transfer from one body to another because he has material desires since time immemorial.</p>
<p>But he has to change that conception.</p>
<p>That change can be effected only by hearing from authoritative sources.</p>
<p>The best example is here: Arjuna is hearing the science of God from Krsna.</p>
<p>The living entity, if he submits to this hearing process, will lose his long-cherished desire to dominate material nature, and gradually and proportionately, as he reduces his long desire to dominate, he comes to enjoy spiritual happiness.</p>
<p>In a Vedic mantra it is said that as he becomes learned in association with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he proportionately relishes his eternal blissful life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Yet in this body there is another, a transcendental enjoyer who is the Lord, the supreme proprietor, who exists as the overseer and permitter, and who is known as the Supersoul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is stated here that the Supersoul, who is always with the individual soul, is the representation of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He is not an ordinary living entity.</p>
<p>Because the monist philosophers take the knower of the body to be one, they think that there is no difference between the Supersoul and the individual soul.</p>
<p>To clarify this, the Lord says that He is the representation of Paramatma in every body.</p>
<p>He is different from the individual soul; He is parah, transcendental.</p>
<p>The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer.</p>
<p>His name is Paramatma, not atma, and He is transcendental.</p>
<p>It is distinctly clear that the atma and Paramatma are different.</p>
<p>The Supersoul, the Paramatma, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not.</p>
<p>And because He is the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul's desiring material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything.</p>
<p>The individual is bhakta or the sustained, and He is bhukta or the maintainer.</p>
<p>There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend.</p>
<p>The fact is that individual living entities are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and both of them are very intimately related as friends.</p>
<p>But the living entity has the tendency to reject the sanction of the Supreme Lord and act independantly in an attempt to dominate the supreme nature, and because he has this tendency, he is called the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The living entity can be situated either in the material energy or the spiritual energy.</p>
<p>As long as he is conditioned by the material energy, the Supreme Lord, as his friend, the Supersoul, stays with him just to get him to return to the spiritual energy.</p>
<p>The Lord is always eager to take him back to the spiritual energy, but due to his minute independence, the individual entity is continually rejecting the association of spiritual light.</p>
<p>This misuse of independence is the cause of his material strife in the conditioned nature.</p>
<p>The Lord, therefore, is always giving instruction from within and from without.</p>
<p>From without He gives instructions as stated in Bhagavad-gita, and from within He tries to convince him that his activities in the material field are not conducive to real happiness.</p>
<p>"Just give it up and turn your faith toward Me.</p>
<p>Then you will be happy," He says.</p>
<p>Thus the intelligent person who places his faith in the Paramatma or the Supreme Personality of Godhead begins to advance toward a blissful eternal life of knowledge</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, the living entity and the interaction of the modes of nature is sure to attain liberation.</p>
<p>He will not take birth here again, regardless of his present position.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Clear understanding of material nature, the Supersoul, the individual soul and their interrelation makes one eligible to become liberated and turn to the spiritual atmosphere without being forced to return to this material nature.</p>
<p>This is the result of knowledge.</p>
<p>The purpose of knowledge is to understand distinctly that the living entity has by chance fallen into this material existence.</p>
<p>By his personal endeavor in association with authorities, saintly persons and a spiritual master, he has to understand his position and then revert to spiritual consciousness or Krsna consciousness by understanding Bhagavad-gita as it is explained by the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then it is certain that he will never come again into this material existence; he will be transferred into the spiritual world for a blissful eternal life of knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>That Supersoul is perceived by some through meditation, by some through the cultivation of knowledge, and by others through working without fruitive desire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord informs Arjuna that the conditioned soul can be divided into two classes as far as man's search for self-realization is concerned.</p>
<p>Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>But there are others who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called workers who have renounced fruitive results.</p>
<p>Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics.</p>
<p>In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are really capable of spiritual understanding because they understand that beyond this material nature there is the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is expanded as the Paramatma, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead.</p>
<p>Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the second class.</p>
<p>The atheistic philosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-fifth item.</p>
<p>When they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is the twenty-sixth element.</p>
<p>Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude.</p>
<p>They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally situated.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate the hatha-yoga system and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin to worship the Supreme Person upon hearing about Him from others.</p>
<p>Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth and death.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is particularly applicable to modern society because in modern society there is practically no education in spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy.</p>
<p>As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing.</p>
<p>This hearing process is very important.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya, who preached Krsna consciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources, he can progress, especially, according to Lord Caitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibration Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything.</p>
<p>The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya has said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning.</p>
<p>One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, he will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>In this verse particularly the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate.</p>
<p>Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home.</p>

<p>Both material nature and the living entity, which were existing before the creation of the cosmos, are explained in this verse.</p>
<p>Whatever is created is but a combination of the living entity and material nature.</p>
<p>There are many manifestations like trees, mountains and hills, which are not moving, and there are many existences which are moving, and all of them are but combinations of material nature and superior nature, the living entity.</p>
<p>Without the touch of the superior nature, the living entity, nothing can grow.</p>
<p>Therefore the relationship between matter and nature is eternally going on, and this combination is effected by the Supreme Lord; therefore He is the controller of both the superior and inferior natures.</p>
<p>The material nature is created by Him, and the superior nature is placed in this material nature, and thus all these activities and manifestations take place.</p>

<p>After the destruction of the body, both the soul and the Supersoul exist, and they go on eternally in many various moving and unmoving forms.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O son of Bharata, as the sun alone illuminates all this universe, so does the living entity, one within the body, illuminate the entire body by consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are various theories regarding consciousness.</p>
<p>Here in Bhagavad-gita the example of the sun and the sunshine is given.</p>
<p>As the sun is situated in one place, but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by consciousness.</p>
<p>Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun.</p>
<p>When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body, there is no more consciousness.</p>
<p>This can be easily understood by any intelligent man.</p>
<p>Therefore consciousness is not a production of the combinations of matter.</p>
<p>It is the symptom of the living entity.</p>
<p>The consciousness of the living entity, although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body.</p>
<p>But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all bodies.</p>
<p>That is the difference between supreme consciousness and individual consciousness.</p>

<p>One who knowingly sees this difference between the body and the owner of the body and can understand the process of liberation from this bondage, also attains to the supreme goal.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The purport of this Thirteenth Chapter is that one should know the distinction between the body, the owner of the body, and the Supersoul.</p>
<p>A faithful person should at first have some good association to hear of God and thus gradually become enlightened.</p>
<p>If one accepts a spiritual master, he can learn to distinguish between matter and spirit, and that becomes the steppingstone for further spiritual realization.</p>
<p>A spiritual master teaches his students to get free from the material concept of life by various instructions.</p>
<p>For instance, in Bhagavad-gita we find Krsna instructing Arjuna to free him from materialistic considerations.</p>
<p>One can understand that this body is matter; it can be analyzed with its twenty-four elements.</p>
<p>That is the gross manifestation.</p>
<p>And the subtle manifestation is the mind and psychological effects.</p>
<p>And the symptoms of life are the interaction of these features.</p>
<p>But over and above this, there is the soul, and there is also the Supersoul.</p>
<p>The soul and the Supersoul are two.</p>
<p>This material world is working by the conjunction of the soul and the twenty-four material elements.</p>
<p>One who can see the constitution of the whole material manifestation as this combination of the soul and material elements and also can see the situation of the Supreme Soul becomes eligible for transfer to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>These things are meant for contemplation and for realization, and one should have a complete understanding of this chapter with the help of the spiritual master.</p>

<p>The Blessed Lord said: Again I shall declare to you this supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge, knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the Seventh Chapter to the end of the Twelfth Chapter, Sri Krsna in detail reveals the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Now, the Lord Himself is further enlightening Arjuna.</p>
<p>If one understands this chapter through the process of philosophical speculation, he will come to an understanding of devotional service.</p>
<p>In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material entanglement.</p>
<p>It has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world.</p>
<p>Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation.</p>
<p>The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters.</p>
<p>By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attain perfection and transfer to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way.</p>
<p>This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attain perfection.</p>
<p>Thus it is expected that one who understands this Fourteenth Chapter will attain perfection.</p>

<p>By becoming fixed in this knowledge, one can attain to the transcendental nature, which is like My own nature.</p>
<p>Thus established, one is not born at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After acquiring perfect transcendental knowledge, one acquires qualitative equality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, becoming free from the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>One does not, however, lose his identity as an individual soul.</p>
<p>It is understood from Vedic literature that the liberated souls who have reached the transcendental planets of the spiritual sky always look to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, being engaged in His transcendental loving service.</p>
<p>So, even after liberation, the devotees do not lose their individual identities.</p>
<p>Generally, in the material world, whatever knowledge we get is contaminated by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>But knowledge which is not contaminated by the three modes of nature is called transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>As soon as one is situated in that transcendental knowledge, he is on the same platform as that of the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Those who have no knowledge of the spiritual sky hold that after being freed from the material activities of the material form, this spiritual identity becomes formless, without any variegatedness.</p>
<p>However, just as there is material variegatedness in this world, so, in the spiritual world, there is also variegatedness.</p>
<p>Those in ignorance of this think that spiritual existence is opposed to material variety.</p>
<p>But actually, in the spiritual sky, one attains spiritual form.</p>
<p>There are spiritual activities, and the spiritual situation is called devotional life.</p>
<p>That atmosphere is said to be uncontaminated, and there one is equal in quality with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>To obtain such knowledge, one must develop all the spiritual qualities.</p>
<p>One who thus develops the spiritual qualities is not affected either by the creation or the destruction of the material world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The total material substance, called Brahman, is the source of birth, and it is that Brahman that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings, O son of Bharata.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is an explanation of the world: everything that takes place is due to the combination of ksetra and ksetrajna, the body and the spirit soul.</p>
<p>This combination of material nature and the living entity is made possible by the Supreme God Himself.</p>
<p>The mahat-tattva is the total cause of the total cosmic manifestation, and because in the total substance of the material cause there are three modes of nature, it is sometimes called Brahman.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality impregnates that total substance, and thus innumerable universes become possible.</p>
<p>This total material substance, the mahat-tattva, is described as Brahman in the Vedic literature: tasmad etad brahma nama-rupam annam ca jayate.</p>
<p>Into that Brahman the seeds of the living entities are impregnated by the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>The twenty-four elements, beginning from earth, water, fire and air, are all material energy, called Maha-brahman, or the great Brahman, the material nature.</p>
<p>As is explained in the Seventh Chapter, beyond this there is another, superior nature--the living entity.</p>
<p>In material nature the superior nature is mixed by the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thereafter all living entities are born of this material nature.</p>
<p>The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice, and sometimes it is said that the scorpion is born out of rice.</p>
<p>But the rice is not the cause of the scorpion.</p>
<p>Actually, the eggs were laid by the mother.</p>
<p>Similarly, material nature is not the cause of the birth of the living entities.</p>
<p>The seed is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they only seem to come out as products of material nature.</p>
<p>Thus every living entity, according to his past activities, has a different body, created by this material nature, and the entity can enjoy or suffer according to his past deeds.</p>
<p>The Lord is the cause of all the manifestations of living entities in this material world.</p>

<p>In this verse it is clearly explained that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the original father of all living entities.</p>

<p>Such living entities are seen not only on this planet, but in every planet, even in the highest where Brahma is situated.</p>

<p>The living entity, because he is transcendental, has nothing to do with this material nature.</p>

<p>Because living entities have different kinds of bodies, in terms of the different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O sinless one, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating, and it frees one from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Those situated in that mode develop knowledge, but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types.</p>
<p>One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless.</p>
<p>All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities' conditioned status in nature.</p>
<p>How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The mode of goodness is first considered.</p>
<p>The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned.</p>
<p>A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge.</p>
<p>The representative type is the brahmana, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness.</p>
<p>The difficulty here is that when a living entity is situated in the mode of goodness, he becomes conditioned to feel that he is advanced in knowledge and is better than others.</p>
<p>In this way he becomes conditioned.</p>
<p>The best examples are the scientist and philosopher: each is very proud of his knowledge, and because they generally improve their living conditions, they feel a sort of material happiness.</p>
<p>This sense of advanced happiness in conditioned life makes them bound by the mode of goodness of material nature.</p>
<p>As such, they are attracted toward working in the mode of goodness, and, as long as they have an attraction for working in that way, they have to take some type of body in the modes of nature.</p>
<p>Thus there is no likelihood of liberation, or of being transferred to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, one may become a philosopher, a scientist, or a poet, and, repeatedly, become entangled in the same disadvantages of birth and death.</p>
<p>But, due to the illusion of the material energy, one thinks that that sort of life is pleasant.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunti, and because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman.</p>
<p>Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman.</p>
<p>This is called the mode of passion.</p>
<p>And, when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>He wants to enjoy sense gratification.</p>
<p>For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife, and house.</p>
<p>These are the products of the mode of passion.</p>
<p>As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard.</p>
<p>Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities.</p>
<p>In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work.</p>
<p>Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion.</p>
<p>Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of the mode of passion.</p>
<p>Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what of those who are entangled in the mode of passion?</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O son of Bharata, the mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living entities.</p>
<p>The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep, which bind the conditioned soul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the specific application of the word tu is very significant.</p>
<p>This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul.</p>
<p>This mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite.</p>
<p>Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what.</p>
<p>Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded.</p>
<p>The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand the thing as it is.</p>
<p>For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died, and therefore he will also die; man is mortal.</p>
<p>The children that he conceives will also die.</p>
<p>So death is sure.</p>
<p>Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit.</p>
<p>This is madness.</p>
<p>In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Such people are very lazy.</p>
<p>When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested.</p>
<p>They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion.</p>
<p>Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required.</p>
<p>Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day.</p>
<p>Such a man appears to be always dejected, and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping.</p>
<p>These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance.</p>

<p>When the mode of goodness is prominent, passion and ignorance are defeated.</p>

<p>This competition is always going on.</p>
<p>Therefore, one who is actually intent on advancing in Krsna consciousness has to transcend these three modes.</p>
<p>The prominence of some certain mode of nature is manifested in one's dealings, in his activities, in eating, etc.</p>
<p>All this will be explained in later chapters.</p>
<p>But if one wants, he can develop, by practice, the mode of goodness and thus defeat the modes of ignorance and passion.</p>
<p>One can similarly develop the mode of passion and defeat goodness and ignorance.</p>
<p>Or, one can develop the mode of ignorance and defeat goodness and passion.</p>
<p>Although there are these three modes of material nature, if one is determined, he can be blessed by the mode of goodness, and, by transcending the mode of goodness, he can be situated in pure goodness, which is called the vasudeva state, a state in which one can understand the science of God.</p>
<p>By the manifestation of particular activities, it can be understood in what mode of nature one is situated.</p>

<p>The financier has to take much trouble to earn a mass of wealth, and those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil.</p>
<p>The miseries are there.</p>
<p>Thus Bhagavad-gita says that in any activity performed under the spell of the mode of passion, there is definitely great misery.</p>
<p>There may be a little so-called mental happiness--"I have this house or this money"--but this is not actual happiness.</p>
<p>As far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge, and therefore all his activities result in present misery, and afterwards he will go on toward animal life.</p>
<p>Animal life is always miserable, although, under the spell of the illusory energy, maya, the animals do not understand this.</p>
<p>Slaughtering poor animals is also due to the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>The animal killers do not know that in the future the animal will have a body suitable to kill them.</p>
<p>That is the law of nature.</p>
<p>In human society, if one kills a man he has to be hanged.</p>
<p>That is the law of the state.</p>
<p>Because of ignorance, people do not perceive that there is a complete state controlled by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Every living creature is the son of the Supreme Lord, and He does not tolerate even an ant's being killed.</p>
<p>One has to pay for it.</p>
<p>So, indulgence in animal killing for the taste of the tongue is the grossest kind of ignorance.</p>
<p>A human being has no need to kill animals because God has supplied so many nice things.</p>
<p>If one indulges in meat-eating anyway, it is to be understood that he is acting in ignorance and is making his future very dark.</p>
<p>Of all kinds of animal killing, the killing of cows is most vicious because the cow gives us all kinds of pleasure by supplying milk.</p>
<p>Cow slaughter is an act of the grossest type of ignorance.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature the words gobhih prinita-matsaram indicate that one who, being fully satisfied by milk, is desirous of killing the cow, is in the grossest ignorance.</p>
<p>There is also a prayer in the Vedic literature that states:</p>
<p>namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca jagaddhitaya krsnaya govindaya namo namah.</p>
<p>"My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world."</p>
<p>The purport is that special mention is given in that prayer for the protection of the cows and the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Brahmanas are the symbol of spiritual education, and cows are the symbol of the most valuable food; these two living creatures, the brahmanas and the cows, must be given all protection--that is real advancement of civilization.</p>
<p>In modern human society, spiritual knowledge is neglected, and cow killing is encouraged.</p>
<p>It is to be understood, then, that human society is advancing in the wrong direction and is clearing the path to its own condemnation.</p>
<p>A civilization which guides the citizens to become animals in their next lives is certainly not a human civilization.</p>
<p>The present human civilization is, of course, grossly misled by the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>It is a very dangerous age, and all nations should take care to provide the easiest process, Krsna consciousness, to save humanity from the greatest danger.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, grief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and illusion develop.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, Krsna consciousness is recommended.</p>
<p>Through Krsna consciousness, society will develop the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>When the mode of goodness is developed, people will see things as they are.</p>
<p>In the mode of ignorance, people are just like animals and cannot see things clearly.</p>
<p>In the mode of ignorance, for example, they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking a chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life.</p>
<p>Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible.</p>
<p>To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there.</p>
<p>When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of things as they are.</p>
<p>Then people will be happy and prosperous.</p>
<p>Even if the majority of the people aren't happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population develops Krsna consciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity all over the world.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity.</p>
<p>In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit.</p>
<p>One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangement for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind.</p>
<p>That is not possible because one is situated in the mode of passion.</p>
<p>If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicing Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One engaged in the mode of passion is not only mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome.</p>
<p>He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo.</p>
<p>This is all miserable.</p>
<p>In the mode of ignorance, people become mad.</p>
<p>Being distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance.</p>
<p>Their future in life is very dark.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets; those in the mode of passion live on the earthly planets; and those in the mode of ignorance go down to the hellish worlds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the results of actions in the three modes of nature are more explicitly set forth.</p>
<p>There is an upper planetary system, consisting of the heavenly planets, where everyone is highly elevated.</p>
<p>According to the degree of development of the mode of goodness, the living entity can be transferred to various planets in this system.</p>
<p>The highest planet is Satyaloka, or Brahmaloka, where the prime person of this universe, Lord Brahma, resides.</p>
<p>We have seen already that we can hardly calculate the wondrous condition of life in Brahmaloka, but the highest condition of life, the mode of goodness, can bring us to this.</p>
<p>The mode of passion is mixed.</p>
<p>It is in the middle, between the modes of goodness and ignorance.</p>
<p>A person is not always pure, but even if he should be purely in the mode of passion, he will simply remain on this earth as a king or a rich man.</p>
<p>But because there are mixtures, one can also go down.</p>
<p>People on this earth, in the modes of passion or ignorance, cannot forcibly approach the higher planets by machine.</p>
<p>In the mode of passion, there is also the chance of becoming mad in the next life.</p>
<p>The lowest quality, the mode of ignorance, is described here as abominable.</p>
<p>The result of developing ignorance is very, very risky.</p>
<p>It is the lowest quality in material nature.</p>
<p>Beneath the human level there are eight million species of life: birds, beasts, reptiles, trees, etc., and, according to the development of the mode of ignorance, people are brought down to these abominable conditions.</p>
<p>The word tamasah is very significant here.</p>
<p>Tamasah indicates those who stay continually in the mode of ignorance without rising to a higher mode.</p>
<p>Their future is very dark.</p>
<p>There is opportunity for men in the modes of ignorance and passion to be elevated to the mode of goodness, and that system is called Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>But one who does not take advantage of this opportunity certainly will continue in the lower modes.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all activities and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then you can know My spiritual nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls.</p>
<p>The real spiritual master is Krsna, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge to Arjuna.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is from those who are fully in Krsna consciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature.</p>
<p>Otherwise, one's life will be misdirected.</p>
<p>By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life.</p>
<p>Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities.</p>
<p>He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature.</p>
<p>Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated.</p>
<p>With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and, by such an understanding, he can become fixed in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>A man in Krsna consciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered to Krsna is relieved from the activities of material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore for one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases.</p>

<p>Although one is within this material body, by his advancement in spiritual knowledge he can be free from the influence of the modes of nature.</p>
<p>He can enjoy the happiness of spiritual life even in this body because, after leaving this body, he is certainly going to the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>But even in this body he can enjoy spiritual happiness.</p>
<p>In other words, devotional service in Krsna consciousness is the sign of liberation from this material entanglement, and this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter.</p>
<p>When one is freed from the influence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, Arjuna's questions are very appropriate.</p>
<p>He wants to know the symptoms of a person who has already transcended the material modes.</p>
<p>He first inquires of the symptoms of such a transcendental person.</p>
<p>How can one understand that he has already transcended the influence of the modes of material nature? The second question asks how he lives and what his activities are.</p>
<p>Are they regulated or nonregulated? Then Arjuna inquires of the means by which he can attain the transcendental nature.</p>
<p>That is very important.</p>
<p>Unless one knows the direct means by which one can be situated always transcendentally, there is no possibility of showing the symptoms.</p>
<p>So all these questions put by Arjuna are very important, and the Lord answers them.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: He who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present, nor longs for them when they disappear; who is seated like one unconcerned, being situated beyond these material reactions of the modes of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active; who regards alike pleasure and pain, and looks on a clod, a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye; who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same; who is unchanged in honor and dishonor, who treats friend and foe alike, who has abandoned all fruitive undertakings--such a man is said to have transcended the modes of nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna submitted the three different questions, and the Lord answers them one after another.</p>
<p>In these verses, Krsna first indicates that a person transcendentally situated neither envies anyone nor hankers for anything.</p>
<p>When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral.</p>
<p>He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten.</p>
<p>When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness to Krsna, sense gratification automatically stops.</p>
<p>One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body.</p>
<p>The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities.</p>
<p>How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it.</p>
<p>Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free.</p>
<p>He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The next question concerns the dealings of a transcendentally situated person.</p>
<p>The materially situated person is affected by so-called honor and dishonor offered to the body, but the transcendentally situated person is not affected by such false honor and dishonor.</p>
<p>He performs his duty in Krsna consciousness and does not mind whether a man honors or dishonors him.</p>
<p>He accepts things that are favorable for his duty in Krsna consciousness, otherwise he has no necessity of anything material, either a stone or gold.</p>
<p>He takes everyone as his dear friend who helps him in his execution of Krsna consciousness, and he does not hate his so-called enemy.</p>
<p>He is equally disposed and sees everything on an equal level because he knows perfectly well that he has nothing to do with material existence.</p>
<p>Social and political issues do not affect him because he knows the situation of temporary upheavals and disturbances.</p>
<p>He does not attempt anything for his own sake.</p>
<p>He can attempt anything for Krsna, but for his personal self he does not attain anything.</p>
<p>By such behavior one becomes actually transcendentally situated.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is a reply to Arjuna's third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness to Krsna activities.</p>
<p>Krsna activities are known as bhakti-yoga--always acting for Krsna.</p>
<p>This includes not only Krsna, but His different plenary expansions such as Rama and Narayana.</p>
<p>He has innumerable expansions.</p>
<p>One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms of Krsna, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated.</p>
<p>One should also note that all the forms of Krsna are fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal.</p>
<p>Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities.</p>
<p>So, if one engages himself in the service of Krsna or His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, he can overcome them easily.</p>
<p>This is already explained in the Seventh Chapter.</p>
<p>One who surrenders unto Krsna at once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>To be in Krsna consciousness or in devotional service means to acquire the equality of Krsna.</p>
<p>The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine.</p>
<p>Thus the living entity's spiritual position is as good as gold, as good as Krsna in quality.</p>
<p>The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there is no question of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga means that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there.</p>
<p>Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there is no meaning to bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications.</p>
<p>Thus the qualification is to become Brahman, or freed from all material contamination.</p>
<p>It is said in the Vedic literature: brahmaiva san brahmapyeti.</p>
<p>One can attain the Supreme Brahman by becoming Brahman.</p>
<p>This means that one must qualitatively become one with Brahman.</p>
<p>By attainment of Brahman, one does not lose his eternal Brahman identity as individual soul.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>And I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The constitution of Brahman is immortality, imperishability, eternity, and happiness.</p>
<p>Brahman is the beginning of transcendental realization.</p>
<p>Paramatma, the Supersoul, is the middle, the second stage in transcendental realization, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate realization of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Therefore, both Paramatma and the impersonal Brahman are within the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord impregnates the inferior material nature with the fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature.</p>
<p>When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to the Brahman conception of the Supreme.</p>
<p>This attainment of the Brahman conception of life is the first stage in self-realization.</p>
<p>At this stage the Brahman realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect in Brahman realization.</p>
<p>If he wants, he can continue to stay in the Brahman position and then gradually rise up to Paramatma realization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this in Vedic literature.</p>
<p>The four Kumaras were situated first in the impersonal Brahman conception of truth, but then they gradually rose to the platform of devotional service.</p>
<p>One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception of Brahman runs the risk of falling down.</p>
<p>In Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonal Brahman, without going farther, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear.</p>
<p>Therefore, in spite of being raised to the Brahman platform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the Vedic language it is also said: raso vai sah; rasam hy evayam labdhvanandi bhavati.</p>
<p>"When one understands the Personality of God, the reservoir of pleasure, Krsna, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful."</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him, there is an exchange of these six opulences.</p>
<p>The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king.</p>
<p>And so, eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, eternal life accompany devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore, realization of Brahman, or eternity, or imperishability is included in devotional service.</p>
<p>This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service.</p>
<p>The living entity, although Brahman by nature, has the desire to lord it over the material world, and due to this he falls down.</p>
<p>In his constitutional position, a living entity is above the three modes of material nature, but association with material nature entangles him in the different modes of material nature, goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Due to the association of these three modes, his desire to dominate the material world is there.</p>
<p>By engagement in devotional service in full Krsna consciousness, he is immediately situated in the transcendental position, and his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed.</p>
<p>Therefore the process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering--the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service--should be practiced in the association of devotees.</p>
<p>Gradually, by such association, by the influence of the spiritual master, one's material desire to dominate is removed, and one becomes firmly situated in the Lord's transcendental loving service.</p>
<p>This method is prescribed from the twenty-second to the last verse of this chapter.</p>
<p>Devotional service to the Lord is very simple: one should always engage in the service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Deity, smell the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, see the places where the Lord had His transcendental pastimes, read of the different activities of the Lord, His reciprocation of love with His devotees, chant always the transcendental vibration Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare, and observe the fasting days commemorating the appearances and disappearances of the Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p>By following such a process one becomes completely detached from all material activities.</p>
<p>One who can thus situate himself in the brahmajyoti is equal to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in quality.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns.</p>
<p>One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After the discussion of the importance of bhakti-yoga, one may question, "What about the Vedas?" It is explained in this chapter that the purpose of Vedic study is to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore one who is in Krsna consciousness, who is engaged in devotional service, already knows the Vedas.</p>
<p>The entanglement of this material world is compared here to a banyan tree.</p>
<p>For one who is engaged in fruitive activities, there is no end to the banyan tree.</p>
<p>He wanders from one branch to another, to another, to another.</p>
<p>The tree of this material world has no end, and for one who is attached to this tree, there is no possibility of liberation.</p>
<p>The Vedic hymns, meant for elevating oneself, are called the leaves of this tree.</p>
<p>This tree's roots grow upward because they begin from where Brahma is located, the topmost planet of this universe.</p>
<p>If one can understand this indestructible tree of illusion, then one can get out of it.</p>
<p>This process of extrication should be understood.</p>
<p>In the previous chapters it has been explained that there are many processes by which to get out of the material entanglement.</p>
<p>And, up to the Thirteenth Chapter, we have seen that devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the best way.</p>
<p>Now, the basic principle of devotional service is detachment from material activities and attachment to the transcendental service of the Lord.</p>
<p>The process of breaking attachment to the material world is discussed in the beginning of this chapter.</p>
<p>The root of this material existence grows upward.</p>
<p>This means that it begins from the total material substance, from the topmost planet of the universe.</p>
<p>From there, the whole universe is expanded, with so many branches, representing the various planetary systems.</p>
<p>The fruits represent the results of the living entities' activities, namely, religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation.</p>
<p>Now, there is no ready experience in this world of a tree situated with its branches down and its roots upward, but there is such a thing.</p>
<p>That tree can be found beside a reservoir of water.</p>
<p>We can see that the trees on the bank reflect upon the water with their branches down and roots up.</p>
<p>In other words, the tree of this material world is only a reflection of the real tree of the spiritual world.</p>
<p>This reflection of the spiritual world is situated on desire, just as the tree's reflection is situated on water.</p>
<p>Desire is the cause of things' being situated in this reflected material light.</p>
<p>One who wants to get out of this material existence must know this tree thoroughly through analytical study.</p>
<p>Then he can cut off his relationship with it.</p>
<p>This tree, being the reflection of the real tree, is an exact replica.</p>
<p>Everything is there in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>The impersonalists take Brahma to be the root of this material tree, and from the root, according to sankhya philosophy, come prakrti, purusa, then the three gunas, then the five gross elements (panca-mahabhuta), then the ten senses (dasendriya), mind, etc.</p>
<p>In this way they divide up the whole material world.</p>
<p>If Brahma is the center of all manifestations, then this material world is a manifestation of the center by 180 degrees, and the other 180 degrees constitute the spiritual world.</p>
<p>The material world is the perverted reflection, so the spiritual world must have the same variegatedness, but in reality.</p>
<p>The prakrti is the external energy of the Supreme Lord, and the purusa is the Supreme Lord Himself, and that is explained in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Since this manifestation is material, it is temporary.</p>
<p>A reflection is temporary, for it is sometimes seen and sometimes not seen.</p>
<p>But the origin from whence the reflection is reflected is eternal.</p>
<p>The material reflection of the real tree has to be cut off.</p>
<p>When it is said that a person knows the Vedas, it is assumed that he knows how to cut off attachment to this material world.</p>
<p>If one knows that process, he actually knows the Vedas.</p>
<p>One who is attracted by the ritualistic formulas of the Vedas is attracted by the beautiful green leaves of the tree.</p>
<p>He does not exactly know the purpose of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Vedas, as disclosed by the Personality of Godhead Himself, is to cut down this reflected tree and attain the real tree of the spiritual world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The twigs are the objects of the senses.</p>
<p>This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The description of the banyan tree is further explained here.</p>
<p>Its branches are spread in all directions.</p>
<p>In the lower parts, there are variegated manifestations of living entities, such as human beings, animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats, etc.</p>
<p>These are situated on the lower parts of the branches, whereas on the upper parts are higher forms of living entities: the demigods, Gandharvas (fairies), and many other higher species of life.</p>
<p>As a tree is nourished by water, so this tree is nourished by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Sometimes we find that a tract of land is barren for want of sufficient water, and sometimes a tract is very green; similarly, where the modes of material nature are proportionately greater in quantity, the different species of life are manifested in that proportion.</p>
<p>The twigs of the tree are considered to be the sense objects.</p>
<p>By development of the different modes of nature, we develop different senses, and, by the senses, we enjoy different varieties of sense objects.</p>
<p>The source of the senses--the ears, the nose, eyes, etc.--is considered to be the upper twigs, tuned to the enjoyment of different sense objects.</p>
<p>The leaves are sound, form, touch--the sense objects.</p>
<p>The roots, which are subsidiary, are the by-products of different varieties of suffering and sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Thus we develop attachment and aversion.</p>
<p>The tendencies toward piety and impiety are considered to be the secondary roots, spreading in all directions.</p>
<p>The real root is from Brahmaloka, and the other roots are in the human planetary systems.</p>
<p>After one enjoys the results of virtuous activities in the upper planetary systems, he comes down to this earth and renews his karma or fruitive activities for promotion.</p>
<p>This planet of human beings is considered the field of activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world.</p>
<p>No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is.</p>
<p>But with determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment.</p>
<p>So doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything has begun and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be understood in this material world.</p>
<p>Since the root is upwards, the extension of the real tree is at the other end.</p>
<p>No one can see how far the tree extends, nor can one see the beginning of this tree.</p>
<p>Yet one has to find out the cause.</p>
<p>"I am the son of my father, my father is the son of such and such a person, etc."</p>
<p>By searching in this way, one comes to Brahma, who is generated by the Garbhodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Finally, in this way, when one reaches to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is the end of research work.</p>
<p>One has to search out that origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the association of persons who are in the knowledge of that Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then by understanding one becomes gradually detached from this false reflection of reality, and by knowledge one can cut off the connection and actually become situated in the real tree.</p>
<p>The word asanga is very important in this connection because the attachment for sense enjoyment and lording it over the material nature is very strong.</p>
<p>Therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures, and one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge.</p>
<p>As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then the first thing one must do is surrender to Him.</p>
<p>The description of that place whence going no one returns to this false reflected tree is given here.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the original root from whom everything has emanated.</p>
<p>To gain favor of that Personality of Godhead, one has only to surrender, and this is a result of performing devotional service by hearing, chanting, etc.</p>
<p>He is the cause of this extension of this material world.</p>
<p>This is already explained by the Lord Himself: aham sarvasya prabhavah.</p>
<p>"I am the origin of everything."</p>
<p>Therefore to get out of the entanglement of this strong banyan tree of material life, one must surrender to Krsna.</p>
<p>As soon as one surrenders unto Krsna, he becomes detached automatically from this material extension.</p>

<p>One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The surrendering process is described here very nicely.</p>
<p>The first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride.</p>
<p>Because the conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord.</p>
<p>When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender.</p>
<p>For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world.</p>
<p>He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble.</p>
<p>The whole world moves under this impression.</p>
<p>People are considering that the land, this earth, belongs to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors.</p>
<p>One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world.</p>
<p>When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social, and national affections.</p>
<p>These fake associations bind one to this material world.</p>
<p>After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own.</p>
<p>And, when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity.</p>
<p>One who reaches it never returns to this material world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The spiritual world, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna--which is known as Krsnaloka, Goloka Vrndavana--is described here.</p>
<p>In the spiritual sky there is no need of sunshine, moonshine, fire or electricity, because all the planets are self-luminous.</p>
<p>We have only one planet in this universe, the sun, which is self-luminous, but all the planets in the spiritual sky are self-luminous.</p>
<p>The shining effulgence of all those planets (called Vaikunthas) constitutes the shining sky known as the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>Actually, the effulgence is emanating from the planet of Krsna, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Part of that shining effulgence is covered by the mahat-tattva, the material world.</p>
<p>Other than this, the major portion of that shining sky is full of spiritual planets, which are called Vaikunthas, chief of which is Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
<p>As long as a living entity is in this dark material world, he is in conditional life, but as soon as he reaches the spiritual sky, by cutting through the false, perverted tree of this material world, he becomes liberated.</p>
<p>Then there is no chance of his coming back here.</p>
<p>In his conditional life, the living entity considers himself to be the lord of this material world, but in his liberated state he enters into the spiritual kingdom and becomes the associate of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>There he enjoys eternal bliss, eternal life, and full knowledge.</p>
<p>One should be captivated by this information.</p>
<p>He should desire to transfer himself to that eternal world and extricate himself from this false reflection of reality.</p>
<p>For one who is too much attached to this material world, it is very difficult to cut that attachment, but if he takes to Krsna consciousness, there is a chance of gradually becoming detached.</p>
<p>One has to associate himself with devotees, those who are in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One should search out a society dedicated to Krsna consciousness and learn how to discharge devotional service.</p>
<p>In this way he can cut off his attachment to the material world.</p>
<p>One cannot become detached from the attraction of the material world simply by dressing himself in saffron cloth.</p>
<p>He must become attached to the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore one should take it very seriously that devotional service as described in the Twelfth Chapter is the only way to get out of this false representation of the real tree.</p>
<p>In Chapter Fourteen the contamination of all kinds of processes by material nature is described.</p>
<p>Only devotional service is described as purely transcendental.</p>
<p>The words paramam mama are very important here.</p>
<p>Actually every nook and corner is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the spiritual world is paramam, full of six opulences.</p>
<p>In the Upanisads it is also confirmed that in the spiritual world there is no need of sunshine or moonshine, for the whole spiritual sky is illuminated by the internal potency of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>That supreme abode can be achieved only by surrender and by no other means.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.</p>
<p>Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the identity of the living being is clearly given.</p>
<p>The living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord--eternally.</p>
<p>It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He is eternally fragmented.</p>
<p>It is clearly said, sanatanah.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are called Visnu-tattva, and the secondary expansions are called the living entities.</p>
<p>In other words, the Visnu-tattva is the personal expansion, and the living entities are separated expansions.</p>
<p>By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like Lord Rama, Nrsimhadeva, Visnumurti and all the predominating Deities in the Vaikuntha planets.</p>
<p>The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors.</p>
<p>The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present.</p>
<p>Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities.</p>
<p>As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities have also fragmental qualities, of which independence is one.</p>
<p>Every living entity has an individual soul, his personal individuality and a minute form of independence.</p>
<p>By misuse of that independence, one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated.</p>
<p>In either case, he is qualititatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is.</p>
<p>In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world.</p>
<p>The living entities, not only the human beings and the cats and dogs, but even the greater controllers of the material world--Brahma, Lord Siva, and even Visnu--are all parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>They are all eternal, not temporary manifestations.</p>
<p>The word karsati (struggling or grappling hard) is very significant.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul is bound up, as though shackled by iron chains.</p>
<p>He is bound up by the false ego, and the mind is the chief agent which is driving him in this material existence.</p>
<p>When the mind is in the mode of goodness, his activities are good; when the mind is in the mode of passion, his activities are troublesome; and when the mind is in the mode of ignorance, he travels in the lower species of life.</p>
<p>It is clear, however, in this verse, that the conditioned soul is covered by the material body, with the mind and the senses, and when he is liberated this material covering perishes, but his spiritual body manifests in its individual capacity.</p>
<p>The following information is there in the Madhyandi-nayana-sruti: sa va esa brahma-nistha idam sariram marttyam atisrjya brahmabhisampadya brahmana pasyati brahmana srnoti brahmanaivedam sarvam anubhavati.</p>
<p>It is stated here that when a living entity gives up this material embodiment and enters into the spiritual world, he revives his spiritual body, and in his spiritual body he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.</p>
<p>He can hear and speak to Him face to face, and he can understand the Supreme Personality as He is.</p>
<p>In smrti also it is understood that in the spiritual planets everyone lives in bodies featured like the Supreme Personality of Godhead's.</p>
<p>As far as bodily construction is concerned, there is no difference between the part and parcel living entities and the expansions of Visnumurti.</p>
<p>In other words, at liberation the living entity gets a spiritual body by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The word mamaivamsah (fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord) is also very significant.</p>
<p>The fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is not like some material broken part.</p>
<p>We have already understood in the Second Chapter that the spirit cannot be cut into pieces.</p>
<p>This fragment is not materially conceived.</p>
<p>It is not like matter which can be cut into pieces and joined together again.</p>
<p>That conception is not applicable here because the Sanskrit word sanatana (eternal) is used.</p>
<p>The fragmental portion is eternal.</p>
<p>It is also stated in the beginning of the Second Chapter that (dehino 'smin yatha) in each and every individual body, the fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord is present.</p>
<p>That fragmental portion, when liberated from the bodily entanglement, revives its original spiritual body in the spiritual sky in a spiritual planet and enjoys association with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>It is, however, understood here that the living entity, being the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, is qualitatively one, just as the parts and parcels of gold are also gold.</p>

<p>It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life.</p>

<p>This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from Bhagavad-gita and similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate.</p>
<p>Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances; he is living under certain circumstances and enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature.</p>
<p>As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power of understanding their change of body and their stay in a particular body.</p>
<p>They cannot comprehend it.</p>
<p>Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways.</p>
<p>A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence.</p>
<p>Therefore those who are highly developed in Krsna consciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome.</p>
<p>They should come out of it and be Krsna conscious and liberate themselves to transfer to the spiritual world.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many transcendentalists in the path of spiritual self-realization, but one who is not situated in self-realization cannot see how things are changing in the body of the living entity.</p>
<p>The word yoginah is significant in this connection.</p>
<p>In the present day there are many so-called yogis, and there are many so-called associations of yogis, but they are actually blind in the matter of self-realization.</p>
<p>They are simply addicted to some sort of gymnastic exercise and are satisfied if the body is well-built and healthy.</p>
<p>They have no other information.</p>
<p>They are called yatanto 'py akrtatmanah.</p>
<p>Even though they are endeavoring in a so-called yoga system, they are not self-realized.</p>
<p>Such people cannot understand the process of the transmigration of the soul.</p>
<p>Only those who are actually in the yoga system and have realized the self, the world, and the Supreme Lord, in other words, the bhakti-yogis, those engaged in pure devotional service in Krsna consciousness, can understand how things are taking place.</p>

<p>The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me.</p>
<p>And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The unintelligent cannot understand how things are taking place.</p>
<p>The beginning of knowledge can be established by understanding what the Lord explains here.</p>
<p>Everyone sees the sun, moon, fire and electricity.</p>
<p>One should simply try to understand that the splendor of the sun, the splendor of the moon, and the splendor of electricity or fire are coming from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In such a conception of life, the beginning of Krsna consciousness, lies a great deal of advancement for the conditioned soul in this material world.</p>
<p>The living entities are essentially the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, and He is giving herewith the hint how they can come back to Godhead, back to home.</p>
<p>From this verse we can understand that the sun is illuminating the whole solar system.</p>
<p>There are different universes and solar systems, and there are different suns, moons and planets also.</p>
<p>Sunlight is due to the spiritual effulgence in the spiritual sky of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>With the rise of the sun, the activities of human beings are set up.</p>
<p>They set fire to prepare their foodstuff; they set fire to start the factories, etc.</p>
<p>So many things are done with the help of fire.</p>
<p>Therefore sunrise, fire and moonlight are so pleasing to the living entities.</p>
<p>Without their help no living entity can live.</p>
<p>So if one can understand that the light and splendor of the sun, moon and fire are emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, then one's Krsna consciousness will begin.</p>
<p>By the moonshine, all the vegetables are nourished.</p>
<p>The moonshine is so pleasing that people can easily understand that they are living by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna.</p>
<p>Without His mercy there cannot be sun, without His mercy there cannot be moon, and without His mercy there cannot be fire, and without the help of sun, moon and fire, no one can live.</p>
<p>These are some thoughts to provoke Krsna consciousness in the conditioned soul.</p>

<p>I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit.</p>
<p>I become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living being.</p>
<p>That is discussed in the Brahma-samhita.</p>
<p>It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom.</p>
<p>So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested.</p>
<p>When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, it sinks.</p>
<p>Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water.</p>
<p>Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust.</p>
<p>If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust falling, but if one throws it in the air, it will fall down.</p>
<p>Similarly, these planets, which are floating in air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>By His strength and energy, all moving and unmoving things stay in their place.</p>
<p>It is said that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving.</p>
<p>Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables.</p>
<p>Due to the moon's influence, the vegetables become delicious.</p>
<p>Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent.</p>
<p>Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Otherwise, mankind could not survive.</p>
<p>The word rasatmakah is very significant.</p>
<p>Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the influence of the moon.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life, outgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Ayur-vedic sastra, we understand that there is a fire in the stomach which digests all food sent there.</p>
<p>When the fire is not blazing, there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order, we become hungry.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required.</p>
<p>In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Vedic mantras also confirm that the Supreme Lord or Brahman is situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff.</p>
<p>Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independant in the eating process.</p>
<p>Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating.</p>
<p>He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and, by His grace, we are enjoying life.</p>
<p>In the Vedanta-sutra this is also confirmed: sabdadibhyo 'ntah pratisthanac ca.</p>
<p>The Lord is situated within sound and within the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force.</p>
<p>There are four kinds of foodstuff: some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are licked up, and some are sucked, and He is the digestive force for all of them.</p>

<p>I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramatma in everyone's heart, and it is from Him that all activities are initiated.</p>
<p>The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work.</p>
<p>Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds.</p>
<p>Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life.</p>
<p>Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart.</p>
<p>He awards the different fruitive results.</p>
<p>He is not only worshipable as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localized Paramatma, but as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well.</p>
<p>The Vedas give the right direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home.</p>
<p>The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and Krsna in His incarnation as Vyasadeva is the compiler of the Vedanta-sutra.</p>
<p>The commentation on the Vedanta-sutra by Vyasadeva in the Srimad-Bhagavatam gives the real understanding of Vedanta-sutra.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, the teacher of the Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>He is worshipable by the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful.</p>
<p>Antahpravistah sasta jananam.</p>
<p>The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again, initiated by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life.</p>
<p>So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand Vedas from Him.</p>
<p>If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then Krsna gives the required intelligence.</p>
<p>Why does He present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>Vedic literature confirms this: yo 'sau sarvair vedair giyate.</p>
<p>In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four Vedas, Vedanta-sutra and the Upanisads and Puranas, the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated.</p>
<p>By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained.</p>
<p>Therefore the purpose of the Vedas is to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>The Vedas give us direction to understand Krsna and the process of understanding.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Vedanta-sutra confirms this in the following words: tat tu samanvayat.</p>
<p>One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes.</p>
<p>Thus one can approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In this verse, however, the purpose of the Vedas, the understanding of the Vedas and the goal of Vedas are clearly defined.</p>

<p>There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible.</p>
<p>In the material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity is called infallible.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As already explained, the Lord in His incarnation as Vyasadeva compiled the Vedanta-sutra.</p>
<p>Here the Lord is giving, in summary, the contents of the Vedanta-sutra: He says that the living entities, who are innumerable, can be divided into two classes--the fallible and the infallible.</p>
<p>The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When they are in contact with the material world, they are called jiva-bhutah, and the Sanskrit words given here, sarvani bhutani mean that they are fallible.</p>
<p>Those who are in oneness with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, are called infallible.</p>
<p>Oneness does not mean that they have no individuality, but that there is no disunity.</p>
<p>They are all agreeable to the purpose of the creation.</p>
<p>Of course, in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as creation, but since the Supreme Personality of Godhead has stated in the Vedanta-sutra that He is the source of all emanations, that conception is explained.</p>
<p>According to the statement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna, there are two classes of men.</p>
<p>The Vedas give evidence of this, so there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>The living entities, who are struggling in this world with the mind and five senses, have their material bodies which are changing as long as the living entities are conditioned.</p>
<p>One's body changes due to contact with matter; matter is changing, so the living entity appears to be changing.</p>
<p>But in the spiritual world the body is not made of matter; therefore there is no change.</p>
<p>In the material world the living entity undergoes six changes--birth, growth, duration, reproduction, then dwindling and vanishing.</p>
<p>These are the changes of the material body.</p>
<p>But in the spiritual world the body does not change; there is no old age, there is no birth, there is no death.</p>
<p>There all exists in oneness.</p>
<p>It is more clearly explained as sarvani bhutani: any living entity who has come in contact with matter, beginning from the first created being, Brahma, down to a small ant, is changing its body; therefore they are all fallible.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, however, they are always liberated in oneness.</p>

<p>Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Lord Himself, who has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse is very nicely expressed in the Katha Upanisad and Svetasvatara Upanisad.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated there that above the innumerable living entities, some of whom are conditioned and some of whom are liberated, there is the Supreme Personality who is Paramatma.</p>
<p>The Upanisadic verse runs as follows: nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam.</p>
<p>The purport is that amongst all the living entities, both conditioned and liberated, there is one supreme living personality, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who maintains them and gives them all the facility of enjoyment according to different work.</p>
<p>That Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone's heart as Paramatma.</p>
<p>A wise man who can understand Him is eligible to attain the perfect peace, not others.</p>
<p>It is incorrect to think of the Supreme Lord and the living entities as being on the same level or equal in all respects.</p>
<p>There is always the question of superiority and inferiority in their personalities.</p>
<p>This particular word uttama is very significant.</p>
<p>No one can surpass the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Loke is also significant because in the Paurusa, a Vedic literature, it is stated: lokyate vedartho 'nena.</p>
<p>This Supreme Lord in His localized aspect as Paramatma explains the purpose of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The following verse also appears in the Vedas:</p>
<p>tavad esa samprasado 'smac charirat samutthaya param jyoti-rupam sampadya svena rupenabhinispadyate sa uttamah purusah</p>
<p>"The Supersoul coming out of the body enters the impersonal brahmajyoti; then in His form He remains in His spiritual identity.</p>
<p>That Supreme is called the Supreme Personality."</p>
<p>This means that the Supreme Personality is exhibiting and diffusing His spiritual effulgence, which is the ultimate illumination.</p>
<p>That Supreme Personality also has a localized aspect as Paramatma.</p>
<p>By incarnating Himself as the son of Satyavati and Parasara, He explains the Vedic knowledge as Vyasadeva.</p>

<p>Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to be understood as the knower of everything, and he therefore engages himself in full devotional service, O son of Bharata</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many philosophical speculations about the constitutional position of the living entities and the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Now in this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead clearly explains that anyone who knows Lord Krsna as the Supreme Person is actually the knower of everything.</p>
<p>The imperfect knower goes on simply speculating about the Absolute Truth, but the perfect knower, without wasting his valuable time, engages directly in Krsna consciousness, the devotional service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of Bhagavad-gita, this fact is being stressed at every step.</p>
<p>And still there are so many stubborn commentators on Bhagavad-gita who consider the Supreme Absolute Truth and the living entities to be one and the same.</p>
<p>Vedic knowledge is called sruti learning by aural reception.</p>
<p>One should actually receive the Vedic message from authorities like Krsna and His representatives.</p>
<p>Here Krsna distinguishes everything very nicely, and one should hear from this source.</p>
<p>Simply to hear like the hogs is not sufficient; one must be able to understand from the authorities.</p>
<p>It is not that one should simply speculate academically.</p>
<p>One should submissively hear from Bhagavad-gita that these living entities are always subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Anyone who is able to understand this, according to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, knows the purpose of the Vedas; no one else knows the purpose of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The word bhajate is very significant.</p>
<p>In many places the word bhajate is expressed in relationship with the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>If a person is engaged in full Krsna consciousness in devotional service of the Lord, it is to be understood that he has understood all the Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>In the Vaisnava parampara it is said that if one is engaged in the devotional service of Krsna, then there is no need for a spiritual process to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>He has already come to the post because he is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He has ended all preliminary processes of understanding; similarly, if anyone, after speculating for hundreds of thousands of lives, does not come to the point that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that one has to surrender there, all his speculation for so many years and lives is a useless waste of time.</p>

<p>This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me.</p>
<p>Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures.</p>
<p>And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist.</p>
<p>Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual--the internal energy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness.</p>
<p>Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness.</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.</p>
<p>Everyone must take to this consciousness of Krsna and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified.</p>
<p>Unless one comes to this position of understanding Krsna and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.</p>
<p>The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant.</p>
<p>Anagha, O sinless one, means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions, it is very difficult to understand Krsna.</p>
<p>One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand.</p>
<p>But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness.</p>
<p>While performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full Krsna consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether.</p>
<p>The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart.</p>
<p>The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature.</p>
<p>Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity of lording it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter.</p>
<p>The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one's existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor--these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter, the banyan tree of this material world was explained.</p>
<p>The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious.</p>
<p>In the Ninth Chapter, also, the devas, or godly, and the asuras, the ungodly, or demons, were explained.</p>
<p>Now, according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as deva prakrti, transcendental by nature.</p>
<p>Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation.</p>
<p>For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation.</p>
<p>Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms.</p>
<p>In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities, as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities.</p>
<p>He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities.</p>
<p>The word abhijatasya in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant.</p>
<p>To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as Garbhadhana-samskara.</p>
<p>If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>Sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Those who are in Krsna consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become Krsna conscious after birth.</p>
<p>That should be the advantage of children born of a father or mother absorbed in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The social institution known as varnasrama-dharma--the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes--is not meant to divide human society according to birth.</p>
<p>Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications.</p>
<p>They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world.</p>
<p>In the varnasrama institution the sannyasi, or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders.</p>
<p>A brahmana is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of a society, namely, the ksatriyas, the vaisyas and the sudras, but a sannyasi, who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the brahmanas also.</p>
<p>For a sannyasi, the first qualification should be fearlessness.</p>
<p>Because a sannyasi has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If he thinks, "After leaving my connections, who will protect me?" he should not accept the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>One must be fully convinced that Krsna or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramatma is always within, that He is seeing everything and He always knows what one intends to do.</p>
<p>One must thus have firm conviction that Krsna as Paramatma will take care of a soul surrendered to Him.</p>
<p>"I shall never be alone," one should think.</p>
<p>"Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest I shall be accompanied by Krsna, and He will give me all protection."</p>
<p>That conviction is called abhayam, without fear.</p>
<p>This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>Then he has to purify his existence.</p>
<p>There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>Most important of all, a sannyasi is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman.</p>
<p>He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya was an ideal sannyasi, and when He was at Puri His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects.</p>
<p>They were advised to bow down from a distant place.</p>
<p>This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on the sannyasi not to have close connections with women.</p>
<p>One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence.</p>
<p>For a sannyasi, intimate relations with women and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden.</p>
<p>The ideal sannyasi was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women.</p>
<p>Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the sannyasa order of the life in connection with association with woman.</p>
<p>One of His personal associates, namely Chota Haridasa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya, along with His other confidential personal associates, but somehow or other this Chota Haridasa looked lustily on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya said, "For a sannyasi or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking toward material possessions and women for sense gratification--not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity--is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires."</p>
<p>So these are the processes for purification.</p>
<p>The next item is jnana-yoga-vyavasthitih: being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge.</p>
<p>Sannyasi life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>A sannyasi is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but this does not mean that he is a beggar.</p>
<p>Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the sannyasi goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging, but to see the householders and awaken them to Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>This is the duty of a sannyasi.</p>
<p>If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Krsna with logic and understanding, and if he is not so advanced he should not accept the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge.</p>
<p>A sannyasi or one in the renounced order of life must be situated in fearlessness, sattva-samsuddhih (purity) and jnana-yoga (knowledge).</p>
<p>The next item is charity.</p>
<p>Charity is meant for the householders.</p>
<p>The householders should earn a livelihood by an honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate Krsna consciousness all over the world.</p>
<p>Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way.</p>
<p>Charity should be given to the right receiver.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later on, charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended because it is simply a waste of money.</p>
<p>Charity should be given only to propagate Krsna consciousness all over the world.</p>
<p>That is charity in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Then as far as damah (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder.</p>
<p>Although he has a wife, a householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily.</p>
<p>There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged in for the propagation of children.</p>
<p>If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife.</p>
<p>Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children.</p>
<p>This is not in the transcendental quality but is demoniac.</p>
<p>If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving Krsna.</p>
<p>If he is able to beget children who will be in Krsna consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure.</p>
<p>Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders because sacrifices require a large amount of money.</p>
<p>Other orders of life, namely the brahmacarya, the vanaprastha and sannyasa, have no money; they live by begging.</p>
<p>So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder.</p>
<p>They should perform agni-hotra sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them.</p>
<p>The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called sankirtana-yajna, the chanting of Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>This is the best and most inexpensive sacrifice; everyone can adopt it and derive benefit.</p>
<p>So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder.</p>
<p>Then svadhyayah, Vedic study, and tapas, austerity, and arjavam, gentleness or simplicity, are meant for the brahmacarya or student life.</p>
<p>Brahmacaris should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for cultivation of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>This is called svadhyayah.</p>
<p>Tapas or austerity is especially meant for the retired life.</p>
<p>One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.</p>
<p>So after grhastha, householder life, one should retire.</p>
<p>If one lives for a hundred years, he should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five in householder life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline.</p>
<p>A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue.</p>
<p>That is tapasya.</p>
<p>The entire varnasrama-dharma society is meant for tapasya.</p>
<p>Without tapasya or austerity no human being can get liberation.</p>
<p>The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Such theories are manufactured by showbottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers.</p>
<p>If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted.</p>
<p>Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don't restrict the lives of their students nor their own lives.</p>
<p>But that method is not approved by the Vedas.</p>
<p>As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the brahmacarya-asrama, or grhastha-asrama or vanaprastha-asrama.</p>
<p>One must live very simply.</p>
<p>Ahimsa means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity.</p>
<p>One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification.</p>
<p>People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk.</p>
<p>There is no necessity for animal killing.</p>
<p>This injunction is for everyone.</p>
<p>When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice.</p>
<p>At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals.</p>
<p>Real ahimsa means not checking anyone's progressive life.</p>
<p>The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another.</p>
<p>If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked.</p>
<p>If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life.</p>
<p>So their progress should not be checked simply to satisfy one's palate.</p>
<p>This is called ahimsa.</p>
<p>Satyam.</p>
<p>This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest.</p>
<p>In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>That is the process for understanding Vedas.</p>
<p>Sruti means that one should hear from the authority.</p>
<p>One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest.</p>
<p>There are so many commentaries on Bhagavad-gita that misinterpret the original text.</p>
<p>The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Akrodhah means to check anger.</p>
<p>Even if there is provocation one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted.</p>
<p>Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger.</p>
<p>Apaisunam means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Of course to call a thief a thief is not faultfinding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>Hrih means that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable.</p>
<p>Acapalam, determination, means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt.</p>
<p>There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination.</p>
<p>The word tejah used here is meant for the ksatriyas.</p>
<p>The ksatriyas should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak.</p>
<p>They should not pose themselves as nonviolent.</p>
<p>If violence is required, they must exhibit it.</p>
<p>Saucam means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one's dealings also.</p>
<p>It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market.</p>
<p>Natimanita, not expecting honor, applies to the sudras, the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes.</p>
<p>They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the sudras to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order.</p>
<p>All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities.</p>
<p>They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order.</p>
<p>The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, the royal road to hell is described.</p>
<p>The demoniac want to make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not follow the principles.</p>
<p>They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type of education or so much wealth.</p>
<p>They desire to be worshiped by others, and demand respectability, although they do not command respect.</p>
<p>Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently.</p>
<p>They do not know what should be done and what should not be done.</p>
<p>They do everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not recognize any authority.</p>
<p>These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious qualities.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Krsna encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac qualities.</p>
<p>His involvement in the fight was not demoniac because he was considering the pro's and con's.</p>
<p>He was considering whether respectable persons such as Bhisma and Drona should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness.</p>
<p>Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons.</p>
<p>For a ksatriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac.</p>
<p>Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament.</p>
<p>Anyone who performs the regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Krsna, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way.</p>
<p>The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world.</p>
<p>Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities.</p>
<p>One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture.</p>
<p>This mentality is called divine.</p>
<p>One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric.</p>
<p>There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures.</p>
<p>It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the Prajapati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done.</p>
<p>Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the Aryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples.</p>
<p>Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons.</p>
<p>Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them.</p>
<p>Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them.</p>
<p>They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions.</p>
<p>The demons are not clean, either externally or internally.</p>
<p>One should always be careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc.</p>
<p>As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare.</p>
<p>The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness.</p>
<p>As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the Manu-samhita, which is the law of the human race.</p>
<p>Even up to today, those who are Hindu follow the Manu-samhita.</p>
<p>Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book.</p>
<p>Now, in the Manu-samhita, it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom.</p>
<p>That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children.</p>
<p>Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean that they are kept as slaves.</p>
<p>The demons have now neglected such injunctions, and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men.</p>
<p>However, this has not improved the social condition of the world.</p>
<p>Actually, a woman should be given protection at every stage of life.</p>
<p>She should be given protection by the father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grownup sons in her old age.</p>
<p>This is proper social behavior according to the Manu-samhita.</p>
<p>But modern education has artificially devised a puffed up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society.</p>
<p>Nor is the moral condition of woman very good now.</p>
<p>The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable.</p>

<p>The demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>There is no cause, no effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal.</p>
<p>They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions.</p>
<p>They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose.</p>
<p>They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it.</p>
<p>For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance.</p>
<p>According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception.</p>
<p>They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance.</p>
<p>Just as in a dream we may create so many things, which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream.</p>
<p>But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream.</p>
<p>And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland.</p>
<p>They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul.</p>
<p>For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul.</p>
<p>As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause.</p>
<p>They do not believe in the words of Krsna in Bhagavad-gita: mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram.</p>
<p>"Under My direction the whole material world is moving."</p>
<p>In other words, amongst the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of this world; every one of them has some particular theory of his own.</p>
<p>According to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another, for they do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural injunctions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction.</p>
<p>The Lord states here that they are less intelligent.</p>
<p>The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing.</p>
<p>But, according to Bhagavad-gita, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense.</p>
<p>They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings.</p>
<p>They have no idea how to behave toward one another.</p>
<p>Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people.</p>
<p>Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all.</p>
<p>Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud.</p>
<p>At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc.</p>
<p>Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here.</p>
<p>Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac mentality is described here.</p>
<p>The demons' lust is never satiated.</p>
<p>They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion.</p>
<p>They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way.</p>
<p>Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly.</p>
<p>The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things--sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth.</p>
<p>The word asuci-vratah, unclean vow, is very significant in this connection.</p>
<p>Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat eating; those are their asuci, unclean habits.</p>
<p>Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions.</p>
<p>Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them.</p>
<p>Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced.</p>

<p>Thus there is no end to their anxiety.</p>
<p>Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of life, and this concept they maintain until death.</p>
<p>They do not believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to one's karma, or activities in this world.</p>
<p>Their plans for life are never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never finished.</p>
<p>We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality, who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete.</p>
<p>Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment.</p>
<p>When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man's desire.</p>
<p>The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy.</p>
<p>The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification.</p>
<p>He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart.</p>
<p>The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul.</p>
<p>As it is stated in the Vedic literature, the Upanisads, there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing.</p>
<p>But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demoniac man knows no limit to his desire to acquire money.</p>
<p>That is unlimited.</p>
<p>He only thinks how much assessment he has just now and schemes to engage that stock of wealth farther and farther.</p>
<p>For that reason, he does not hesitate to act in any sinful way and so deals in the black market for illegal gratification.</p>
<p>He is enamoured by the possessions he has already, such as land, family, house and bank balance, and he is always planning to improve them.</p>
<p>He believes in his own strength, and he does not know that whatever he is gaining is due to his past good deeds.</p>
<p>He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes.</p>
<p>He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor.</p>
<p>A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law of karma.</p>
<p>According to the law of karma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past.</p>
<p>The demoniac thinks that all these things are accidental and due to the strength of his personal ability.</p>
<p>He does not sense any arrangement behind all the varieties of people, beauty, and education.</p>
<p>Anyone who comes into competition with such a demoniac man is his enemy.</p>
<p>There are many demoniac people, and each is enemy to the others.</p>
<p>This enmity becomes more and more deep--between persons, then between families, then between societies, and at last between nations.</p>
<p>Therefore there is constant strife, war and enmity all over the world.</p>
<p>Each demoniac person thinks that he can live at the sacrifice of all others.</p>
<p>Generally, a demoniac person thinks of himself as the Supreme God, and a demoniac preacher tells his followers: "Why are you seeking God elsewhere? You are all yourselves God! Whatever you like, you can do.</p>
<p>Don't believe in God.</p>
<p>Throw away God.</p>
<p>God is dead."</p>
<p>These are the demoniac's preachings.</p>
<p>Although the demoniac person sees others equally rich and influential, or even more so, he thinks that no one is richer than him and that no one is more influential than him.</p>
<p>As far as promotion to the higher planetary system is concerned, he does not believe in performing yajnas or sacrifices.</p>
<p>Demons think that they will manufacture their own process of yajna and prepare some machine, by which they will be able to reach any higher planet.</p>
<p>The best example of such a demoniac man was Ravana.</p>
<p>He offered a program to the people by which he would prepare a staircase so that anyone could reach the heavenly planets without performing sacrifices, such as are prescribed in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the present age such demoniac men are striving to reach the higher planetary systems by mechanical arrangement.</p>
<p>These are examples of bewilderment.</p>
<p>The result is that, without their knowledge, they are gliding toward hell.</p>
<p>Here the Sanskrit word mohajala is very significant.</p>
<p>Jala means net; like fishes caught in a net, they have no way to come out.</p>

<p>Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites.</p>

<p>This is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige.</p>
<p>Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God.</p>
<p>They make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God.</p>
<p>Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress.</p>
<p>Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world.</p>
<p>The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions.</p>
<p>They think that whatever path one can create is one's own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow.</p>
<p>The word avidhi-purvakam, meaning disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially stressed here.</p>

<p>Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse it is clearly indicated that the placing of a particular individual soul in a particular body is the prerogative of the supreme will.</p>
<p>The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power.</p>
<p>Therefore in the material existence we find so many species of life--animals, insects, men, and so on.</p>
<p>All are arranged by the superior power.</p>
<p>They are not accidental.</p>
<p>As for the demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind.</p>
<p>Such demoniac species of life are held to be always full of lust, always violent and hateful and always unclean.</p>

<p>Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me.</p>
<p>Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never merciful to the demoniac.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs.</p>
<p>It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life.</p>
<p>In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs.</p>
<p>It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons.</p>
<p>In answer to this question, in the Vedanta-sutra we find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone.</p>
<p>The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy.</p>
<p>Sometimes the asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated.</p>
<p>There are instances in history of many asuras--Ravana, Kamsa, Hiranyakasipu--to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill.</p>
<p>Therefore God's mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him.</p>

<p>The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kunti, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should be very careful of these three enemies to human life: lust, anger, and greed.</p>
<p>The more a person is freed from lust, anger and greed, the more his existence becomes pure.</p>

<p>By following the regulative principles of human life, one gradually raises himself to the platform of spiritual realization.</p>
<p>If one is so fortunate, by such practice, to rise to the platform of Krsna consciousness, then success is guaranteed for him.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literature, the ways of action and reaction are prescribed to enable one to come to the stage of purification.</p>
<p>The whole method is based on giving up lust, greed and anger.</p>
<p>By cultivating knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service.</p>
<p>In that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life, called the caste system and the spiritual order system.</p>
<p>There are different rules and regulations for different castes or divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization.</p>
<p>Then he can have liberation without a doubt.</p>

<p>Everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations.</p>
<p>If one does not follow them and acts whimsically according to his lust, greed and desire, then he never will be perfect in his life.</p>
<p>In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind.</p>

<p>Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not in Krsna consciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas.</p>
<p>One should act accordingly, without argument.</p>
<p>That is called following the principles of sastra, or scripture.</p>
<p>Sastra is without the four principal defects that are visible in the conditioned soul: imperfect senses, the propensity for cheating, certainty of committing mistakes, and certainty of being illusioned.</p>
<p>These four principal defects in conditioned life disqualify one from putting forth rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the rules and regulations as described in the sastra--being above these defects--are accepted without alteration by all great saints, acaryas, and great souls.</p>
<p>In India there are many parties of spiritual understanding, generally classified as two: the impersonalist and the personalist.</p>
<p>Both of them, however, lead their lives according to the principles of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Without following the principles of the scriptures, one cannot elevate himself to the perfectional stage.</p>
<p>One who actually, therefore, understands the purport of the sastras is considered fortunate.</p>
<p>In human society, aversion to the principles of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all falldowns.</p>
<p>That is the greatest offense of human life.</p>
<p>Therefore, maya, the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always giving us trouble in the shape of the threefold miseries.</p>
<p>This material energy is constituted of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>One has to raise himself at least to the mode of goodness before the path to understanding the Supreme Lord can be opened.</p>
<p>Without raising oneself to the standard of the mode of goodness, one remains in ignorance and passion, which are the cause of demoniac life.</p>
<p>Those in the modes of passion and ignorance deride the scriptures, deride the holy man, and deride the proper understanding of the spiritual master, and they do not care for the regulations of the scriptures.</p>
<p>In spite of hearing the glories of devotional service, they are not attracted.</p>
<p>Thus they manufacture their own way of elevation.</p>
<p>These are some of the defects of human society, which lead to the demoniac status of life.</p>
<p>If, however, one is able to be guided by a proper and bona fide spiritual master, who can lead one to the path of elevation, to the higher stage, then one's life becomes successful.</p>

<p>Arjuna said, O Krsna, what is the situation of one who does not follow the principles of scripture but worships according to his own imagination? Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Fourth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse, it is said that a person faithful to a particular type of worship gradually becomes elevated to the stage of knowledge and attains the highest perfectional stage of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>In the Sixteenth Chapter, it is concluded that one who does not follow the principles laid down in the scriptures is called an asura, demon, and one who follows the scriptural injunctions faithfully is called a deva, or demigod.</p>
<p>Now, if one, with faith, follows some rules which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions, what is his position? This doubt of Arjuna is to be cleared by Krsna.</p>
<p>Are those who create some sort of God by selecting a human being and placing their faith in him worshiping in goodness, passion or ignorance? Do such persons attain the perfectional stage of life? Is it possible for them to be situated in real knowledge and elevate themselves to the highest perfectional stage? Do those who do not follow the rules and regulations of the scriptures but who have faith in something and worship gods and demigods and men attain success in their effort? Arjuna is putting these questions to Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord said, according to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one's faith can be of three kinds--goodness, passion or ignorance.</p>
<p>Now hear about these.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those who know the rules and regulations of the scriptures, but, out of laziness or indolence, give up following these rules and regulations, are governed by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>According to their previous activities in the modes of goodness, passion or ignorance, they acquire a nature which is of a specific quality.</p>
<p>The association of the living entity with the different modes of nature has been going on perpetually since the living entity is in contact with material nature.</p>
<p>Thus he acquires different types of mentality according to his association with the material modes.</p>
<p>But this nature can be changed if one associates with a bona fide spiritual master and abides by his rules and the scriptures.</p>
<p>Gradually, one can change his position from ignorance to goodness, or from passion to goodness.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that blind faith in a particular mode of nature cannot help a person become elevated to the perfectional stage.</p>
<p>One has to consider things carefully, with intelligence, in the association of a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Thus one can change his position to a higher mode of nature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>According to one's existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of faith.</p>
<p>The living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the modes he has acquired.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has a particular type of faith, regardless of what he is.</p>
<p>But his faith is considered good, passionate or ignorant according to the nature he has acquired.</p>
<p>Thus, according to his particular type of faith, one associates with certain persons.</p>
<p>Now the real fact is that every living being, as is stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, is originally the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore one is originally transcendental to all the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>But when one forgets his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and comes into contact with the material nature in conditional life, he generates his own position by association with the different varieties of material nature.</p>
<p>The resultant artificial faith and existence are only material.</p>
<p>Although one may be conducted by some impression, or some conception of life, still, originally, he is nirguna, or transcendental.</p>
<p>Therefore one has to become cleansed of the material contamination that he has acquired in order to regain his relationship with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>That is the only path back without fear: Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If one is situated in Krsna consciousness, then that path is guaranteed for his elevation to the perfectional stage.</p>
<p>If one does not take to this path of self-realization, then he is surely to be conducted by the influence of the modes of nature.</p>
<p>The word sattva, or faith, is very significant in this verse.</p>
<p>Sattva or faith always comes out of the works of goodness.</p>
<p>One's faith may be in a demigod or some created God or some mental concoction.</p>
<p>It is supposed to be one's strong faith in something that is productive of the works of material goodness.</p>
<p>But in material conditional life, no works of material nature are completely purified.</p>
<p>They are mixed.</p>
<p>They are not in pure goodness.</p>
<p>Pure goodness is transcendental; in purified goodness one can understand the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As long as one's faith is not completely in purified goodness, the faith is subject to contamination by any of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The contaminated modes of material nature expand to the heart.</p>
<p>Therefore according to the position of the heart in contact with a particular mode of material nature, one's faith is established.</p>
<p>It should be understood, that if one's heart is in the mode of goodness, his faith is also in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>If his heart is in the mode of passion, his faith is also in the mode of passion.</p>
<p>And if his heart is in the mode of darkness, illusion, his faith is also thus contaminated.</p>
<p>Thus we find different types of faith in this world, and there are different types of religions due to different types of faith.</p>
<p>The real principle of religious faith is situated in the mode of pure goodness, but because the heart is tainted, we find different types of religious principles.</p>
<p>Thus according to different types of faith, there are different kinds of worship.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Men in the mode of goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons; and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the Supreme Personality of Godhead describes different kinds of worshipers according to their external activities.</p>
<p>According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods include Brahma, Siva and others such as Indra, Candra and the sun-god.</p>
<p>There are various demigods.</p>
<p>Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons.</p>
<p>We recall that during the Second World War, a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market.</p>
<p>Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God.</p>
<p>They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained.</p>
<p>Now, it is clearly described here that those who are in the mode of passion worship and create such gods, and those who are in the mode of ignorance, in darkness, worship dead spirits.</p>
<p>Sometimes people worship at the tomb of some dead man.</p>
<p>Sexual service is also considered to be in the mode of darkness.</p>
<p>Similarly, in remote villages in India there are worshipers of ghosts.</p>
<p>We have seen that in India the lower class people sometimes go to the forest, and if they have knowledge that a ghost lives in a tree, they worship that tree and offer sacrifices.</p>
<p>These different kinds of worship are not actually God worship.</p>
<p>God worship is for persons who are transcendentally situated in pure goodness.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said, sattvam visuddham vasudeva-sabditam.</p>
<p>"When a man is situated in pure goodness, he worships Vasudeva."</p>
<p>The purport is that those who are completely purified of the material modes of nature and who are transcendentally situated can worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The impersonalists are supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness, and they worship five kinds of demigods.</p>
<p>They worship the impersonal Visnu, or Visnu form in the material world, which is known as philosophized Visnu.</p>
<p>Visnu is the expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the impersonalists, because they do not ultimately believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, imagine that the Visnu form is just another aspect of the impersonal Brahman; similarly, they imagine that Lord Brahma is the impersonal form in the material mode of passion.</p>
<p>Thus they sometimes describe five kinds of gods that are worshipable, but because they think that the actual truth is impersonal Brahman, they dispose of all worshipable objects at the ultimate end.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the different qualities of the material modes of nature can be purified through association with persons who are of transcendental nature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those who undergo severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing them out of pride, egotism, lust and attachment, who are impelled by passion and who torture their bodily organs as well as the Supersoul dwelling within are to be known as demons.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penances which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions.</p>
<p>For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions.</p>
<p>The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose.</p>
<p>Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gita, certainly demoniac.</p>
<p>Their acts are against the scriptural injunction and are not beneficial for the people in general.</p>
<p>Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>By such activities, not only are the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body.</p>
<p>Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others.</p>
<p>They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting.</p>
<p>These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons.</p>
<p>Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions.</p>
<p>The word acetasah is significant in this connection--persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions.</p>
<p>Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances.</p>
<p>One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>The Lord forces them to take birth in the womb of demoniac persons.</p>
<p>Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal.</p>

<p>Foods in the mode of goodness increase the duration of life, purify one's existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Such nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable.</p>
<p>Foods that are too bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, dry and hot, are liked by people in the modes of passion.</p>
<p>Such foods cause pain, distress, and disease.</p>
<p>Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Thc purpose of food is to increase the duration of life, purify the mind and aid bodily strength.</p>
<p>This is its only purpose.</p>
<p>In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life's duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods.</p>
<p>They are then in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>All these foods are pure by nature.</p>
<p>They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor.</p>
<p>Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter.</p>
<p>Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods.</p>
<p>Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures.</p>
<p>It is only through brute mentality that this killing goes on.</p>
<p>The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk.</p>
<p>Slaughter is the way of subhumans.</p>
<p>Protein is amply available through split peas, dhall, whole wheat, etc.</p>
<p>Foods in the mode of passion, which are bitter, too salty, or too hot or overly mixed with red pepper, cause misery by producing mucous in the stomach, leading to disease.</p>
<p>Foods in the mode of ignorance or darkness are essentially those that are not fresh.</p>
<p>Any food cooked more than three hours before it is eaten (except prasadam, food offered to the Lord) is considered to be in the mode of darkness.</p>
<p>Because they are decomposing, such foods give a bad odor, which often attracts people in this mode but repulses those in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Remnants of food may be eaten only when they are part of a meal that was first offered to the Supreme Lord or first eaten by saintly persons, especially the spiritual master.</p>
<p>Otherwise the remnants of food are considered to be in the mode of darkness, and they increase infection or disease.</p>
<p>Such foodstuffs, although very palatable to persons in the mode of darkness, are neither liked nor even touched by those in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>The best food is the remnant of what is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Supreme Lord says that He accepts preparations of vegetables, flour and milk when offered with devotion.</p>
<p>Patram puspam phalam toyam.</p>
<p>Of course, devotion and love are the chief things which the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts.</p>
<p>But it is also mentioned that the prasadam should be prepared in a particular way.</p>
<p>Any food prepared by the injunction of the scripture offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be taken even if prepared long, long ago, because such food is transcendental.</p>
<p>Therefore to make food antiseptic, eatable and palatable for all persons, one should offer food to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>He should not indulge in sex outside of married life, for sex is sanctioned in the scripture only in marriage, not otherwise.</p>
<p>This is called celibacy.</p>
<p>These are penances and austerities as far as the body is concerned.</p>

<p>Austerity of speech consists in speaking truthfully and beneficially and in avoiding speech that offends.</p>
<p>One should also recite the Vedas regularly.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should not speak in such a way as to agitate the minds of others.</p>
<p>Of course, when a teacher speaks, he can speak the truth for the instruction of his students, but such a teacher should not speak to others who are not his students if he will agitate their minds.</p>
<p>This is penance as far as talking is concerned.</p>
<p>Besides that, one should not talk nonsense.</p>
<p>When speaking in spiritual circles, one's statements must be upheld by the scriptures.</p>
<p>One should at once quote from scriptural authority to back up what he is saying.</p>
<p>At the same time, such talk should be very pleasurable to the ear.</p>
<p>By such discussions, one may derive the highest benefit and elevate human society.</p>
<p>There is a limitless stock of Vedic literature, and one should study this.</p>
<p>This is called penance of speech.</p>

<p>And serenity, simplicity, gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the austerities of the mind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification.</p>
<p>It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others.</p>
<p>The best training for the mind is gravity in thought.</p>
<p>One should not deviate from Krsna consciousness and must always avoid sense gratification.</p>
<p>To purify one's nature is to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied.</p>
<p>In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind's becoming satisfied.</p>
<p>The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Puranas and the Mahabharata.</p>
<p>One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified.</p>
<p>The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all.</p>
<p>Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization.</p>
<p>The person in Krsna consciousness observes perfect silence in this sense.</p>
<p>Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>One should be straightforward in his dealing and thereby purify his existence.</p>
<p>All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities.</p>

<p>In the Vedic literature, charity given to a person engaged in spiritual activities is recommended.</p>
<p>There is no recommendation for giving charity indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Spiritual perfection is always a consideration.</p>
<p>Therefore charity is recommended to be given at a place of pilgrimage and at lunar or solar eclipses or at the end of the month or to a qualified brahmana or a Vaisnava (devotee) or in temples.</p>
<p>Such charities should be given without any consideration of return.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From the beginning of creation, the three syllables--om tat sat--have been used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman].</p>
<p>They were uttered by brahmanas while chanting Vedic hymns and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the Supreme.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It has been explained that penance, sacrifice, charity and foods are divided into three categories: the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>But whether first class, second class or third class, they are all conditioned, contaminated by the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>When they are aimed at the Supreme--om tat sat, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal--they become means for spiritual elevation.</p>
<p>In the scriptural injunctions such an objective is indicated.</p>
<p>These three words, om tat sat, particularly indicate the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In the Vedic hymns, the word om is always found.</p>
<p>One who acts without following the regulations of the scriptures will not attain the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>He will get some temporary result, but not the ultimate end of life.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that the performance of charities, sacrifice and penance must be done in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Performed in the modes of passion or ignorance, they are certainly inferior in quality.</p>
<p>The three words om tat sat are uttered in conjunction with the holy name of the Supreme Lord, e.g., om tad visnoh.</p>
<p>Whenever a Vedic hymn or the holy name of the Supreme Lord is uttered, om is added.</p>
<p>This is the indication of Vedic literature.</p>
<p>These three words are taken from Vedic hymns.</p>
<p>Om ity etad brahmano nedistam nama indicates the first goal.</p>
<p>Then tattvamasi indicates the second goal.</p>
<p>And sad eva saumya indicates the third goal.</p>
<p>Combined they become om tat sat.</p>
<p>Formerly when Brahma, the first created living entity, performed sacrifices, he spoke these three names of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The same principle holds by disciplic succession.</p>
<p>So this hymn has great significance.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita recommends, therefore, that any work done should be done for om tat sat, or for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When one performs penance, charity, and sacrifice with these three words, he is acting in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is a scientific execution of transcendental activities which enables one to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>There is no loss of energy in acting in such a transcendental way.</p>

<p>The Absolute Truth is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is indicated by the word sat.</p>
<p>These works of sacrifice, of penance and of charity, true to the absolute nature, are performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of Prtha.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The words prasaste karmani, or prescribed duties, indicate that there are many activities prescribed in the Vedic literature which are purificatory processes beginning from parental care up to the end of one's life.</p>
<p>Such purificatory processes are adopted for the ultimate liberation of the living entity.</p>
<p>In all such activities it is recommended that one should vibrate om tat sat.</p>
<p>The words sad-bhave and sadhu-bhave indicate the transcendental situation.</p>
<p>One who is acting in Krsna consciousness is called sattva, and one who is fully conscious of activities in Krsna consciousness is called svarupa.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said that the transcendental subject matter becomes clear in the association of the devotees.</p>
<p>Without good association, one cannot achieve transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>When initiating a person or offering the sacred thread, one vibrates the words om tat sat.</p>
<p>Similarly, in all kinds of yogic performances, the supreme object, om tat sat is invoked.</p>
<p>These words om tat sat are used to perfect all activities.</p>
<p>This supreme om tat sat makes everything complete.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Anything done without the transcendental objective--whether it be sacrifice, charity or penance-is useless.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this verse, it is declared that such activities are abominable.</p>
<p>Everything should be done for the Supreme in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Without such faith, and without the proper guidance, there can never be any fruit.</p>
<p>In all the Vedic scriptures, faith in the Supreme is advised.</p>
<p>In the pursuit of all Vedic instructions, the ultimate goal is the understanding of Krsna.</p>
<p>No one can obtain success without following this principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best course is to work from the very beginning in Krsna consciousness under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>That is the way to make everything successful.</p>
<p>In the conditional state, people are attracted to worship demigods, ghosts, or Yaksas like Kuvera.</p>
<p>The mode of goodness is better than the modes of passion and ignorance, but one who takes directly to Krsna consciousness is transcendental to all three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Although there is a process of gradual elevation, if one, by the association of pure devotees, takes directly to Krsna consciousness, that is the best way.</p>
<p>And that is recommended in this chapter.</p>
<p>To achieve success in this way, one must first find the proper spiritual master and receive training under his direction.</p>
<p>Then one can achieve faith in the Supreme.</p>
<p>When that faith matures, in course of time, it is called love of God.</p>
<p>This love is the ultimate goal of the living entities.</p>
<p>One should, therefore, take to Krsna consciousness directly.</p>
<p>That is the message of this Seventeenth Chapter.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Actually the Bhagavad-gita is finished in seventeen chapters.</p>
<p>The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before.</p>
<p>In every chapter of Bhagavad-gita, Lord Krsna stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life.</p>
<p>This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge.</p>
<p>In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yoginam api sarvesam... "Of all yogis or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best."</p>
<p>In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed.</p>
<p>In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described.</p>
<p>It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, summarized by the words om tat sat, which indicate Visnu, the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>In the third part of Bhagavad-gita, devotional service was established by the example of past acaryas and the Brahma-sutra, the Vedanta-sutra, which cites that devotional service is the ultimate purpose of life and nothing else.</p>
<p>Certain impersonalists consider themselves monopolizers of the knowledge of Vedanta-sutra, but actually the Vedanta-sutra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vedanta-sutra, and He is its knower.</p>
<p>That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter.</p>
<p>In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective.</p>
<p>That is explained in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, similarly, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given.</p>
<p>The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature.</p>
<p>Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-gita, namely renunciation (tyaga) and the renounced order of life (sannyasa).</p>
<p>Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.</p>
<p>Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord--Hrsikesa and Kesinisudana--are significant.</p>
<p>Hrsikesa is Krsna, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity.</p>
<p>Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equiposed.</p>
<p>Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons.</p>
<p>He therefore addresses Krsna as Kesinisudana.</p>
<p>Kesi was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting Krsna to kill the demon of doubt.</p>

<p>The performance of activities for results has to be given up.</p>
<p>This is the instruction of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>But activities leading to advanced spiritual knowledge are not to be given up.</p>
<p>This will be made clear in the next verse.</p>
<p>There are many prescriptions of methods for performing sacrifice for some particular purpose in the Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>There are certain sacrifices to perform to attain a good son or to attain elevation to the higher planets, but sacrifices prompted by desires should be stopped.</p>
<p>However, sacrifice for the purification of one's heart or for advancement in the spiritual science should not be given up.</p>

<p>Some learned men declare that all kinds of fruitive activities should be given up, but there are yet other sages who maintain that acts of sacrifice, charity and penance should never be abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are many activities in the Vedic literatures which are subjects of contention.</p>
<p>For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain animal killing is completely abominable.</p>
<p>Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed.</p>
<p>The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal.</p>
<p>Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life.</p>
<p>But there are different opinions among the sages.</p>
<p>Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good.</p>
<p>All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself.</p>

<p>Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up but should be performed.</p>
<p>Indeed, sacrifice, charity and penance purify even the great souls.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The yogis should perform acts for the advancement of human society.</p>
<p>There are many purificatory processes for advancing a human being to spiritual life.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices.</p>
<p>It is called vivaha-yajna.</p>
<p>Should a sannyasi, who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up.</p>
<p>Vivaha-yajna, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind to become peaceful for spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>For most men, this vivaha-yajna should be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>Sannyasis should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up.</p>
<p>Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart.</p>
<p>If charity is given to suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual life.</p>

<p>Although all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such performances.</p>
<p>In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one's existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped.</p>
<p>Everything that leads to Krsna consciousness must be encouraged.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted.</p>

<p>O mighty-armed Arjuna, learn from Me of the five factors which bring about the accomplishment of all action.</p>
<p>These are declared in sankhya philosophy to be the place of action, the performer, the senses, the endeavor, and ultimately the Supersoul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A question may be raised that since any activity performed must have some reaction, how is it that the person in Krsna consciousness does not suffer or enjoy the reactions of work? The Lord is citing Vedanta philosophy to show how this is possible.</p>
<p>He says that there are five causes for all activities and for success in all activity, and one should know these five causes.</p>
<p>Sankhya means the stalk of knowledge, and Vedanta is the final stalk of knowledge accepted by all leading acaryas.</p>
<p>Even Sankara accepts Vedanta-sutra as such.</p>
<p>Therefore such authority should be consulted.</p>
<p>The ultimate will is invested in the Supersoul, as it is stated in the Gita, "sarvasya caham hrdi."</p>
<p>He is engaging everyone in certain activities.</p>
<p>Acts done under His direction from within yield no reaction, either in this life or in the life after death.</p>
<p>The instruments of action are the senses, and by senses the soul acts in various ways, and for each and every action there is a different endeavor.</p>
<p>But all one's activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart as a friend.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the super cause.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, he who is acting in Krsna consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity.</p>
<p>Those in complete Krsna consciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions.</p>
<p>Everything is dependant on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The words "right" and "wrong" are very significant in this verse.</p>
<p>Right work is work done in terms of the prescribed directions in the scriptures, and wrong work is work done against the principles of the scriptural injunctions.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the Lord informs Arjuna that the desire not to fight arises from false ego.</p>
<p>Arjuna thought himself to be the doer of action, but he did not consider the Supreme sanction within and without.</p>
<p>If one does not know that a super sanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instrument of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner, is perfect in doing everything.</p>
<p>Such a person is never in illusion.</p>
<p>Personal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Anyone who is acting in Krsna consciousness under the direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though killing, does not kill.</p>
<p>Nor is he ever affected with the reaction of such killing.</p>
<p>When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not subject to be judged.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of impetus for daily work: knowledge, the object of knowledge and the knower.</p>
<p>The instruments of work, the work itself and the worker are called the constituents of work.</p>
<p>Any work done by any human being has these elements.</p>
<p>Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called inspiration.</p>
<p>Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form of work.</p>

<p>A person who sees one spirit soul in every living being, whether a demigod, human being, animal, bird, beast, aquatic or plant, possesses knowledge in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>In all living entities, one spirit soul is there, although they have different bodies in terms of their previous work.</p>
<p>As described in the Seventh Chapter, the manifestation of the living force in every body is due to the superior nature of the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all, without knowledge of the truth, and which is very meager, is said to be in the mode of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The "knowledge" of the common man is always in the mode of darkness or ignorance because every living entity in conditional life is born into the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>One who does not develop knowledge through the authorities or scriptural injunctions has knowledge that is limited to the body.</p>
<p>He is not concerned about acting in terms of the directions of scripture.</p>
<p>For him God is money, and knowledge means the satisfaction of bodily demands.</p>

<p>And the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading.</p>
<p>Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies.</p>
<p>Generally the Vaisnava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy.</p>
<p>His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy.</p>
<p>The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion as Paramatma is situated everywhere.</p>
<p>He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere.</p>
<p>One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render service unto the Supreme.</p>
<p>Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That is recommended in this verse.</p>
<p>Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by Hrsikesa, the master of the senses.</p>
<p>And, by the result of the work in which one is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, should be worshiped.</p>
<p>If one thinks always in this way, in full Krsna consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything.</p>
<p>That is the perfection of life.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, tesam aham samuddharta.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee.</p>
<p>That is the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord, he will achieve the highest perfection.</p>

<p>sreyan--better; sva-dharmah--one's own occupation; vigunah--imperfectly performed; para-dharmat--another's occupation; svanusthitat--perfectly done; svabhava-niyatam--prescribed duties according to one's nature; karma--work; kurvan--performing; na--never; apnoti--achieve; kilbisam--sinful reactions.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>It is better to engage in one's own occupation, even though one may perform it imperfectly, than to accept another's occupation and perform it perfectly.</p>
<p>Prescribed duties, according to one's nature, are never affected by sinful reactions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One's occupational duty is prescribed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>As already discussed in previous verses, the duties of a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra are prescribed according to the particular modes of nature.</p>
<p>One should not imitate another's duty.</p>
<p>A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by sudras should not artificially claim himself to be a brahmana, although he may be born into a brahmana family.</p>
<p>In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The occupational duty of a brahmana is certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of a brahmana.</p>
<p>For a ksatriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; a ksatriya has to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes a ksatriya has to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy.</p>
<p>Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but a ksatriya is not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of a brahmana.</p>
<p>One should act to satisfy the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>For example, Arjuna was a ksatriya.</p>
<p>He was hesitating to fight the other party.</p>
<p>But if such fighting is performed for the sake of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there need be no fear of degradation.</p>
<p>In the business field also, sometimes a merchant has to tell so many lies to make a profit.</p>
<p>If he does not do so, there can be no profit.</p>
<p>Sometimes a merchant says, "Oh, my dear customer, for you I am making no profit," but one should know that without profit the merchant cannot exist.</p>
<p>Therefore it should be taken as a simple lie if a merchant says that he is not making a profit.</p>
<p>But the merchant should not think that because he is engaged in an occupation in which the telling of lies is compulsory, he should give up his profession and pursue the profession of a brahmana.</p>
<p>That is not recommended.</p>
<p>Whether one is a ksatriya, a vaisya, or a sudra doesn't matter, if he serves, by his work, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Even brahmanas, who perform different types of sacrifice, sometimes must kill animals because sometimes animals are sacrificed in such ceremonies.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a ksatriya engaged in his own occupation kills an enemy, there is no sin incurred.</p>
<p>In the Third Chapter these matters have been clearly and elaborately explained; every man should work for the purpose of yajna, or for Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Anything done for personal sense gratification is a cause of bondage.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that everyone should be engaged according to the particular mode of nature he has acquired, and he should decide to work only to serve the supreme cause of the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Every endeavor is covered by some sort of fault, just as fire is covered by smoke.</p>
<p>Therefore one should not give up the work which is born of his nature, O son of Kunti, even if such work is full of fault.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In conditioned life, all work is contaminated by the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>Even if one is a brahmana, he has to perform sacrifices in which animal killing is necessary.</p>
<p>Similarly, a ksatriya, however pious he may be, has to fight enemies.</p>
<p>He cannot avoid it.</p>
<p>Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market.</p>
<p>These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them.</p>
<p>Similarly, even though a man is a sudra serving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done.</p>
<p>Despite these flaws, one should continue to carry out his prescribed duties, for they are born out of his own nature.</p>
<p>A very nice example is given herein.</p>
<p>Although fire is pure, still there is smoke.</p>
<p>Yet smoke does not make the fire impure.</p>
<p>Even though there is smoke in the fire, fire is still considered to be the purest of all elements.</p>
<p>If one prefers to give up the work of a ksatriya and take up the occupation of a brahmana, he is not assured that in the occupation of a brahmana there are no unpleasant duties.</p>
<p>One may then conclude that in the material world no one can be completely free from the contamination of material nature.</p>
<p>This example of fire and smoke is very appropriate in this connection.</p>
<p>When in winter time one takes a stone from the fire, sometimes smoke disturbs the eyes and other parts of the body, but still one must make use of the fire despite disturbing conditions.</p>
<p>Similarly, one should not give up his natural occupation because there are some disturbing elements.</p>
<p>Rather, one should be determined to serve the Supreme Lord by his occupational duty in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>That is the perfectional point.</p>
<p>When a particular type of occupation is performed for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, all the defects in that particular occupation are purified.</p>
<p>When the results of work are purified, when connected with devotional service, one becomes perfect in seeing the self within, and that is self-realization.</p>

<p>One can obtain the results of renunciation simply by self-control and by becoming unattached to material things and disregarding material enjoyments.</p>
<p>That is the highest perfectional stage of renunciation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Real renunciation means that one should always think himself part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore he has no right to enjoy the results of his work.</p>
<p>Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This is actually Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The person acting in Krsna consciousness is really a sannyasi, one in the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>By such mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme.</p>
<p>Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>A sannyasi is supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is in Krsna consciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation.</p>
<p>This state of mind is called yogarudha, or the perfectional stage of yoga, as confirmed in the Third Chapter: yas tv atma-ratir eva syat.</p>
<p>One who is satisfied in himself has no fear of any kind of reaction from his activity.</p>

<p>Being purified by his intelligence and controlling the mind with determination, giving up the objects of sense gratification, being freed from attachment and hatred, one who lives in a secluded place, who eats little and who controls the body and the tongue, and is always in trance and is detached, who is without false ego, false strength, false pride, lust, anger, and who does not accept material things, such a person is certainly elevated to the position of self-realization.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When one is purified by knowledge, he keeps himself in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in trance.</p>
<p>Because he is not attached to the objects of sense gratification, he does not eat more than what he requires, and he controls the activities of his body and mind.</p>
<p>He has no false ego because he does not accept the body as himself.</p>
<p>Nor has he a desire to make the body fat and strong by accepting so many material things.</p>
<p>Because he has no bodily concept of life, he is not falsely proud.</p>
<p>He is satisfied with everything that is offered to him by the grace of the Lord, and he is never angry in the absence of sense gratification.</p>
<p>Nor does he endeavor to acquire sense objects.</p>
<p>Thus when he is completely free from false ego, he becomes nonattached to all material things, and that is the stage of self-realization of Brahman.</p>
<p>That stage is called the brahma-bhuta stage.</p>
<p>When one is free from the material conception of life, he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated.</p>

<p>One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity.</p>
<p>In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To the impersonalist, achieving the brahma-bhuta stage, becoming one with the Absolute, is the last word.</p>
<p>But for the personalist, or pure devotee, one has to go still further to become engaged in pure devotional service.</p>
<p>This means that one who is engaged in pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord is already in a state of liberation, called brahma-bhuta, oneness with the Absolute.</p>
<p>Without being one with the Supreme, the Absolute, one cannot render service unto Him.</p>
<p>In the absolute conception, there is no difference between the served and the servitor; yet the distinction is there, in a higher spiritual sense.</p>
<p>In the material concept of life, when one works for sense gratification, there is misery, but in the absolute world, when one is engaged in pure devotional service, there is no misery.</p>
<p>The devotee in Krsna consciousness has nothing to lament or desire.</p>
<p>Since God is full, a living entity who is engaged in God's service, in Krsna consciousness, becomes also full in himself.</p>
<p>He is just like a river cleansed of all dirty water.</p>
<p>Because a pure devotee has no thought other than Krsna, he is naturally always joyful.</p>
<p>He does not lament for any material loss or gain because he is full in service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He has no desire for material enjoyment because he knows that every living entity is the fragmental part and parcel of the Supreme Lord and therefore eternally a servant.</p>
<p>He does not see, in the material world, someone as higher and someone as lower; higher and lower positions are ephemeral, and a devotee has nothing to do with ephemeral appearances or disappearances.</p>
<p>For him stone and gold are of equal value.</p>
<p>This is the brahma-bhuta stage, and this stage is attained very easily by the pure devotee.</p>
<p>In that stage of existence, the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Brahman and annihilating one's individuality becomes hellish, and the idea of attaining the heavenly kingdom becomes phantasmagoria, and the senses are like broken serpents' teeth.</p>
<p>As there is no fear of a serpent with broken teeth, so there is no fear from the senses when they are automatically controlled.</p>
<p>The world is miserable for the materially infected person, but for a devotee the entire world is as good as Vaikuntha, or the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>The highest personality in this material universe is no more significant than an ant for a devotee.</p>
<p>Such a stage can be achieved by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, who preached pure devotional service in this age.</p>

<p>One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service.</p>
<p>And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and His plenary portions cannot be understood by mental speculation nor by the nondevotees.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has to take to pure devotional service under the guidance of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead will always be hidden.</p>
<p>It is already stated (naham prakasah) that He is not revealed to everyone.</p>
<p>Everyone cannot understand God simply by erudite scholarship or mental speculation.</p>
<p>Only one who is actually engaged in Krsna consciousness and devotional service can understand what Krsna is.</p>
<p>University degrees are not helpful.</p>
<p>One who is fully conversant with the Krsna science becomes eligible to enter into the spiritual kingdom, the abode of Krsna.</p>
<p>Becoming Brahman does not mean that one loses his identity.</p>
<p>Devotional service is there, and as long as devotional service exists, there must be God, the devotee, and the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>Such knowledge is never vanquished, even after liberation.</p>
<p>Liberation involves getting free from the concept of material life; in spiritual life the same distinction is there, the same individuality is there, but in pure Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One should not misunderstand that the word visate, "enters into Me," supports the monist theory that one becomes homogeneous with the impersonal Brahman.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Visate means that one can enter into the abode of the Supreme Lord in his individuality to engage in His association and render service unto Him.</p>
<p>For instance, a green bird enters a green tree not to become one with the tree but to enjoy the fruits of the tree.</p>
<p>Impersonalists generally give the example of a river flowing into the ocean and merging.</p>
<p>This may be a source of happiness for the impersonalist, but the personalist keeps his personal individuality like an aquatic in the ocean.</p>
<p>We find so many living entities within the ocean, if we go deep.</p>
<p>Surface acquaintance with the ocean is not sufficient; one must have complete knowledge of the aquatics living in the ocean depths.</p>
<p>Because of his pure devotional service, a devotee can understand the transcendental qualities and the opulences of the Supreme Lord in truth.</p>
<p>As it is stated in the Eleventh Chapter, only by devotional service can one understand.</p>
<p>The same is confirmed here; one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by devotional service and enter into His kingdom.</p>
<p>After attainment of the brahma-bhuta stage of freedom from material conceptions, devotional service begins by one's hearing about the Lord.</p>
<p>When one hears about the Supreme Lord, automatically the brahma-bhuta stage develops, and material contamination--greediness and lust for sense enjoyment--disappears.</p>
<p>As lust and desires disappear from the heart of a devotee, he becomes more attached to the service of the Lord, and by such attachment he becomes free from material contamination.</p>
<p>In that state of life he can understand the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This is the statement of Srimad-Bhagavatam also.</p>
<p>Also after liberation the process of bhakti or transcendental service continues.</p>
<p>The Vedanta-sutra confirms this: aprayanat tatrapi hi drstam.</p>
<p>This means that after liberation the process of devotional service continues.</p>
<p>In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, real devotional liberation is defined as the reinstatement of the living entity in his own identity, his own constitutional position.</p>
<p>The constitutional position is already explained: every living entity is the part and parcel fragmental portion of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore his constitutional position is to serve.</p>
<p>After liberation, this service is never stopped.</p>
<p>Actual liberation is getting free from misconceptions of life.</p>

<p>In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection.</p>
<p>In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When one acts in Krsna consciousness, he does not act as the master of the world.</p>
<p>Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>A servant has no individual independence.</p>
<p>He acts only on the order of the master.</p>
<p>A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master has no affection for profit and loss.</p>
<p>He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord.</p>
<p>Now, one may argue that Arjuna was acting under the personal direction of Krsna, but, when Krsna is not present, how should one act? If one acts according to the direction of Krsna in this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative of Krsna, then the result will be the same.</p>
<p>The Sanskrit word mat-parah is very important in this verse.</p>
<p>It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting in Krsna consciousness just to satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>And, while working in that way, one should think of Krsna only: "I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty by Krsna."</p>
<p>While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think of Krsna.</p>
<p>This is perfect Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One should, however, note that, after doing something whimsically, he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>That sort of duty is not in the devotional service of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One should act according to the order of Krsna.</p>
<p>This is a very important point.</p>
<p>That order of Krsna comes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Therefore the spiritual master's order should be taken as the prime duty of life.</p>
<p>If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then his perfection of life in Krsna consciousness is guaranteed.</p>

<p>A person in full Krsna consciousness is not unduly anxious to execute the duties of his existence.</p>
<p>The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety.</p>
<p>For one who acts in Krsna consciousness, Lord Krsna becomes the most intimate friend.</p>
<p>He always looks after His friend's comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a day to please the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life.</p>
<p>One should not falsely think himself independant of the laws of material nature or free to act.</p>
<p>He is already under strict material laws.</p>
<p>But, as soon as he acts in Krsna consciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities.</p>
<p>One should note very carefully that one who is not active in Krsna consciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death.</p>
<p>No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who acts in Krsna consciousness is free to act because everything is prompted by Krsna from within and confirmed by the spiritual master.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna was a military man, and born of the nature of the ksatriya.</p>
<p>Therefore his natural duty was to fight.</p>
<p>But, due to false ego, he was fearing that by killing his teacher, grandfather and friends, there would be sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Actually he was considering himself master of his actions, as if he were directing the good and bad results of such work.</p>
<p>He forgot that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present there, instructing him to fight.</p>
<p>That is the forgetfulness of the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act in Krsna consciousness to attain the perfection of life.</p>
<p>No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act.</p>
<p>No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master who is the representative of God.</p>
<p>One should act unhesitatingly to execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead--that will keep him safe under all circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arjuna was not the supreme knower, and his decision to fight or not to fight was confined to his limited discretion.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna instructed that the individual is not all in all.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, or He Himself, Krsna, the localized Supersoul, sits in the heart directing the living being.</p>
<p>After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities.</p>
<p>Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul.</p>
<p>The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul.</p>
<p>As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation.</p>
<p>A person seated in a high-speed motor car goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same.</p>
<p>Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity to work according to his past desires.</p>
<p>The living entity is not independant.</p>
<p>One should not think himself independant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The individual is always under His control.</p>
<p>Therefore his duty is to surrender, and that is the injunction of the next verse.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O scion of Bharata, surrender unto Him utterly.</p>
<p>By His grace you will attain transcendental peace and the supreme and eternal abode.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A living entity should therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is situated in everyone's heart, and that will relieve him from all kinds of miseries of this material existence.</p>
<p>By such surrender, one will not only be released from all miseries in this life, but at the end he will reach the Supreme God.</p>
<p>The transcendental world is described in the Vedic literature as tad visnoh paramam padam.</p>
<p>Since all of creation is the kingdom of God, everything material is actually spiritual, but paramam padam specifically refers to the eternal abode, which is called the spiritual sky or Vaikuntha.</p>
<p>In the Fifteenth Chapter of Bhagavad-gita it is stated: "Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivistah."</p>
<p>The Lord is seated in everyone's heart, so this recommendation that one should surrender unto the Supersoul sitting within means that one should surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna has already been accepted by Arjuna as the Supreme.</p>
<p>He was accepted in the Tenth Chapter as param brahma param dhama.</p>
<p>Arjuna has accepted Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the supreme abode of all living entities, not only because of his personal experience but also because of the evidences of great authorities like Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa.</p>

<p>The Lord has already explained to Arjuna the knowledge of brahmabhuta.</p>
<p>One who is in the brahma-bhuta condition is joyful; he never laments, nor does he desire anything.</p>
<p>That is due to confidential knowledge.</p>
<p>Krsna also discloses knowledge of the Supersoul.</p>
<p>This is also Brahman knowledge, knowledge of Brahman, but it is superior.</p>
<p>Here Lord Krsna telIs Arjuna that he can do as he chooses.</p>
<p>God does not interfere with the little independence of the living entity.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, the Lord has explained in all respects how one can elevate his living condition.</p>
<p>The best advice imparted to Arjuna is to surrender unto the Supersoul seated within his heart.</p>
<p>By right discrimination, one should agree to act according to the order of the Supersoul.</p>
<p>That will help one become situated constantly in Krsna consciousness, the highest perfectional stage of human life.</p>
<p>Arjuna is being directly ordered by the Personality of Godhead to fight.</p>
<p>Surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in the best interest of the living entities.</p>
<p>It is not for the interest of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Before surrendering, one is free to deliberate on this subject as far as the intelligence goes; that is the best way to accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Such instruction comes also through the spiritual master, the bona fide representative of Krsna.</p>

<p>The Lord has given Arjuna confidential knowledge of the Supersoul within everyone's heart, and now He is giving the most confidential part of this knowledge: just surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ninth Chapter He has said, "Just always think of Me."</p>
<p>The same instruction is repeated here to stress the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>This essence is not understood by a common man, but by one who is actually very dear to Krsna, a pure devotee of Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the most important instruction in all Vedic literature.</p>
<p>What Krsna is saying in this connection is the most essential part of knowledge, and it should be carried out not only by Arjuna but by all living entities.</p>

<p>The most confidential part of knowledge is that one should become a pure devotee of Krsna and always think of Him and act for Him.</p>
<p>One should not become an official meditator.</p>
<p>Life should be so molded that one will always have the chance to think of Krsna.</p>
<p>One should always act in such a way that all his daily activities are in connection with Krsna.</p>
<p>He should arrange his life in such a way that throughout the twenty-four hours he cannot but think of Krsna.</p>
<p>And the Lord's promise is that anyone who is in such pure Krsna consciousness will certainly return to the abode of Krsna, where he will be engaged in the association of Krsna face to face.</p>
<p>This most confidential part of knowledge is spoken to Arjuna because he is the dear friend of Krsna.</p>
<p>Everyone who follows the path of Arjuna can become a dear friend to Krsna and obtain the same perfection as Arjuna.</p>
<p>These words stress that one should concentrate his mind upon Krsna--the very form with two hands carrying a flute, the bluish boy with a beautiful face and peacock feathers in His hair.</p>
<p>There are descriptions of Krsna found in the Brahma-samhita and other literatures.</p>
<p>One should fix his mind on this original form of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>He should not even divert his attention to other forms of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord has multi-forms, as Visnu, Narayana, Rama, Varaha, etc., but a devotee should concentrate his mind on the form that was present before Arjuna.</p>
<p>Concentration of the mind on the form of Krsna constitutes the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is disclosed to Arjuna because Arjuna is the most dear friend of Krsna's.</p>

<p>Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.</p>
<p>I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>Do not fear.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord has described various kinds of knowledge, processes of religion, knowledge of the Supreme Brahman, knowledge of the Supersoul, knowledge of the different types of orders and statuses of social life, knowledge of the renounced order of life, knowledge of nonattachment, sense and mind control, meditation, etc.</p>
<p>He has described in so many ways different types of religion.</p>
<p>Now, in summarizing Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that Arjuna should give up all the processes that have been explained to him; he should simply surrender to Krsna.</p>
<p>That surrender will save him from all kinds of sinful reactions, for the Lord personally promises to protect him.</p>
<p>In the Eighth Chapter it was said that only one who has become free from all sinful reactions can take to the worship of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus one may think that unless he is free from all sinful reactions he cannot take to the surrendering process.</p>
<p>To such doubts it is here said that even if one is not free from all sinful reactions, simply by the process of surrendering to Sri Krsna he is automatically freed.</p>
<p>There is no need of strenuous effort to free oneself from sinful reactions.</p>
<p>One should unhesitatingly accept Krsna as the supreme savior of all living entities.</p>
<p>With faith and love, one should surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>According to the devotional process, one should simply accept such religious principles that will lead ultimately to the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>One may perform a particular occupational duty according to his position in the social order, but if by executing his duty one does not come to the point of Krsna consciousness, all his activities are in vain.</p>
<p>Anything that does not lead to the perfectional stage of Krsna consciousness should be avoided.</p>
<p>One should be confident that in all circumstances Krsna will protect him from all difficulties.</p>
<p>There is no need of thinking how one should keep the body and soul together.</p>
<p>Krsna will see to that.</p>
<p>One should always think himself helpless and should consider Krsna the only basis for his progress in life.</p>
<p>As soon as one seriously engages himself in devotional service to the Lord in full Krsna consciousness, at once he becomes freed from all contamination of material nature.</p>
<p>There are different processes of religion and purificatory processes by cultivation of knowledge, meditation in the mystic yoga system, etc., but one who surrenders unto Krsna does not have to execute so many methods.</p>
<p>That simple surrender unto Krsna will save him from unnecessarily wasting time.</p>
<p>One can thus make all progress at once and be freed from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>One should be attracted by the beautiful vision of Krsna.</p>
<p>His name is Krsna because He is all-attractive.</p>
<p>One who becomes attracted by the beautiful, all-powerful, omnipotent vision of Krsna is fortunate.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of transcendentalists--some of them are attached to the impersonal Brahman vision, some of them are attracted by the Supersoul feature, etc., but one who is attracted to the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, above all, one who is attracted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Krsna Himself, is the most perfect transcendentalist.</p>
<p>In other words, devotional service to Krsna, in full consciousness, is the most confidential part of knowledge, and this is the essence of the whole Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Karma-yogis, empiric philosophers, mystics, and devotees are all called transcendentalists, but one who is a pure devotee is the best of all.</p>
<p>The particular words used here, ma sucah, "Don't fear, don't hesitate, don't worry," are very significant.</p>
<p>One may be perplexed as to how one can give up all kinds of religious forms and simply surrender unto Krsna, but such worry is useless.</p>

<p>This confidential knowledge may not be explained to those who are not austere, or devoted, or engaged in devotional service, nor to one who is envious of Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Persons who have not undergone the austerities of the religious process, who have never attempted devotional service in Krsna consciousness, who have not tended a pure devotee, and especially those who are conscious of Krsna as a historical personality or who are envious of the greatness of Krsna, should not be told this most confidential part of knowledge.</p>
<p>It is, however, sometimes found that even demoniac persons who are envious of Krsna, worshiping Krsna in a different way, take to the profession of explaining Bhagavad-gita in a different way to make business, but anyone who desires actually to understand Krsna must avoid such commentaries on Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Actually the purpose of Bhagavad-gita is not understandable to those who are sensuous--even if one is not sensuous but is strictly following the disciplines enjoined in the Vedic scripture, if he is not a devotee, he also cannot understand Krsna.</p>
<p>Even when one poses himself as a devotee of Krsna, but is not engaged in Krsna conscious activities, he also cannot understand Krsna.</p>
<p>There are many persons who envy Krsna because He has explained in Bhagavad-gita that He is the Supreme and that nothing is above Him or equal to Him.</p>
<p>There are many persons who are envious of Krsna.</p>
<p>Such persons should not be told of Bhagavad-gita, for they cannot understand.</p>
<p>There is no possibility of faithless persons' understanding Bhagavad-gita and Krsna.</p>
<p>Without understanding Krsna from the authority of a pure devotee, one should not try to comment upon Bhagavad-gita.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>And one who listens with faith and without envy becomes free from sinful reaction and attains to the planets where the pious dwell.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the 67th verse of this chapter, the Lord explicitly forbade the Gita's being spoken to those who are envious of the Lord.</p>
<p>In other words, Bhagavad-gita is for the devotees only, but it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class all the students are not expected to be devotees.</p>
<p>Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that although everyone is not a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious of Krsna.</p>
<p>They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated.</p>
<p>Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-gita, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities.</p>
<p>Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>Generally those who are free from sinful reaction are righteous.</p>
<p>Such persons very easily take to Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The word punya-karmanam is very significant here.</p>
<p>This refers to the performance of great sacrifice.</p>
<p>Those who are righteous in performing devotional service but who are not pure can attain the planetary system of the polestar, or Dhruvaloka, where Dhruva Maharaja is presiding.</p>
<p>He is a great devotee of the Lord, and he has a special planet which is called the polestar.</p>

<p>The constitutional position of a living entity, represented by Arjuna, is that he has to act according to the order of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>He is meant for self-discipline.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord, he becomes the liberated servant of God.</p>
<p>The living entity's constitutional position is to be servitor; he either has to serve the illusory maya or the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>If he serves the Supreme Lord, he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage.</p>
<p>In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world.</p>
<p>He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world.</p>
<p>This is called illusion.</p>
<p>When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires.</p>
<p>The last illusion, the last snare of maya to trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God.</p>
<p>The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God.</p>
<p>He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider.</p>
<p>So that is the last snare of illusion.</p>
<p>Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understand Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order.</p>
<p>The word mohah is very important in this verse.</p>
<p>Mohah refers to that which is opposed to knowledge.</p>
<p>Actually real knowledge is the understanding that every living being is eternally servitor of the Lord, but instead of thinking oneself in that position, the living entity thinks that he is not servant, that he is the master of this material world, for he wants to lord it over the material nature.</p>
<p>That is his illusion.</p>
<p>This illusion can be overcome by the mercy of the Lord or by the mercy of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>When that illusion is over, one agrees to act in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is acting according to Krsna's order.</p>
<p>A conditioned soul illusioned by the external energy of matter does not know that the Supreme Lord is the master who is full of knowledge and who is the proprietor of everything.</p>
<p>Whatever He desires He can bestow upon His devotees; He is the friend of everyone, and He is especially inclined to His devotee.</p>
<p>He is the controller of this material nature and of all living entities.</p>
<p>He is also the controller of inexhaustible time, and He is full of all opulences and all potencies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead can even give Himself to the devotee.</p>
<p>One who does not know Him is under the spell of illusion; he does not become a devotee, but a servitor of maya.</p>
<p>Arjuna, however, after hearing Bhagavad-gita from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, became free from all illusion.</p>
<p>He could understand that Krsna was not only his friend, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>And he understood Krsna factually.</p>
<p>So to study Bhagavad-gita is to understand Krsna factually.</p>
<p>When a person is in full knowledge, he naturally surrenders to Krsna.</p>
<p>When Arjuna understood that it was Krsna's plan to reduce the unnecessary increase of population, he agreed to fight according to Krsna's desire.</p>
<p>He again took up his weapons--his arrows and bow--to fight under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sanjaya said: Thus have I heard the conversation of two great souls, Krsna and Arjuna.</p>
<p>And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of Bhagavad-gita, Dhrtarastra inquired from his secretary Sanjaya, "What happened in the Battlefield of Kuruksetra?" The entire study was related to the heart of Sanjaya by the grace of his spiritual master, Vyasa.</p>
<p>He thus explained the theme of the battlefield.</p>
<p>The conversation was wonderful because such an important conversation between two great souls never took place before and would not take place again.</p>
<p>It is wonderful because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is speaking about Himself and His energies to the living entity, Arjuna, a great devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>If we follow in the footsteps of Arjuna to understand Krsna, then our life will be happy and successful.</p>
<p>Sanjaya realized this, and as he began to understand it, he related the conversation to Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>Now it is concluded that wherever there is Krsna and Arjuna, there is victory.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By the mercy of Vyasa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism, Krsna, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Vyasa was the spiritual master of Sanjaya, and Sanjaya admits that it was by his mercy that he could understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This means that one has to understand Krsna not directly but through the medium of the spiritual master.</p>
<p>The spiritual master is the transparent medium, although it is true that the experience is direct.</p>
<p>This is the mystery of the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>When the spiritual master is bona fide, then one can hear Bhagavad-gita directly, as Arjuna heard it.</p>
<p>There are many mystics and yogis all over the world, but Krsna is the master of all yoga systems.</p>
<p>Krsna's instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gita--surrender unto Krsna.</p>
<p>One who does so is the topmost yogi.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.</p>
<p>Yoginam api sarvesam.</p>
<p>Narada is the direct disciple of Krsna and the spiritual master of Vyasa.</p>
<p>Therefore Vyasa is as bona fide as Arjuna because he comes in the disciplic succession, and Sanjaya is the direct disciple of Vyasa.</p>
<p>Therefore by the grace of Vyasa, his senses were purified, and he could see and hear Krsna directly.</p>
<p>One who directly hears Krsna can understand this confidential knowledge.</p>
<p>If one does not come to the disciplic succession, he cannot hear Krsna; therefore his knowledge is always imperfect, at least as far as understanding Bhagavad-gita is concerned.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, all the yoga systems, karma-yoga, jnana-yoga and bhakti-yoga, are explained.</p>
<p>Krsna is the master of all such mysticism.</p>
<p>It is to be understood, however, that as Arjuna was fortunate enough to understand Krsna directly, similarly, by the grace of Vyasa, Sanjaya was also able to hear Krsna directly.</p>
<p>Actually there is no difference in hearing directly from Krsna or hearing directly from Krsna via a bona fide spiritual master like Vyasa.</p>
<p>The spiritual master is the representative of Vyasadeva also.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic system, on the birthday of the spiritual master, the disciples conduct the ceremony called Vyasa-puja.</p>

<p>O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between Krsna and Arjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The understanding of Bhagavad-gita is so transcendental that anyone who becomes conversant with the topics of Arjuna and Krsna becomes righteous, and he cannot forget such talks.</p>
<p>This is the transcendental position of spiritual life.</p>
<p>In other words, one who hears the Gita from the right source, directly from Krsna, attains full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The result of Krsna consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment.</p>

<p>O King, when I remember the wonderful form of Lord Krsna, I am struck with even greater wonder, and I rejoice again and again.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that Sanjaya also, by the grace of Vyasa, could see the universal form of Krsna exhibited to Arjuna.</p>
<p>It is, of course, said that Lord Krsna never exhibited such a form before.</p>
<p>It was exhibited to Arjuna only, yet some great devotees could also see the universal form of Krsna when it was shown to Arjuna, and Vyasa was one of them.</p>
<p>He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation of Krsna.</p>
<p>Vyasa disclosed this to his disciple, Sanjaya, who remembered that wonderful form of Krsna exhibited to Arjuna and enjoyed it repeatedly.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Wherever there is Krsna, the master of all mystics, and wherever there is Arjuna, the supreme archer, there will also certainly be opulence, victory, extraordinary power, and morality.</p>
<p>That is my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Bhagavad-gita began with an inquiry of Dhrtarastra.</p>
<p>He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors like Bhisma, Drona and Karna.</p>
<p>He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side.</p>
<p>But, after describing the scene in the battlefield, Sanjaya told the King, "You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that where Krsna and Arjuna are present, there will be all good fortune."</p>
<p>He directly confirmed that Dhrtarastra could not expect victory for his side.</p>
<p>Victory was certain for the side of Arjuna because Krsna was there.</p>
<p>Krsna's acceptance of the post of charioteer for Arjuna was an exhibition of another opulence.</p>
<p>Krsna is full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them.</p>
<p>There are many instances of such renunciation, for Krsna is also the master of renunciation.</p>
<p>The fight was actually between Duryodhana and Yudhisthira.</p>
<p>Arjuna was fighting on behalf of his elder brother, Yudhisthira.</p>
<p>Because Krsna and Arjuna were on the side of Yudhisthira, Yudhisthira's victory was certain.</p>
<p>The battle was to decide who would rule the world, and Sanjaya predicted that the power would be transferred to Yudhisthira.</p>
<p>It is also predicted here that Yudhisthira, after gaining victory in this battle, would flourish more and more because he was not only righteous and pious, but he was a strict moralist.</p>
<p>He never spoke a lie during his life.</p>
<p>There are many less intelligent persons who take Bhagavad-gita to be a discussion of topics between two friends in a battlefield.</p>
<p>But such a book cannot be scripture.</p>
<p>Some may protest that Krsna incited Arjuna to fight, which is immoral, but the reality of the situation is clearly stated: Bhagavad-gita is the supreme instruction in morality.</p>
<p>The supreme instruction of morality is stated in the Ninth Chapter, in the thirty-fourth verse: manmana bhava mad-bhaktah.</p>
<p>One must become a devotee of Krsna, and the essence of all religion is to surrender unto Krsna, as stated, Sarva-dharman.</p>
<p>The instructions of Bhagavad-gita constitute the supreme process of religion and of morality.</p>
<p>All other processes may be purifying and may lead to this process, but the last instruction of the Gita is the last word in all morality and religion: surrender unto Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the verdict of the Eighteenth Chapter.</p>
<p>From Bhagavad-gita we can understand that to realize oneself by philosophical speculation and by meditation is one process, but to fully surrender unto Krsna is the highest perfection.</p>
<p>This is the essence of the teachings of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The path of regulative principles according to the orders of social life and according to the different courses of religion may be a confidential path of knowledge in as far as the rituals of religion are confidential, but one is still involved with meditation and cultivation of knowledge.</p>
<p>Surrender unto Krsna in devotional service in full Krsna consciousness is the most confidential instruction and is the essence of the Eighteenth Chapter.</p>
<p>Another feature of Bhagavad-gita is that the actual truth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>Absolute Truth is realized in three features--impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>Perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth means perfect knowledge of Krsna.</p>
<p>If one understands Krsna, then all the departments of knowledge are part and parcel of that understanding.</p>
<p>Krsna is transcendental, for He is always situated in His eternal internal potency.</p>
<p>The living entities are manifested and are divided into two classes, eternally conditioned and eternally liberated.</p>
<p>Such living entities are innumerable, and they are considered fundamental parts of Krsna.</p>
<p>Material energy is manifested into twenty-four divisions.</p>
<p>The creation is effected by eternal time, and it is created and dissolved by external energy.</p>
<p>This manifestation of the cosmic world repeatedly becomes visible and invisible.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita five principal subject matters have been discussed: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, material nature, the living entities, eternal time and all kinds of activities.</p>
<p>All of these are dependant on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.</p>
<p>All conceptions of the Absolute Truth, namely, impersonal Brahman, localized Paramatma, or any other transcendental conception, exist within the category of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Although superficially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entity, material nature and time appear to be different, nothing is different from the Supreme.</p>
<p>But the Supreme is always different from everything.</p>
<p>Lord Caitanya's philosophy is that of "inconceivably one and different."</p>
<p>This system of philosophy constitutes perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The living entity in his original position is pure spirit.</p>
<p>He is just like an atomic particle of the Supreme Spirit.</p>
<p>The conditioned living entity, however, is the marginal energy of the Lord; he tends to be in contact with both the material energy and the spiritual energy.</p>
<p>In other words, the living entity is situated between the two energies of the Lord, and because he belongs to the superior energy of the Lord, he has a particle of independence.</p>
<p>By proper use of that independence he comes under the direct order of Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus he attains his normal condition in the pleasure-giving potency.</p>
