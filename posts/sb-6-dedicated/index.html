<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereupon that man who spoke on different subjects with thousands of meanings and who fought on thousands of battlefields and protected thousands of men, stopped speaking and, being completely freed from all bondage, withdrew his mind from everything else and fixed his wide-open eyes upon the original Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, who stood before him, four-handed, dressed in yellow garments that glittered and shined.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the momentous hour of leaving his material body, Bhismadeva set the glorious example concerning the important function of the human form of life.</p>
<p>The subject matter which attracts the dying man becomes the beginning of his next life.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one is absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna, he is sure to go back to Godhead without any doubt.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gita (8.5–15):</p>
<p>5:</p>
<p>And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature.</p>
<p>Of this there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail 7:</p>
<p>Therefore, Arjuna, you should always think of Me in the form of Krsna and at the same time carry out your prescribed duty of fighting.</p>
<p>With your activities dedicated to Me and your mind and intelligence fixed on Me, you will attain Me without doubt.</p>
<p>He who meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his mind constantly engaged in remembering Me, undeviated from the path, he, O Partha (Arjuna), is sure to reach Me 9:</p>
<p>One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as the one who knows everything, as He who is the oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller than the smallest, who is the maintainer of everything, who is beyond all material conception, who is inconceivable, and who is always a person.</p>
<p>He is luminous like the sun and, being transcendental, is beyond this material nature 10:</p>
<p>One who, at the time of death, fixes his life air between the eyebrows and in full devotion engages himself in remembering the Supreme Lord will certainly attain to the Supreme Personality of Godhead 11:</p>
<p>Persons learned in the Vedas, who utter omkara and who are great sages in the renounced order, enter into Brahman.</p>
<p>Desiring such perfection, one practices celibacy.</p>
<p>I shall now explain to you this process by which one may attain salvation 12:</p>
<p>The yogic situation is that of detachment from all sensual engagements.</p>
<p>Closing all the doors of the senses and fixing the mind on the heart and the life air at the top of the head, one establishes himself in yoga 13:</p>
<p>After being situated in this yoga practice and vibrating the sacred syllable om, the supreme combination of letters, if one thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and quits his body, he will certainly reach the spiritual planets 14:</p>
<p>For one who remembers Me without deviation, I am easy to obtain, O son of Prtha, because of his constant engagement in devotional service 15:</p>
<p>After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.</p>
<p>Sri Bhismadeva attained the perfection of quitting his body at will and was fortunate enough to have Lord Krsna, the object of his attention, personally present at the time of death.</p>
<p>He therefore fixed his open eyes upon Him.</p>
<p>He wanted to see Sri Krsna for a long time out of his spontaneous love for Him.</p>
<p>Because he was a pure devotee, he had very little to do with the detailed performance of yogic principles.</p>
<p>Simple bhakti-yoga is enough to bring about perfection.</p>
<p>Therefore, the ardent desire of Bhismadeva was to see the person of Lord Krsna, the most lovable object, and by the grace of the Lord, Sri Bhismadeva had this opportunity at the last stage of his breathing.</p>
