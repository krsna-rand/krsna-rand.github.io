My respectful obeisances unto you friend. Thank you for making time to purify your mind.

According to the sweet will of Sri Guru Maharaja, the spiritual master of the world, I was allowed to provided this service so please enjoy your daily dose of nectar.

Inspired by a devotee on Reddit who loves Govinda. :)

[Nikola](http://www.getnikola.com) and [awk](http://matt.might.net/articles/sculpting-text/) were used to generate the website and selections respectively.

**Title explanation:** *Bg/SB:service:22/595* = Bhagavad-gita/Srimad Bhagavatam tag 22 of service from 595 total mentions. 

Themes or *tags* can be requested. Search for your own tag @ [Random](../../srch.app/index.html).

Every sentence is its own paragraph for easier absorption and reading. Many things are done one at a time and realize these instructions as code for the human hardware. You can focus on that one sentence, define words you don't know and truly relish it.

Haribol!
