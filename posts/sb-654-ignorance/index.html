<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aniyatam—let it be brought; are—oh; vetram—the stick; asmakam—of us; ayasaskarah—who is bringing defamation; kula-angarasya—of he who is like a cinder in the dynasty; durbuddheh—having bad intelligence; caturthah—the fourth; asya—for him; uditah—declared; damah—punishment (the stick, argumentum ad baculum).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Oh, please bring me a stick! This Prahlada is damaging our name and fame.</p>
<p>Because of his bad intelligence, he has become like a cinder in the dynasty of the demons.</p>
<p>Now he needs to be treated by the fourth of the four kinds of political diplomacy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In political affairs, when a person disobediently agitates against the government, four principles are used to suppress him—legal orders, pacification, the offer of a post, or, finally, weapons.</p>
<p>When there are no other arguments, he is punished.</p>
<p>In logic, this is called argumentum ad baculum.</p>
<p>When the two seminal brahmanas Sanda and Amarka failed to extract from Prahlada Maharaja the cause for his having opinions different from those of his father, they called for a stick with which to chastise him to satisfy their master, Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Because Prahlada had become a devotee, they considered him to be contaminated by bad intelligence and to be the worst descendant in the family of demons.</p>
<p>As it is said, where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise.</p>
<p>In a society or family in which everyone is a demon, for someone to become a Vaisnava is certainly folly.</p>
<p>Thus Prahlada Maharaja was charged with bad intelligence because he was among demons, including his teachers, who were supposedly brahmanas.</p>
<p>The members of our Krsna consciousness movement are in a position similar to that of Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>All over the world, ninety-nine percent of the people are godless demons, and therefore our preaching of Krsna consciousness, following in the footsteps of Prahlada Maharaja, is always hampered by many impediments.</p>
<p>Because of their fault of being devotees, the American boys who have sacrificed everything for preaching Krsna consciousness are charged with being members of the CIA.</p>
<p>Moreover, the seminal brahmanas in India, who say that one can become a brahmana only if born in a brahmana family, charge us with ruining the Hindu system of religion.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact is that one becomes a brahmana by qualification.</p>
<p>Because we are training Europeans and Americans to become qualified and are awarding them brahminical status, we are being charged with destroying the Hindu religion.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, confronting all kinds of difficulties, we must spread the Krsna consciousness movement with great determination, like that of Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>In spite of being the son of the demon Hiranyakasipu, Prahlada never feared the chastisements of the seminal brahmana sons of a demoniac father.</p>
