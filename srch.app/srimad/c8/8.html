<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#81" id="81">8.1</a></h3>
<p>First of all, let me offer my humble, respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master, His Divine Grace Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhupada.</p>
<p>Sometime in the year 1935 when His Divine Grace was staying at Radha-kunda, I went to see him from Bombay.</p>
<p>At that time, he gave me many important instructions in regard to constructing temples and publishing books.</p>
<p>He personally told me that publishing books is more important than constructing temples.</p>
<p>Of course, those same instructions remained within my mind for many years.</p>
<p>In 1944 I began publishing my Back to Godhead, and when I retired from family life in 1958 I began publishing Srimad-Bhagavatam in Delhi.</p>
<p>When three parts of Srimad-Bhagavatam had been published in India, I then started for the United States of America on the thirteenth of August, 1965.</p>
<p>I am continuously trying to publish books, as suggested by my spiritual master.</p>
<p>Now, in this year, 1976, I have completed the Seventh Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and a summary of the Tenth Canto has already been published as Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Still, the Eighth Canto, Ninth Canto, Tenth Canto, Eleventh Canto and Twelfth Canto are yet to be published.</p>
<p>On this occasion, therefore, I am praying to my spiritual master to give me strength to finish this work.</p>
<p>I am neither a great scholar nor a great devotee; I am simply a humble servant of my spiritual master, and to the best of my ability I am trying to please him by publishing these books, with the cooperation of my disciples in America.</p>
<p>Fortunately, scholars all over the world are appreciating these publications.</p>
<p>Let us cooperatively publish more and more volumes of Srimad-Bhagavatam just to please His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura.</p>
<p>This First Chapter of the Eighth Canto may be summarized as a description of four Manus, namely Svayambhuva, Svarocisa, Uttama and Tamasa.</p>
<p>After hearing descriptions of the dynasty of Svayambhuva Manu until the end of the Seventh Canto, Maharaja Pariksit desired to know about other Manus.</p>
<p>He desired to understand how the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends—not only in the past but at the present and in the future—and how He acts in various pastimes as Manu.</p>
<p>Since Pariksit Maharaja was eager to know all this, Sukadeva Gosvami gradually described all the Manus, beginning with the six Manus who had appeared in the past.</p>
<p>The first Manu was Svayambhuva Manu.</p>
<p>His two daughters, namely Akuti and Devahuti, gave birth to two sons, named Yajna and Kapila respectively.</p>
<p>Because Sukadeva Gosvami had already described the activities of Kapila in the Third Canto, he now described the activities of Yajna.</p>
<p>The original Manu, along with his wife, Satarupa, went into the forest to practice austerities on the bank of the River Sunanda.</p>
<p>They practiced austerities for a hundred years, and then Manu, in a trance, formed prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Raksasas and asuras then attempted to devour him, but Yajna, accompanied by his sons the Yamas and the demigods, killed them.</p>
<p>Then Yajna personally took the post of Indra, the King of the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>The second Manu, whose name was Svarocisa, was the son of Agni, and His sons were headed by Dyumat, Susena and Rocismat.</p>
<p>In the age of this Manu, Rocana became Indra, the ruler of the heavenly planets, and there were many demigods, headed by Tusita.</p>
<p>There were also many saintly persons, such as Urja and Stambha.</p>
<p>Among them was Vedasira, whose wife, Tusita, gave birth to Vibhu.</p>
<p>Vibhu instructed eighty-eight thousand drdha-vratas, or saintly persons, on self-control and austerity.</p>
<p>Uttama, the son of Priyavrata, was the third Manu.</p>
<p>Among his sons were Pavana, Srnjaya and Yajnahotra.</p>
<p>During the reign of this Manu, the sons of Vasistha, headed by Pramada, became the seven saintly persons.</p>
<p>The Satyas, Devasrutas and Bhadras became the demigods, and Satyajit became Indra.</p>
<p>From the womb of Sunrta, the wife of Dharma, the Lord appeared as Satyasena, and He killed all the Yaksas and Raksasas who were fighting with Satyajit.</p>
<p>Tamasa, the brother of the third Manu, was the fourth Manu, and he had ten sons, including Prthu, Khyati, Nara and Ketu.</p>
<p>During his reign, the Satyakas, Haris, Viras and others were demigods, the seven great saints were headed by Jyotirdhama, and Trisikha became Indra.</p>
<p>Harimedha begot a son named Hari in the womb of his wife Harini.</p>
<p>This Hari, an incarnation of God, saved the devotee Gajendra.</p>
<p>This incident is described as gajendra-moksana.</p>
<p>At the end of this chapter, Pariksit Maharaja particularly asks about this incident.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pariksit said: O my lord, my spiritual master, now I have fully heard from Your Grace about the dynasty of Svayambhuva Manu.</p>
<p>But there are also other Manus, and I want to hear about their dynasties.</p>
<p>Kindly describe them to us.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>manvantare—during the change of manvantaras (one Manu following another); hareh—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; janma—appearance; karmani—and activities; ca—also; mahiyasah—of the supremely glorified; grnanti—describe; kavayah—the great learned persons who have perfect intelligence; brahman—O learned brahmana (Sukadeva Gosvami); tani—all of them; nah—to us; vada—please describe; srnvatam—who are very eager to hear.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O learned brahmana, Sukadeva Gosvami, the great learned persons who are completely intelligent describe the activities and appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead during the various manvantaras.</p>
<p>We are very eager to hear about these narrations.</p>
<p>Kindly describe them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has different varieties of incarnations, including the guna-avataras, manvantara-avataras, lila-avataras and yuga-avataras, all of which are described in the sastras.</p>
<p>Without reference to the sastras there can be no question of accepting anyone as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, as especially mentioned here, grnanti kavayah: the descriptions of various incarnations are accepted by great learned scholars with perfect intelligence.</p>
<p>At the present time, especially in India, so many rascals are claiming to be incarnations, and people are being misled.</p>
<p>Therefore, the identity of an incarnation should be confirmed by the descriptions of the sastras and by wonderful activities.</p>
<p>As described in this verse by the word mahiyasah, the activities of an incarnation are not ordinary magic or jugglery, but are wonderful activities.</p>
<p>Thus any incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be supported by the statements of the sastra and must actually perform wonderful activities.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja was eager to hear about the Manus of different ages.</p>
<p>There are fourteen Manus during a day of Brahma, and the age of each Manu lasts for seventy-one yugas.</p>
<p>Thus there are thousands of Manus during the life of Brahma.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat—whatever activities; yasmin—in a particular age; antare—manvantara; brahman—O great brahmana; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; visva-bhavanah—who has created this cosmic manifestation; krtavan—has done; kurute—is doing; karta—and will do; hi—indeed; atite—in the past; anagate—in the future; adya—at the present; va—either.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O learned brahmana, kindly describe to us whatever activities the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created this cosmic manifestation, has performed in the past manvantaras, is performing at present, and will perform in the future manvantaras.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Supreme Personality of Godhead said that both He and the other living entities present on the battlefield had existed in the past, they existed at present, and they would continue to exist in the future.</p>
<p>Past, present and future always exist, both for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and for ordinary living entities.</p>
<p>Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam.</p>
<p>Both the Lord and the living entities are eternal and sentient, but the difference is that the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the creator of everything, and although the living entities are not created but exist with the Lord eternally, their bodies are created, whereas the Supreme Lord’s body is never created.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the Supreme Lord and His body, but the conditioned soul, although eternal, is different from his body.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>viraktah—without attachment; kama-bhogesu—in sense gratification (in grhastha life); satarupa-patih—the husband of Satarupa, namely Svayambhuva Manu; prabhuh—who was the master or king of the world; visrjya—after renouncing totally; rajyam—his kingdom; tapase—for practicing austerities; sa-bharyah—with his wife; vanam—the forest; avisat—entered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu, the husband of Satarupa, was by nature not at all attached to enjoyment of the senses.</p>
<p>Thus he gave up his kingdom of sense enjoyment and entered the forest with his wife to practice austerities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.2), evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo viduh: The supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way All the Manus were perfect kings.</p>
<p>They were rajarsis.</p>
<p>In other words, although they held posts as kings of the world, they were as good as great saints.</p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu, for example, was the emperor of the world, yet he had no desire for sense gratification.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of monarchy.</p>
<p>The king of the country or the emperor of the empire must be so trained that by nature he renounces sense gratification.</p>
<p>It is not that because one becomes king he should unnecessarily spend money for sense gratification.</p>
<p>As soon as kings became degraded, spending money for sense gratification, they were lost.</p>
<p>Similarly, at the present moment, monarchy having been lost, the people have created democracy, which is also failing.</p>
<p>Now, by the laws of nature, the time is coming when dictatorship will put the citizens into more and more difficulty.</p>
<p>If the king or dictator individually, or the members of the government collectively, cannot maintain the state or kingdom according to the rules of Manu-samhita, certainly their government will not endure.</p>

<p>Lord Manu said: The supreme living being has created this material world of animation; it is not that He was created by this material world.</p>
<p>When everything is silent, the Supreme Being stays awake as a witness.</p>
<p>The living entity does not know Him, but He knows everything.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is a distinction between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entities.</p>
<p>Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic version, the Lord is the supreme eternal, the supreme living being.</p>
<p>The difference between the Supreme Being and the ordinary living being is that when this material world is annihilated, all the living entities remain silent in oblivion, in a dreaming or unconscious condition, whereas the Supreme Being stays awake as the witness of everything.</p>
<p>This material world is created, it stays for some time, and then it is annihilated.</p>
<p>Throughout these changes, however, the Supreme Being remains awake.</p>
<p>In the material condition of all living entities, there are three stages of dreaming.</p>
<p>When the material world is awake and put in working order, this is a kind of dream, a waking dream.</p>
<p>When the living entities go to sleep, they dream again.</p>
<p>And when unconscious at the time of annihilation, when this material world is unmanifested, they enter another stage of dreaming.</p>
<p>At any stage in the material world, therefore, they are all dreaming.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world, however, everything is awake.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Within this universe, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Supersoul feature is present everywhere, wherever there are animate or inanimate beings.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should accept only that which is allotted to him; one should not desire to infringe upon the property of others.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Having described the situation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as transcendental, Svayambhuva Manu, for the instruction of the sons and grandsons in his dynasty, is now describing all the property of the universe as belonging to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Manu’s instructions are not only for his own sons and grandsons, but for all of human society.</p>
<p>The word ma—or, in Sanskrit, manusya—has been derived from the name Manu, for all the members of human society are descendants of the original Manu.</p>
<p>Manu is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (4.1), where the Lord says:</p>

<p>I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku Svayambhuva Manu and Vaivasvata Manu have similar duties.</p>
<p>Vaivasvata Manu was born of the sun-god, Vivasvan, and his son was Iksvaku, the King of the earth.</p>
<p>Since Manu is understood to be the original father of humanity, human society should follow his instructions.</p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu instructs that whatever exists, not only in the spiritual world but even within this material world, is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present everywhere as the Superconsciousness.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (13.3), ksetra jnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: in every field—in other words, in every body—the Supreme Lord is existing as the Supersoul.</p>
<p>The individual soul is given a body in which to live and act according to the instructions of the Supreme Person, and therefore the Supreme Person also exists within every body.</p>
<p>We should not think that we are independent; rather, we should understand that we are allotted a certain portion of the total property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This understanding will lead to perfect communism.</p>
<p>Communists think in terms of their own nations, but the spiritual communism instructed here is not only nationwide but universal.</p>
<p>Nothing belongs to any nation or any individual person; everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That is the meaning of this verse.</p>
<p>Atmavasyam idam visvam: whatever exists within this universe is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The modern communistic theory, and also the idea of the United Nations, can be reformed—indeed, rectified—by the understanding that everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord is not a creation of our intelligence; rather, He has created us.</p>
<p>Atmavasyam idam visvam.</p>
<p>Isavasyam idam sarvam.</p>
<p>This universal communism can solve all the problems of the world.</p>
<p>One should learn from the Vedic literature that one’s body is also not the property of the individual soul, but is given to the individual soul according to his karma.</p>
<p>Karmana daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye (SB 3.31.1).</p>
<p>The 8,400,000 different bodily forms are machines given to the individual soul.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):</p>
<p>isvarah sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati</p>
<p>bhramayan sarva-bhutani</p>
<p>yantrarudhani mayaya</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy The Lord, as the Supersoul, sits in everyone’s heart and observes the various desires of the individual soul.</p>
<p>The Lord is so merciful that He gives the living entity the opportunity to enjoy varieties of desires in suitable bodies, which are nothing but machines (yantrarudhani mayaya).</p>
<p>These machines are manufactured by the material ingredients of the external energy, and thus the living entity enjoys or suffers according to his desires.</p>
<p>This opportunity is given by the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Everything belongs to the Supreme, and therefore one should not usurp another’s property.</p>
<p>We have a tendency to manufacture many things.</p>
<p>Especially nowadays, we are building skyscrapers and developing other material facilities.</p>
<p>We should know, however, that the ingredients of the skyscrapers and machines cannot be manufactured by anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The whole world is nothing but a combination of the five material elements (tejo-vari-mrdam yatha vinimayah).</p>
<p>A skyscraper is a transformation of earth, water and fire.</p>
<p>Earth and water are combined and burnt into bricks by fire, and a skyscraper is essentially a tall construction of bricks.</p>
<p>Although the bricks may be manufactured by man, the ingredients of the bricks are not.</p>
<p>Of course, man, as a manufacturer, may accept a salary from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That is stated here: tena tyaktena bhunjithah.</p>
<p>One may construct a big skyscraper, but neither the constructor, the merchant nor the worker can claim proprietorship.</p>
<p>Proprietorship belongs to the person who has spent for the building.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has manufactured water, earth, air, fire and the sky, and one can use these and take a salary (tena tyaktena bhunjithah).</p>
<p>However, one cannot claim proprietorship.</p>
<p>This is perfect communism.</p>
<p>Our tendency to construct great buildings should be used only for constructing large and valuable temples in which to install the Deity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then our desire for construction will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Since all property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything should be offered to the Lord, and we should take only prasada (tena tyaktena bhunjithah).</p>
<p>We should not fight among ourselves to take more than we need.</p>
<p>As Narada said to Maharaja Yudhisthira:</p>
<p>yavad bhriyeta jatharam</p>
<p>tavat svatvam hi dehinam</p>
<p>adhikam yo ’bhimanyeta</p>
<p>sa steno dandam arhati</p>
<p>One may claim proprietorship to as much wealth as required to maintain body and soul together, but one who desires proprietorship over more than that must be considered a thief, and he deserves to be punished by the laws of nature (Bhag.7.14.8) Of course, we need to be maintained in eating, sleeping, mating and defending (ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithuna), but since the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, has provided these necessities of life for the birds and bees, why not for mankind? There is no need for economic development; everything is provided.</p>
<p>Therefore one should understand that everything belongs to Krsna, and with this idea, one may take prasada.</p>
<p>However, if one interferes with the allotments of others, he is a thief.</p>
<p>We should not accept more than what we actually need.</p>
<p>Therefore, if by chance we get an abundance of money, we should always consider that it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In Krsna consciousness we are getting sufficient money, but we should never think that the money belongs to us; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be equally distributed to the workers, the devotees.</p>
<p>No devotee should claim that any money or property belongs to him.</p>
<p>If one thinks that any portion of property of this huge universe belongs to anyone, he is to be considered a thief and is punishable by the laws of nature.</p>
<p>Daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: no one can surpass the vigilance of material nature or hide his intentions from material nature.</p>
<p>If human society unlawfully claims that the property of the universe, either partially or wholly, belongs to mankind, all of human society will be cursed as a society of thieves and will be punished by the laws of nature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly watches the activities of the world, no one sees Him.</p>
<p>However, one should not think that because no one sees Him, He does not see, for His power to see is never diminished.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone should worship the Supersoul, who always stays with the individual soul as a friend.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Offering prayers to Krsna, Srimati Kuntidevi, the mother of the Pandavas, said, alaksyam sarva-bhutanam antar bahir avasthitam: Krsna, You reside both inside and outside of everything, yet the unintelligent conditioned souls cannot see You In Bhagavad-gita it is said that one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead through jnana-caksusah, eyes of knowledge.</p>
<p>He who opens these eyes of knowledge is called a spiritual master.</p>
<p>Thus we offer our prayers to the spiritual master with the following sloka:</p>
<p>om ajnana-timirandhasya</p>
<p>jnananjana-salakaya</p>
<p>caksur unmilitam yena</p>
<p>tasmai sri-gurave namah</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who with the torchlight of knowledge has opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance (Gautamiya Tantra) The guru’s task is to open the disciple’s eyes of knowledge.</p>
<p>When the disciple is awakened from ignorance to knowledge, he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead everywhere because the Lord actually is everywhere.</p>
<p>Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham.</p>
<p>The Lord resides within this universe, He resides within the hearts of all living entities, and He resides even within the atom.</p>
<p>Because we lack perfect knowledge, we cannot see God, but a little deliberation can help us to see God everywhere.</p>
<p>This requires training.</p>
<p>With a little deliberation, even the most degraded person can perceive the presence of God.</p>
<p>If we take into account whose property is the vast ocean, whose property is the vast land, how the sky exists, how the numberless millions of stars and planets are set in the sky, who has made this universe and whose property it is, we should certainly come to the conclusion that there is a proprietor of everything.</p>
<p>When we claim proprietorship over a certain piece of land, whether individually or for our families or nations, we should also consider how we became the proprietors.</p>
<p>The land was there before our birth, before we came to the land.</p>
<p>How did it become our property? Such deliberation will help us understand that there is a supreme proprietor of everything—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Godhead is always awake.</p>
<p>In the conditioned stage we forget things because we change our bodies, but because the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not change His body, He remembers past, present and future.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.1), imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam: I spoke this science of God—Bhagavad-gita—to the sun-god at least forty million years ago When Arjuna inquired from Krsna how He could remember incidents that had taken place so long ago, the Lord answered that Arjuna was also present at that time.</p>
<p>Because Arjuna is Krsna’s friend, wherever Krsna goes, Arjuna goes.</p>
<p>But the difference is that Krsna remembers everything, whereas the living entity like Arjuna, being a minute particle of the Supreme Lord, forgets.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, the Lord’s vigilance is never diminished.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.15).</p>
<p>Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramatma feature is always present within the hearts of all living entities, and from Him come memory, knowledge and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Svetasvatara Upanisad (4.6) it is therefore said, dva suparna-sayuja sakhaya samanam vrksam parisasvajate: two birds are sitting on the same tree as friends.</p>
<p>One bird is eating the fruit of the tree, and the other is simply observing.</p>
<p>This observing bird is always present as a friend to the eating bird and giving him remembrance of things he wanted to do.</p>
<p>Thus if we take into account the Supreme Personality of Godhead in our daily affairs, we can see Him or at least perceive His presence everywhere.</p>
<p>The words caksur yasya na risyati mean that although we cannot see Him, this does not mean that He cannot see us.</p>
<p>Nor does He die when the cosmic manifestation is annihilated.</p>
<p>The example is given in this connection that the sunshine is present when the sun is present, but when the sun is not present, or when we cannot see the sun, this does not mean that the sun is lost.</p>
<p>The sun is there, but we cannot see it.</p>
<p>Similarly, although we cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in our present darkness, our lack of knowledge, He is always present, seeing our activities.</p>
<p>As the Paramatma, He is the witness and adviser (upadrasta and anumanta).</p>
<p>Therefore, by following the instructions of the spiritual master and studying authorized literatures, one can understand that God is present before us, seeing everything, although we have no eyes with which to see Him.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, He remains inactive in His spiritual energy and is untouched by the activities of the material energy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says in His Siksastaka, namnam akari bahudha nija-sarva-saktih: the Supreme Personality of Godhead has many names, which are all nondifferent from the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>This is spiritual existence.</p>
<p>By chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, consisting of names of the Supreme Lord, we find that the name has all the potencies of the person.</p>
<p>The Lord’s activities are many, and according to His activities He has many names.</p>
<p>He appeared as the son of mother Yasoda, and also as the son of mother Devaki, and therefore He is named Devaki-nandana and Yasoda-nandana.</p>
<p>Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate: the Lord has a multitude of energies, and therefore He acts in multifarious ways.</p>
<p>Yet He has a particular name.</p>
<p>The sastras recommend which names we should chant, such as Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>It is not that we have to search for some name or manufacture one.</p>
<p>Rather, we must follow the saintly persons and the sastras in chanting His holy name.</p>
<p>Although the material and spiritual energies both belong to the Lord, He is impossible to understand as long as we are in the material energy.</p>
<p>And when we come to the spiritual energy, He is very easy to know.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.7.23): mayam vyudasya cic-chaktya kaivalye sthita atmani.</p>
<p>Although the external energy belongs to the Lord, when one is in the external energy (mama maya duratyaya) He is very difficult to understand.</p>
<p>However, when one comes to the spiritual energy, one can understand Him.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (18.55) it is said, bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: one who wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in reality must take to the platform of bhakti, or Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>This bhakti consists of various activities (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam/ arcanam vandanam dasyam sakhyam atma-nivedanam (SB 7.5.23)), and to understand the Lord one must take to this path of devotional service.</p>
<p>Even though the people of the world have forgotten God and may say that God is dead, this is not a fact.</p>
<p>One can understand God when one takes to the Krsna consciousness movement, and thus one can be happy.</p>

<p>Therefore, to enable people to reach the stage of activities that are not tinged by fruitive results, great saints first engage people in fruitive activities, for unless one begins by performing activities as recommended in the sastras, one cannot reach the stage of liberation, or activities that produce no reactions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (3.9) Lord Krsna advises, yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world Generally, everyone is attracted to hard labor for becoming happy in this material world, but although various activities are going on all over the world simply for the sake of happiness, unfortunately only problems are being created from such fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Therefore it is advised that active persons engage in activities of Krsna consciousness, which are called yajna, because then they will gradually come to the platform of devotional service.</p>
<p>Yajna means Lord Visnu, the yajna-purusa, the enjoyer of all sacrifices (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram (Bg.5.29)).</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the enjoyer, and therefore if we begin our activities for His satisfaction, we will gradually lose our taste for material activities.</p>
<p>Suta Gosvami declared to the great assembly of sages at Naimisaranya:</p>
<p>atah pumbhir dvija-srestha</p>
<p>varnasrama-vibhagasah</p>
<p>svanusthitasya dharmasya</p>
<p>samsiddhir hari-tosanam</p>
<p>O best among the twice-born, it is concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties (dharma) according to caste divisions and order of life, is to please the Lord Hari (Bhag.1.2.13) According to Vedic principles, everyone must act according to his classification as brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha or sannyasi.</p>
<p>Everyone should progress toward perfection by acting in such a way that Krsna will be pleased (samsiddhir hari-tosanam (SB 1.2.13)).</p>
<p>One cannot please Krsna by sitting idly; one must act according to the directions of the spiritual master for the sake of pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then one will gradually come to the stage of pure devotional service.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.12):</p>
<p>naiskarmyam apy acyuta-bhava-varjitam</p>
<p>na sobhate jnanam alam niranjanam</p>
<p>Knowledge of self-realization, even though freed from all material affinity, does not look well if devoid of a conception of the infallible (God) Jnanis recommend that one adopt naiskarmya by not doing anything but simply meditating and thinking of Brahman, but this is impossible unless one realizes Parabrahman, Krsna.</p>
<p>If there is no Krsna consciousness, any kind of activity, be it philanthropic, political or social, simply causes karma-bandhana, bondage to material work.</p>
<p>As long as one is entangled in karma-bandhana, one must accept different types of bodies that spoil the human form of facility.</p>
<p>Therefore, in Bhagavad-gita (6.3) karma-yoga is recommended:</p>
<p>aruruksor muner yogam</p>
<p>karma karanam ucyate</p>
<p>yogarudhasya tasyaiva</p>
<p>samah karanam ucyate</p>
<p>For one who is a neophyte in the yoga system, work is said to be the means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material activities is said to be the means Nonetheless:</p>
<p>karmendriyani samyamya</p>
<p>ya aste manasa smaran</p>
<p>indriyarthan vimudhatma</p>
<p>mithyacarah sa ucyate</p>
<p>One who restrains the senses and organs of action, but whose mind dwells on sense objects, certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender (Bg.3.6) One should act for Krsna very seriously in order to become fully Krsna conscious and should not sit down to imitate such great personalities as Haridasa Thakura.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura condemned such imitation.</p>
<p>Me said:</p>
<p>dusta mana! tumi kisera vaisnava?</p>
<p>pratisthara tare, nirjanera ghare, tava hari-nama kevala kaitava</p>
<p>My dear mind, what kind of devotee are you? Simply for cheap adoration, you sit in a solitary place and pretend to chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, but this is all cheating Recently at Mayapur an African devotee wanted to imitate Haridasa Thakura, but after fifteen days he became restless and went away.</p>
<p>Do not suddenly try to imitate Haridasa Thakura.</p>
<p>Engage yourself in Krsna conscious activities, and gradually you will come to the stage of liberation (muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih).</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in opulence by His own gain, yet He acts as the creator, maintainer and annihilator of this material world.</p>
<p>In spite of acting in that way, He is never entangled.</p>
<p>Hence devotees who follow in His footsteps are also never entangled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world If we do not act in Krsna consciousness we shall be entangled, like silkworms in cocoons.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, appears in order to teach us how to work so that we will not be entangled in this material world.</p>
<p>Our real problem is that we are entangled in materialistic activities, and because we are conditioned, our struggle continues through punishment in material existence in one body after another in different forms of life.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):</p>
<p>mamaivamso jiva-loke</p>
<p>jiva-bhutah sanatanah</p>
<p>manah sasthanindriyani</p>
<p>prakrti-sthani karsati</p>
<p>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.</p>
<p>Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind The living entities are actually minute forms who are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is full in everything, and the small particles of the Lord are also originally qualified like Him, but because of their minute existence, they are infected by material attraction and thus entangled.</p>
<p>We must therefore follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and then, like Krsna, who is never entangled by His material activities of creation, maintenance and annihilation, we will have nothing for which to lament (navasidanti ye ’nu tam).</p>
<p>Krsna personally gives instructions in Bhagavad-gita, and anyone who follows these instructions is liberated.</p>
<p>Following Krsna’s instructions is possible when one is a devotee, for Krsna instructs that one should become a devotee.</p>
<p>Man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru: Always think of Me and become My devotee.</p>
<p>Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me (Bg.18.65) Always thinking of Krsna means chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, but unless one is an initiated devotee he cannot do this.</p>
<p>As soon as one becomes a devotee, he engages in Deity worship (mad-yaji).</p>
<p>A devotee’s business is to offer obeisances to the Lord and the spiritual master constantly.</p>
<p>This principle is the recognized way to come to the platform of bhakti.</p>
<p>As soon as one comes to this platform, he gradually understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and simply by understanding Krsna one is liberated from material bondage.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, works just like an ordinary human being, yet He does not desire to enjoy the fruits of work.</p>
<p>He is full in knowledge, free from material desires and diversions, and completely independent.</p>
<p>As the supreme teacher of human society, He teaches His own way of activities, and thus He inaugurates the real path of religion.</p>
<p>I request everyone to follow Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the sum and substance of our Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>We are simply requesting human society to follow in the footsteps of the teacher of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita As It Is, and your life will be successful.</p>
<p>That is the summary of the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>The organizer of the Krsna consciousness movement is teaching everyone how to follow Lord Ramacandra, how to follow Lord Krsna, and how to follow Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>In this material world, we need a leader for a monarchy or good government.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Ramacandra, by His practical example, showed how to live for the benefit of all human society.</p>
<p>He fought with demons like Ravana, He carried out the orders of His father, and He remained the faithful husband of mother Sita.</p>
<p>Thus there is no comparison to Lord Ramacandra’s acting as an ideal king.</p>
<p>Indeed, people still hanker for rama-rajya, a government conducted like that of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>Similarly, although Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He taught His disciple and devotee Arjuna how to lead a life ending in going back home, back to Godhead (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>All teachings—political, economic, social, religious, cultural and philosophical—are to be found in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One only has to follow them strictly.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead also comes as Lord Caitanya just to play the part of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord teaches us in different ways just to make our lives successful, and Svayambhuva Manu requests us to follow Him.</p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu is the leader of mankind, and he has given a book called Manu-samhita to guide human society.</p>
<p>Herein he directs us to follow the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different incarnations.</p>
<p>These incarnations are described in Vedic literature, and Jayadeva Gosvami has described ten important incarnations in summary (kesava dhrta-mina-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare, kesava dhrta-nara-hari-rupa jaya jagad-isa hare, kesava dhrta-buddha-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare, etc.).</p>
<p>Svayambhuva Manu instructs us to follow the instructions of God’s incarnations, especially Krsna’s instructions of Bhagavad-gita As It Is.</p>
<p>Appreciating bhakti-marga as instructed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya thus depicted the activities of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu:</p>
<p>vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yoga-</p>
<p>siksartham ekah purusah puranah</p>
<p>sri-krsna-caitanya-sarira-dhari</p>
<p>krpambudhir yas tam aham prapadye</p>
<p>(Cc.Madya 6.254)</p>
<p>Let me take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, who has descended in the form of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu to teach us real knowledge, His devotional service, and detachment from whatever does not foster Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>He has descended because He is an ocean of transcendental mercy.</p>
<p>Let me surrender unto His lotus feet (Caitanya-candrodaya-nataka6.74) In this age of Kali, people cannot follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore the Lord Himself takes the part of Sri Krsna Caitanya to teach personally how to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>He asks everyone to follow Him and to become a guru to deliver the fallen souls of Kali-yuga yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa</p>
<p>amara ajnaya guru hana tara’ ei desa</p>
<p>Instruct everyone to follow the orders of Lord Sri Krsna as they are given in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>In this way become a spiritual master and try to liberate everyone in this land (Cc.Madhya7.128) The coherent purpose of Lord Ramacandra, Lord Krsna and Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is to teach human society how to be happy by following the instructions of the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>In this regard, we understand that Lord Visnu sometimes becomes Brahma or Indra when there is no suitable person to occupy these posts.</p>

<p>The Second, Third and Fourth Chapters of this canto describe how the Lord, during the reign of the fourth Manu, gave protection to the king of the elephants.</p>
<p>As described in this Second Chapter, when the King of the elephants, along with his female elephants, was enjoying in the water, a crocodile suddenly attacked him, and the elephant surrendered to the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead for protection.</p>
<p>In the midst of the ocean of milk, there is a very high and beautiful mountain that has an altitude of ten thousand yojanas, or eighty thousand miles.</p>
<p>This mountain is known as Trikuta.</p>
<p>In a valley of Trikuta there is a nice garden named Rtumat, which was constructed by Varuna, and in that area there is a very nice lake.</p>
<p>Once the chief of the elephants, along with female elephants, went to enjoy bathing in that lake, and they disturbed the inhabitants of the water.</p>
<p>Because of this, the chief crocodile in that water, who was very powerful, immediately attacked the elephant’s leg.</p>
<p>Thus there ensued a great fight between the elephant and the crocodile.</p>
<p>This fight continued for one thousand years.</p>
<p>Neither the elephant nor the crocodile died, but since they were in the water, the elephant gradually became weak whereas the power of the crocodile increased more and more.</p>
<p>Thus the crocodile became more and more encouraged.</p>
<p>Then the elephant, being helpless and seeing that there was no other way for his protection, sought shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The ground at the foot of the mountain is always washed by waves of milk that produce emeralds all around in the eight directions (north, south, east, west and the directions midway between them).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From Srimad-Bhagavatam we understand that there are various oceans.</p>
<p>Somewhere there is an ocean filled with milk, somewhere an ocean of liquor, an ocean of ghee, an ocean of oil, and an ocean of sweet water.</p>
<p>Thus there are different varieties of oceans within this universe.</p>
<p>The modern scientists, who have only limited experience, cannot defy these statements; they cannot give us full information about any planet, even the planet on which we live.</p>
<p>From this verse, however, we can understand that if the valleys of some mountains are washed with milk, this produces emeralds.</p>
<p>No one has the ability to imitate the activities of material nature as conducted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>In the higher planetary systems, there are not only different types of human beings, but also animals like lions and elephants.</p>
<p>There are trees, and the land is made of emeralds.</p>
<p>Such is the creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung in this regard, kesava! tuya jagata vicitra: My Lord Kesava, Your creation is colorful and full of varieties Geologists, botanists and other so-called scientists speculate about other planetary systems, but being unable to estimate the varieties on other planets, they falsely imagine that all planets but this one are vacant, uninhabited, and full of dust.</p>
<p>Although they cannot even estimate the varieties existing throughout the universe, they are very proud of their knowledge, and they are accepted as learned by persons of a similar caliber.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.3.19), sva-vid-varahostra-kharaih samstutah purusah pasuh: materialistic leaders are praised by dogs, hogs, camels and asses, and they themselves are also big animals.</p>
<p>One should not be satisfied with the knowledge imparted by a big animal.</p>
<p>Rather, one must take knowledge from a perfect person like Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>

<p>Even in the material world, there are many grades of living entities.</p>
<p>The human beings on earth generally cover themselves with external fragrances to stop their bad bodily odors, but here we find that because of the bodily fragrance of the demigod damsels, the rivers, the lakes, the breeze and the entire atmosphere of Trikuta Mountain also become fragrant.</p>
<p>Since the bodies of the damsels in the upper planetary systems are so beautiful, we can just imagine how beautifully formed are the bodies of the Vaikuntha damsels or the damsels in Vrndavana, the gopis.</p>

<p>In that garden there was a very large lake filled with shining golden lotus flowers and the flowers known as kumuda, kahlara, utpala and satapatra, which added excellent beauty to the mountain.</p>
<p>There were also bilva, kapittha, jambira and bhallataka trees.</p>
<p>Intoxicated bumblebees drank honey and hummed with the chirping of the birds, whose songs were very melodious.</p>
<p>The lake was crowded with swans, karandavas, cakravakas, cranes, and flocks of water chickens, datyuhas, koyastis and other murmuring birds.</p>
<p>Because of the agitating movements of the fish and tortoises, the water was decorated with pollen that had fallen from the lotus flowers.</p>
<p>The lake was surrounded by kadamba flowers, vetasa flowers, nalas, nipas, vanjulakas, kundas, kurubakas, asokas, sirisas, kutajas, ingudas, kubjakas, svarna-yuthis, nagas, punnagas, jatis, mallikas, satapatras, jalakas and madhavi-latas.</p>
<p>The banks were also abundantly adorned with varieties of trees that yielded flowers and fruits in all seasons.</p>
<p>Thus the entire mountain stood gloriously decorated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Judging from the exhaustive description of the lakes and rivers on Trikuta Mountain, on earth there is no comparison to their super-excellence.</p>
<p>On other planets, however, there are many such wonders.</p>
<p>For instance, we understand that there are two million different types of trees, and not all of them are exhibited on earth.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam presents the total knowledge of the affairs of the universe.</p>
<p>It not only describes this universe, but also takes into account the spiritual world beyond the universe.</p>
<p>No one can challenge the Srimad-Bhagavatam’s descriptions of the material and spiritual worlds.</p>
<p>The attempts to go from the earth to the moon have failed, but the people of earth can understand what exists on other planets.</p>
<p>There is no need of imagination; one may take actual knowledge from Srimad-Bhagavatam and be satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, because of being pulled into the water and fighting for many long years, the elephant became diminished in his mental, physical and sensual strength.</p>
<p>The crocodile, on the contrary, being an animal of the water, increased in enthusiasm, physical strength and sensual power.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the fighting between the elephant and the crocodile, the difference was that although the elephant was extremely powerful, he was in a foreign place, in the water.</p>
<p>During one thousand years of fighting, he could not get any food, and under the circumstances his bodily strength diminished, and because his bodily strength diminished, his mind also became weak and his senses less powerful.</p>
<p>The crocodile, however, being an animal of the water, had no difficulties.</p>
<p>He was getting food and was therefore getting mental strength and sensual encouragement.</p>
<p>Thus while the elephant became reduced in strength, the crocodile became more and more powerful.</p>
<p>Now, from this we may take the lesson that in our fight with maya we should not be in a position in which our strength, enthusiasm and senses will be unable to fight vigorously.</p>
<p>Our Krsna consciousness movement has actually declared war against the illusory energy, in which all the living entities are rotting in a false understanding of civilization.</p>
<p>The soldiers in this Krsna consciousness movement must always possess physical strength, enthusiasm and sensual power.</p>
<p>To keep themselves fit, they must therefore place themselves in a normal condition of life.</p>
<p>What constitutes a normal condition will not be the same for everyone, and therefore there are divisions of varnasrama—brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.</p>
<p>Especially in this age, Kali-yuga, it is advised that no one take sannyasa asvamedham gavalambham</p>
<p>sannyasam pala-paitrkam</p>
<p>devarena sutotpattim</p>
<p>kalau panca vivarjayet</p>
<p>(Cc.Adi 17.164)</p>
<p>(Brahma-vaivarta Purana)</p>
<p>From this we can understand that in this age the sannyasa-asrama is forbidden because people are not strong.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed us an example in taking sannyasa at the age of twenty-four years, but even Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya advised Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to be extremely careful because He had taken sannyasa at an early age.</p>
<p>For preaching we give young boys sannyasa, but actually it is being experienced that they are not fit for sannyasa.</p>
<p>There is no harm, however, if one thinks that he is unfit for sannyasa; if he is very much agitated sexually, he should go to the asrama where sex is allowed, namely the grhastha-asrama.</p>
<p>That one has been found to be very weak in one place does not mean that he should stop fighting the crocodile of maya.</p>
<p>One should take shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna, as we shall see Gajendra do, and at the same time one can be a grhastha if he is satisfied with sexual indulgence.</p>
<p>There is no need to give up the fight.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore recommended, sthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhih.</p>
<p>One may stay in whichever asrama is suitable for him; it is not essential that one take sannyasa.</p>
<p>If one is sexually agitated, he can enter the grhastha-asrama.</p>
<p>But one must continue fighting.</p>
<p>For one who is not in a transcendental position, to take sannyasa artificially is not a very great credit.</p>
<p>If sannyasa is not suitable, one may enter the grhastha-asrama and fight maya with great strength.</p>
<p>But one should not give up the fighting and go away.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the King of the elephants saw that he was under the clutches of the crocodile by the will of providence and, being embodied and circumstantially helpless, could not save himself from danger, he was extremely afraid of being killed.</p>
<p>He consequently thought for a long time and finally reached the following decision.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Everyone in the material world is engaged in a struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Everyone tries to save himself from danger, but when one is unable to save himself, if he is pious, he then takes shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.16):</p>
<p>catur-vidha bhajante mam</p>
<p>janah sukrtino ’rjuna</p>
<p>arto jijnasur artharthi</p>
<p>jnani ca bharatarsabha</p>
<p>Four kinds of pious men—namely, one who is in danger, one who is in need of money, one who is searching for knowledge and one who is inquisitive—begin to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in order to be saved or to advance.</p>
<p>The King of the elephants, in his condition of danger, decided to seek shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>After considerable thought, he intelligently arrived at this correct decision.</p>
<p>Such a decision is not reached by a sinful man.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhagavad-gita it is said that those who are pious (sukrti) can decide that in a dangerous or awkward condition one should seek shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>

<p>The other elephants, who are my friends and relatives, could not rescue me from this danger.</p>
<p>What then to speak of my wives? They cannot do anything.</p>
<p>It is by the will of providence that I have been attacked by this crocodile, and therefore I shall seek shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always the shelter of everyone, even of great personalities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This material world is described as padam padam yad vipadam, which means that at every step there is danger.</p>
<p>A fool wrongly thinks that he is happy in this material world, but in fact he is not, for one who thinks that way is only illusioned.</p>
<p>At every step, at every moment, there is danger.</p>
<p>In modern civilization one thinks that if he has a nice home and a nice car his life is perfect.</p>
<p>In the Western countries, especially in America, it is very nice to possess a good car, but as soon as one is on the road, there is danger because at any moment an accident may take place and one will be killed.</p>
<p>The record actually shows that so many people die in such accidents.</p>
<p>Therefore if we actually think that this material world is a very happy place, this is our ignorance.</p>
<p>Real knowledge is that this material world is full of danger.</p>
<p>We may struggle for existence as far as our intelligence allows and may try to take care of ourselves, but unless the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, ultimately saves us from danger, our attempts will be useless.</p>
<p>Therefore Prahlada Maharaja says:</p>
<p>balasya neha saranam pitarau nrsimha</p>
<p>nartasya cagadam udanvati majjato nauh</p>
<p>taptasya tat-pratividhir ya ihanjasestas</p>
<p>tavad vibho tanu-bhrtam tvad-upeksitanam</p>
<p>(Bhag.7.9.19)</p>
<p>We may invent so many ways to be happy or to counteract the dangers of this material world, but unless our attempts are sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they will never make us happy.</p>
<p>Those who try to be happy without taking shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are mudhas, rascals.</p>
<p>Na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah (Bg.7.15).</p>
<p>Those who are the lowest of men refuse to take to Krsna consciousness because they think that they will be able to protect themselves without Krsna’s care.</p>
<p>This is their mistake.</p>
<p>The decision of the King of the elephants, Gajendra, was correct.</p>
<p>In such a dangerous position, he sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly not known to everyone, but He is very powerful and influential.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the serpent of eternal time, which is fearful in force, endlessly chases everyone, ready to swallow him, if one who fears this serpent seeks shelter of the Lord, the Lord gives him protection, for even death runs away in fear of the Lord.</p>
<p>I therefore surrender unto Him, the great and powerful supreme authority who is the actual shelter of everyone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is intelligent understands that there is a great and supreme authority above everything.</p>
<p>That great authority appears in different incarnations to save the innocent from disturbances.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: (Bg.4.8) the Lord appears in His various incarnations for two purposes—to annihilate the duskrti, the sinful, and to protect His devotees.</p>
<p>The King of the elephants decided to surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>This is intelligent.</p>
<p>One must know that great Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>The Lord comes personally to instruct us how to be happy, and only fools and rascals do not see by intelligence this supreme authority, the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>In the sruti-mantra it is said:</p>
<p>bhisasmad vatah pavate</p>
<p>bhisodeti suryah</p>
<p>bhisasmad agnis candras ca</p>
<p>mrtyur dhavati pancamah</p>
<p>(Taittiriya Upanisad2.8)</p>
<p>It is out of fear of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the wind is blowing, that the sun is distributing heat and light, and that death is chasing everyone.</p>
<p>Thus there is a supreme controller, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.10): mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram.</p>
<p>This material manifestation is working so well because of the supreme controller.</p>
<p>Any intelligent person, therefore, can understand that there is a supreme controller.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the supreme controller Himself appears as Lord Krsna, as Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and as Lord Ramacandra to give us instructions and to show us by example how to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Yet those who are duskrti, the lowest of men, do not surrender (na mam duskrtino mudhah prapadyante naradhamah (Bg.7.15)).</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord clearly says, mrtyuh sarva-haras caham: I am all-devouring death Thus mrtyu, or death, is the representative who takes everything away from the living entity who has accepted a material body.</p>
<p>No one can say, I do not fear death This is a false proposition.</p>
<p>Everyone fears death.</p>
<p>However, one who seeks shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be saved from death.</p>
<p>One may argue, Does the devotee not die The answer is that a devotee certainly must give up his body, for the body is material.</p>
<p>The difference is, however, that for one who surrenders to Krsna fully and who is protected by Krsna, the present body is his last; he will not again receive a material body to be subjected to death.</p>
<p>This is assured in Bhagavad-gita (4.9).</p>
<p>Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so’rjuna: a devotee, after giving up his body, does not accept a material body, but returns home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>We are always in danger because at any moment death can take place.</p>
<p>It is not that only Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was afraid of death.</p>
<p>Everyone should fear death because everyone is caught by the crocodile of eternal time and may die at any moment.</p>
<p>The best course, therefore, is to seek shelter of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and be saved from the struggle for existence in this material world, in which one repeatedly takes birth and dies.</p>
<p>To reach this understanding is the ultimate goal of life.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#gajendras-prayers-of-surrender" id="gajendras-prayers-of-surrender">Gajendra’s Prayers of Surrender</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#83" id="83">8.3</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter, the prayers by Gajendra, the King of the elephants, are described.</p>
<p>It appears that the King of the elephants was formerly a human being known as Indradyumna and that he learned a prayer to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Fortunately he remembered that prayer and began to chant it to himself.</p>
<p>First he offered his respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his awkward position in having been attacked by the crocodile, he expressed his inability to recite prayers nicely.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he tried to chant the mantra and expressed himself in appropriate words as follows The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, the original person from whom everything has emanated.</p>
<p>He is the root cause of this cosmic manifestation, and the entire cosmos rests in Him, yet He is transcendental, for He does everything in relation to the material world through His external energy.</p>
<p>He is eternally situated in the spiritual world—in Vaikuntha or Goloka Vrndavana—where He engages in His eternal pastimes.</p>
<p>The material world is a product of His external energy, or material nature, which works under His direction.</p>
<p>It is thus that creation, maintenance and annihilation take place.</p>
<p>The Lord exists at all times.</p>
<p>This is extremely difficult for a nondevotee to understand.</p>
<p>Although the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is perceivable by everyone, only the pure devotees perceive His presence and activities.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely free from material birth, death, old age and disease.</p>
<p>Indeed, if anyone in this material world takes shelter of Him, he also becomes situated in that transcendental position.</p>
<p>For the satisfaction of the devotee (paritranaya sadhunam), the Lord appears and exhibits His activities.</p>
<p>His appearance, disappearance and other pastimes are not at all material.</p>
<p>One who knows this secret can enter the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In the Lord, all opposing elements are adjusted.</p>
<p>The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>He is the controller of everything, He is the witness of all activities, and He is the original source of all living entities.</p>
<p>Indeed, all living entities are parts of Him, for He is the origin of Maha-Visnu, who is the source of the living entities within this material world.</p>
<p>The Lord can observe the activities of our senses, which can work and achieve material results because of His mercy.</p>
<p>Although He is the original source of everything, He is untouched by any of His by-products.</p>
<p>In this way He is like a gold mine, which is the source of gold in ornaments and yet is different from the ornaments themselves.</p>
<p>The Lord is worshiped by the method prescribed in the Pancaratras.</p>
<p>He is the source of our knowledge, and He can give us liberation.</p>
<p>Therefore it is our duty to understand Him according to the instructions of devotees, in particular the spiritual master.</p>
<p>Although for us the mode of goodness is covered, by following the instructions of saintly persons and the spiritual master we can be freed from material clutches The self-effulgent material form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is adored by nondevotees, His impersonal form is adored by those advanced in spiritual knowledge, and His feature as the localized Supersoul is appreciated by yogis.</p>
<p>But His original form as a person is understood only by devotees.</p>
<p>That Supreme Personality of Godhead is competent to dissipate the darkness of the conditioned soul through His instructions in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>He is the ocean of transcendental qualities and can be understood only by liberated persons freed from the bodily concept of life.</p>
<p>By His causeless mercy, the Lord can rescue the conditioned soul from the material clutches and enable him to return home, back to Godhead, to become His personal associate.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a pure devotee does not aspire to go back to Godhead; he is simply satisfied with executing his service in this material world.</p>
<p>A pure devotee does not ask anything from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>His only prayer is to be freed from the material conception of life and to be engaged in the Lord’s transcendental loving service In this way the King of the elephants, Gajendra, offered prayers directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without mistaking Him for one of the demigods.</p>
<p>None of the demigods came to see him, not even Brahma or Siva.</p>
<p>Rather, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, seated on Garuda, personally appeared before him.</p>
<p>Gajendra, by lifting his trunk, offered obeisances to the Lord, and the Lord immediately pulled him from the water along with the crocodile who had captured his leg.</p>
<p>Then the Lord killed the crocodile and thus rescued Gajendra.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thereafter, the King of the elephants, Gajendra, fixed his mind in his heart with perfect intelligence and chanted a mantra which he had learned in his previous birth as Indradyumna and which he remembered by the grace of Krsna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Such remembrance is described in Bhagavad-gita (6.43–44):</p>
<p>tatra tam buddhi-samyogam</p>
<p>labhate paurva-dehikam</p>
<p>yatate ca tato bhuyah</p>
<p>samsiddhau kuru-nandana</p>
<p>purvabhyasena tenaiva</p>
<p>hriyate hy avaso ’pi sah</p>
<p>In these verses it is assured that even if a person engaged in devotional service falls down, he is not degraded, but is placed in a position in which he will in due course of time remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As explained later, Gajendra was formerly King Indradyumna, and somehow or other in his next life he became King of the elephants.</p>
<p>Now Gajendra was in danger, and although he was in a body other than that of a human being, he remembered the stotra he had chanted in his previous life.</p>
<p>Yatate ca tato bhuyah samsiddhau kuru-nandana.</p>
<p>To enable one to achieve perfection, Krsna gives one the chance to remember Him again.</p>
<p>This is proved here, for although the King of the elephants, Gajendra, was put in danger, this was a chance for him to remember his previous devotional activities so that he could immediately be rescued by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is imperative, therefore, that all devotees in Krsna consciousness practice chanting some mantra.</p>
<p>Certainly one should chant the Hare Krsna mantra, which is the maha-mantra, or great mantra, and also one should practice chanting cintamani-prakara-sadmasu or the Nrsimha strotra (ito nrsimhah parato nrsimho yato yato yami tato nrsimhah).</p>
<p>Every devotee should practice in order to chant some mantra perfectly so that even though he may be imperfect in spiritual consciousness in this life, in his next life he will not forget Krsna consciousness, even if he becomes an animal.</p>
<p>Of course, a devotee should try to perfect his Krsna consciousness in this life, for simply by understanding Krsna and His instructions, after giving up this body one can return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Even if there is some falldown, practice of Krsna consciousness never goes in vain.</p>
<p>For example, Ajamila, in his boyhood, practiced chanting the name of Narayana under the direction of his father, but later, in his youth, he fell down and became a drunkard, woman-hunter, rogue and thief.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, because of chanting the name of Narayana for the purpose of calling his son, whom he had named Narayana, he became advanced, even though he was involved in sinful activities.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not forget the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra under any circumstances.</p>
<p>It will help us in the greatest danger, as we find in the life of Gajendra.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The King of the elephants, Gajendra, said: I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Person, Vasudeva (om namo bhagavate vasudevaya).</p>
<p>Because of Him this material body acts due to the presence of spirit, and He is therefore the root cause of everyone.</p>
<p>He is worshipable for such exalted persons as Brahma and Siva, and He has entered the heart of every living being.</p>
<p>Let me meditate upon Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the words etac cid-atmakam are very important.</p>
<p>The material body certainly consists only of material elements, but when one awakens to Krsna conscious understanding, the body is no longer material but spiritual.</p>
<p>The material body is meant for sense enjoyment, whereas the spiritual body engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, a devotee who engages in the service of the Supreme Lord and who constantly thinks of Him should never be considered to have a material body.</p>
<p>It is therefore enjoined, gurusu nara-matih: one should stop thinking of the spiritual master as an ordinary human being with a material body.</p>
<p>Arcye visnau sila-dhih: everyone knows that the Deity in the temple is made of stone, but to think that the Deity is merely stone is an offense.</p>
<p>Similarly, to think that the body of the spiritual master consists of material ingredients is offensive.</p>
<p>Atheists think that devotees foolishly worship a stone statue as God and an ordinary man as the guru.</p>
<p>The fact is, however, that by the grace of Krsna’s omnipotence, the so-called stone statue of the Deity is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the body of the spiritual master is directly spiritual.</p>
<p>A pure devotee who is engaged in unalloyed devotional service should be understood to be situated on the transcendental platform (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate (Bg.14.26)).</p>
<p>Let us therefore offer our obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whose mercy so-called material things also become spiritual when they are engaged in spiritual activity.</p>
<p>Omkara (pranava) is the symbolic sound representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Om tat sad iti nirdeso brahmanas tri-vidhah smrtah: the three words om tat sat immediately invoke the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says that He is omkara in all the Vedic mantras (pranavah sarva-vedesu).</p>
<p>The Vedic mantras are pronounced beginning with omkara to indicate immediately the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam, for example, begins with the words om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, and omkara (pranava).</p>
<p>We should be careful to understand that omkara does not indicate anything nirakara, or formless.</p>
<p>Indeed, this verse immediately says, om namo bhagavate.Bhagavan is a person.</p>
<p>Thus omkara is the representation of the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Omkara is not meant to be impersonal, as the Mayavadi philosophers consider it to be.</p>
<p>This is distinctly expressed here by the word purusaya.</p>
<p>The supreme truth addressed by omkara is purusa, the Supreme Person; He is not impersonal.</p>
<p>Unless He is a person, how can He control the great, stalwart controllers of this universe? Lord Visnu, Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are the supreme controllers of this universe, but Lord Visnu is offered obeisances even by Lord Siva and Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse uses the word paresaya, which indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by exalted demigods.</p>
<p>Paresaya means paramesvara.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are isvaras, great controllers, but Lord Visnu is paramesvara, the supreme controller.</p>

<p>The Supreme Godhead is the supreme platform on which everything rests, the ingredient by which everything has been produced, and the person who has created and is the only cause of this cosmic manifestation.</p>

<p>I surrender unto Him, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is self-sufficient in everything.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (9.4) the Lord says, maya tatam idam sarvam jagad avyakta-murtina: I am the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but everything rests upon My energy, just as an earthen pot rests on the earth The place where an earthen pot rests is also earth.</p>
<p>Then again, the earthen pot is manufactured by a potter, whose body is a product of earth.</p>
<p>The potter’s wheel with which the pot is made is an expansion of earth, and the ingredients from which the pot are made are also earth.</p>
<p>As confirmed in the sruti-mantra, yato va imani bhutani jayante yena jatani jivanti yat prayanty abhisamvisanti.</p>
<p>The original cause of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and after being annihilated, everything enters into Him (prakrtim yanti mamikam).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material birth, activities, name, form, qualities or faults.</p>
<p>To fulfill the purpose for which this material world is created and destroyed, He comes in the form of a human being like Lord Rama or Lord Krsna by His original internal potency.</p>
<p>He has immense potency, and in various forms, all free from material contamination, He acts wonderfully.</p>
<p>He is therefore the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>I offer my respects to Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Visnu Purana it is said, gunams ca dosams ca mune vyatita samasta-kalyana-gunatmako hi.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material form, qualities or faults.</p>
<p>He is spiritual and is the only reservoir of all spiritual qualities.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8) by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam.</p>
<p>The Lord’s activities of saving the devotees and annihilating the demons are transcendental.</p>
<p>Anyone annihilated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead gets the same result as a devotee who is protected by the Lord; both of them are transcendentally promoted.</p>
<p>The only difference is that a devotee goes directly to the spiritual planets and becomes an associate of the Supreme Lord, whereas demons are promoted to brahmaloka, the impersonal effulgence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Both of them, however, are transcendentally promoted.</p>
<p>The Lord’s killing or annihilating of the demons is not exactly like the killing of this material world.</p>
<p>Although He appears to act within the modes of material nature, He is nirguna, above the modes of nature.</p>
<p>His name is not material; otherwise how could one get liberation by chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Rama? The names of the Lord like Rama and Krsna are nondifferent from the person Rama and Krsna.</p>
<p>Thus by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra one constantly associates with Rama and Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore becomes liberated.</p>
<p>A practical example is Ajamila, who always remained transcendental to his activities simply by chanting the name Narayana.</p>
<p>If this was true of Ajamila, what is to be said of the Supreme Lord? When the Lord comes to this material world, He does not become a product of matter.</p>
<p>This is confirmed throughout Bhagavad-gita (janma-karma ca me divyam, avajananti mam mudhah manusim tanum asritam (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>Therefore, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead—Rama or Krsna—descends to act transcendentally for our benefit, we should not consider Him an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>When the Lord comes, He does so on the basis of His spiritual potency (sambhavamy atma-mayaya (Bg.4.6)).</p>
<p>Because He is not forced to come by the material energy, He is always transcendental.</p>
<p>One should not consider the Supreme Lord an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>Material names and forms are contaminated, but spiritual name and spiritual form are transcendental.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is realized by pure devotees who act in the transcendental existence of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>He is the bestower of uncontaminated happiness and is the master of the transcendental world.</p>
<p>Therefore I offer my respect unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood only by devotional service.</p>
<p>Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah (Bg.18.55).</p>
<p>If one wants to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth, one must take to the activities of devotional service.</p>
<p>These activities are called sattva or suddha-sattva.</p>
<p>In the material world, activities of goodness, which are symptomatic of a pure brahmana, are appreciated.</p>
<p>But the activities of devotional service are suddha-sattva; in other words, they are on the transcendental platform.</p>
<p>Only by devotional service can one understand the Supreme.</p>
<p>Devotional service is called naiskarmya.</p>
<p>Mere negation of material activity will not endure.</p>
<p>Naiskarmyam apy acyuta-bhava-varjitam.</p>
<p>Unless one performs activities with reference to Krsna consciousness, cessation of material activities will not be helpful.</p>
<p>In hopes of achieving naiskarmya, freedom from material action, many highly elevated sannyasis stopped their activities, yet they failed and returned to the material platform to act as materialistic persons.</p>
<p>But once one is engaged in the spiritual activities of bhakti-yoga, one does not fall down.</p>
<p>Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore an attempt to engage everyone always in spiritual activity, by which one becomes transcendental to material actions.</p>
<p>The spiritual activities of bhakti-marga—sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam (SB 7.5.23)—lead one to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Gopala-tapani Upanisad (15) says, bhaktir asya bhajanam tad ihamutropadhi-nairasyenaivamusmin manasah kalpanam etad eva ca naiskarmyam.</p>
<p>This is a definition of naiskarmya.</p>
<p>One acts in naiskarmya when he fully engages in Krsna conscious activities without material desires to enjoy, either here or in the upper planetary systems, in the present life or in a future life (iha-amutra).</p>
<p>Anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11).</p>
<p>When one is freed from all contamination and he acts in devotional service under the direction of the spiritual master, one is on the platform of naiskarma.</p>
<p>By such transcendental devotional service, the Lord is served.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Vasudeva, who is all-pervading, to the Lord’s fierce form as Lord Nrsimhadeva, to the Lord’s form as an animal (Lord Varahadeva), to Lord Dattatreya, who preached impersonalism, to Lord Buddha, and to all the other incarnations.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Lord, who has no material qualities but who accepts the three qualities goodness, passion and ignorance within this material world.</p>
<p>I also offer my respectful obeisances unto the impersonal Brahman effulgence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the previous verses it has been described that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material form, He accepts innumerable forms to favor His devotees and kill the demons.</p>
<p>As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, there are so many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that they are like the waves of a river.</p>
<p>The waves of a river flow incessantly, and no one can count how many waves there are.</p>
<p>Similarly, no one can calculate when and how the different incarnations of the Lord appear according to the necessities of time, place and candidates.</p>
<p>The Lord appears perpetually.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):</p>
<p>yada yada hi dharmasya</p>
<p>glanir bhavati bharata</p>
<p>abhyutthanam adharmasya</p>
<p>tadatmanam srjamy aham</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself In the material world there is always the possibility of deviation from Krsna consciousness, and therefore Krsna and His devotees always act in various forms to curb such godlessness.</p>
<p>Even impersonalists who stress the knowledge feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead want to merge in the effulgence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, here the word jnana-ghanaya indicates that for atheists who disbelieve in the form and existence of the Lord, all these various incarnations appear.</p>
<p>Since the Lord comes to teach in so many forms, no one can say that there is no God.</p>
<p>The word jnana-ghanaya is especially used here to refer to those whose knowledge has become solidified by dint of their searching for the Lord through speculative philosophical understanding.</p>
<p>Superficial knowledge is useless for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when one’s knowledge becomes extremely intense and deep, one understands Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah (Bg.7.19)).</p>
<p>A jnani attains this stage after many, many births.</p>
<p>Therefore the word jnana-ghanaya is used here.</p>
<p>The word santaya indicates that Lord Vasudeva is situated in everyone’s heart but does not act with the living entity.</p>
<p>Impersonalist jnanis realize Vasudeva when they are fully mature in knowledge (vasudevah samam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah).</p>

<p>ksetra-jnaya—unto the one who knows everything of the external body; namah—I offer my respectful obeisances; tubhyam—unto You; sarva—everything; adhyaksaya—who are superintending, managing; saksine—who are the witness, Paramatma, or antaryami; purusaya—the Supreme Person; atma-mulaya—who are the original source of everything; mula-prakrtaye—unto the purusa-avatara, the origin of prakrti and pradhana; namah—I offer my respectful obeisances.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the Supersoul, the superintendent of everything, and the witness of all that occurs.</p>
<p>You are the Supreme Person, the origin of material nature and of the total material energy.</p>
<p>You are also the owner of the material body.</p>
<p>Therefore, You are the supreme complete.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (13.3) the Lord says, ksetra jnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata: O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies Every one of us is thinking, I am this bod or This is my body but actually the truth is different.</p>
<p>Our bodies are given to us by the supreme proprietor.</p>
<p>The living entity, who is also ksetra jna, or the knower of the body, is not the body’s only proprietor; the actual proprietor of the body is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme ksetra jna.</p>
<p>For example, we may rent and occupy a house, but actually the owner of the house is the landlord.</p>
<p>Similarly, we may be allotted a certain type of body as a facility with which to enjoy this material world, but the actual proprietor of the body is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is called sarvadhyaksa because everything in the material world works under His supervision.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.10), wherein the Lord says, mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram: This material nature, working under My direction, O son of Kunti, is producing all moving and unmoving beings From prakrti, or material nature, come so many varieties of living entities, including aquatics, plants, trees, insects, birds, animals, human beings and demigods prakrti is the mother, and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the father (aham bija-pradah pita).</p>
<p>Prakrti can give us material bodies, but as spirit souls we are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.7): mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah.</p>
<p>The living entity, being part and parcel of God, is not a product of this material world.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is described in this verse as atma-mula, the original source of everything.</p>
<p>He is the seed of all existences (bijam mam sarva-bhutanam).</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (14.4) the Lord says:</p>
<p>sarva-yonisu kaunteya</p>
<p>murtayah sambhavanti yah</p>
<p>tasam brahma mahad yonir</p>
<p>aham bija-pradah pita</p>
<p>It should be understood that all living entities, in all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father Plants, trees, insects, aquatics, demigods, beasts, birds and all other living entities are sons or parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, but because they are struggling with different mentalities, they have been given different types of bodies (manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati (Bg.15.7)).</p>
<p>Thus they have become sons of prakrti, or material nature, which is impregnated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Every living entity in this material world is struggling for existence, and the only salvation or relief from the cycle of birth and death in the evolutionary process is full surrender.</p>
<p>This is indicated by the word namah, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You are the observer of all the objectives of the senses.</p>
<p>Without Your mercy, there is no possibility of solving the problem of doubts.</p>
<p>The material world is just like a shadow resembling You.</p>
<p>Indeed, one accepts this material world as real because it gives a glimpse of Your existence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To paraphrase this verse: The objectives of sensual activities are actually observed by You.</p>
<p>Without Your direction, the living entity cannot take even a step forward.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca.</p>
<p>You are situated in everyone’s heart, and only from You come remembrance and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Chayeva yasya bhuvanani bibharti durga (Bs.5.44).</p>
<p>The living entity under the clutches of maya wants to enjoy this material world, but unless You give him directions and remind him, he cannot make progress in pursuing his shadowy objective in life.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul wrongly progresses toward the wrong objective, life after life, and he is reminded of that objective by You.</p>
<p>In one life the conditioned soul desires to progress toward a certain objective, but after his body changes, he forgets everything.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my Lord, because he wanted to enjoy something of this world, You remind him of this in his next birth.</p>
<p>Mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca (Bg.15.15).</p>
<p>Because the conditioned soul wants to forget You, by Your grace You give him opportunities, life after life, by which he can almost perpetually forget You.</p>
<p>Therefore You are eternally the director of the conditioned souls.</p>
<p>It is because You are the original cause of everything that everything appears real.</p>
<p>The ultimate reality is Your Lordship, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto You The word sarva-pratyaya-hetave is explained by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, who says that a result gives one a glimpse of its cause.</p>
<p>For example, since an earthen pot is the result of the actions of a potter, by seeing the earthen pot one can guess at the existence of the potter.</p>
<p>Similarly, this material world resembles the spiritual world, and any intelligent person can guess how it is acting.</p>
<p>As explained in Bhagavad-gita, mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram (Bg.9.10).</p>
<p>The activities of the material world suggest that behind them is the superintendence of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You are the cause of all causes, but You Yourself have no cause.</p>
<p>Therefore You are the wonderful cause of everything.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the shelter of the Vedic knowledge contained in the sastras like the Pancaratras and Vedanta-sutra, which are Your representations, and who are the source of the parampara system.</p>
<p>Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists.</p>
<p>Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is described herein as the wonderful cause.</p>
<p>He is wonderful in the sense that although there may be unlimited emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (janmady asya yatah (Bhag.1.1.1)), He always remains complete (purnasya purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate).</p>
<p>In our experience in the material world, if we have a bank balance of one million dollars, as we withdraw money from the bank the balance gradually diminishes until it becomes nil.</p>
<p>However, the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is so complete that although innumerable Personalities of Godhead expand from Him, He remains the same Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Purnasya purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate.</p>
<p>Therefore He is the wonderful cause.</p>
<p>Govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami  isvarah paramah krsnah</p>
<p>sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah</p>
<p>anadir adir govindah</p>
<p>sarva-karana-karanam</p>
<p>Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller.</p>
<p>He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.</p>
<p>He is the origin of all.</p>
<p>He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes (Brahma-samhita 5.1) Even in this material world, we can understand that the sun has existed for millions of years and has given off heat and light since its creation, yet the sun still retains its power and never changes.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of the supreme cause, param brahma, Krsna? Everything emanates from Him perpetually, yet He maintains His original form (sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah).</p>
<p>Krsna personally says in Bhagavad-gita (10.8), mattah sarvam pravartate: Everything emanates from Me Everything emanates from Krsna eternally, yet He is the same Krsna and does not change.</p>
<p>Therefore He is the shelter of all transcendentalists who are eager to get free from material bondage.</p>
<p>Everyone must take shelter of Krsna.</p>
<p>It is therefore advised:</p>
<p>akamah sarva-kamo va</p>
<p>moksa-kama udara-dhih</p>
<p>tivrena bhakti-yogena</p>
<p>yajeta purusam param</p>
<p>Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service (Bhag.2.3.10) Param brahma, the Supreme Lord, and param dhama, the supreme repose, is Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore anyone who desires anything—whether he be a karmi, a jnani or a yogi—should try to perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead very seriously, and all of his desires will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham: (Bg.4.11) As the living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly Even the karmi who wants everything for his enjoyment can get it from Krsna.</p>
<p>For Krsna, supplying what he wants is not at all difficult.</p>
<p>Actually, however, one should worship Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the sake of getting liberation.</p>
<p>Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15).</p>
<p>By studying the Vedic literature, one should understand Krsna.</p>
<p>As confirmed here, sarvagamamnaya-maharnavaya.</p>
<p>He is the ocean, and all Vedic knowledge flows toward Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, intelligent transcendentalists take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja (Bg.18.66)).</p>
<p>This is the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>My Lord, as the fire in arani wood is covered, You and Your unlimited knowledge are covered by the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>Your mind, however, is not attentive to the activities of the modes of nature.</p>
<p>Those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge are not subject to the regulative principles directed in the Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>Because such advanced souls are transcendental, You personally appear in their pure minds.</p>
<p>Therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (10.11) it is said:</p>
<p>tesam evanukampartham</p>
<p>aham ajnana-jam tamah</p>
<p>nasayamy atma-bhava stho</p>
<p>jnana-dipena bhasvata</p>
<p>For a devotee who has taken the lotus feet of the Lord within his heart, the Lord gives spiritual enlightenment, known as jnana-dipa, by special mercy from within.</p>
<p>This jnana-dipa is compared to the fire hidden within arani wood.</p>
<p>To perform fire sacrifices, great sages previously did not ignite a fire directly; the fire would be invoked from arani wood.</p>
<p>Similarly, all living entities are covered by the modes of material nature, and the fire of knowledge can be ignited only by the Supreme Personality of Godhead when one takes Him within one’s heart.</p>
<p>Sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh.</p>
<p>If one takes seriously the lotus feet of Krsna, who is seated within one’s heart, the Lord eradicates all ignorance.</p>
<p>By the torch of knowledge, one immediately understands everything properly by the special mercy of the Supreme Lord and becomes self-realized.</p>
<p>In other words, although a devotee may externally not be very well educated, because of his devotional service the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives him enlightenment from within.</p>
<p>If the Lord gives enlightenment from within, how can one be in ignorance? Therefore the allegation of the Mayavadis that the devotional path is for the unintelligent or uneducated is untrue yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana</p>
<p>sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah</p>
<p>If one becomes an unalloyed devotee of the Supreme Lord, he automatically manifests all good qualities.</p>
<p>Such a devotee is above the instructions of the Vedas.</p>
<p>He is a paramahamsa.</p>
<p>Even without going through the Vedic literature, a devotee becomes pure and enlightened by the mercy of the Lord Therefore, my Lord the devotee says, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Since an animal such as I has surrendered unto You, who are supremely liberated, certainly You will release me from this dangerous position.</p>
<p>Indeed, being extremely merciful, You incessantly try to deliver me.</p>
<p>By your partial feature as Paramatma, You are situated in the hearts of all embodied beings.</p>
<p>You are celebrated as direct transcendental knowledge, and You are unlimited.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The words brhate namas te have been explained by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura: brhate sri-krsnaya.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Krsna.</p>
<p>There are many tattvas, such as visnu-tattva, jiva-tattva and sakti-tattva, but above everything is the visnu-tattva, which is all-pervading.</p>
<p>This all-pervading feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained in Bhagavad-gita (10.42), wherein the Lord says:</p>
<p>athava bahunaitena</p>
<p>kim jnatena tavarjuna</p>
<p>vistabhyaham idam krtsnam</p>
<p>ekamsena sthito jagat</p>
<p>But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe Thus Krsna says that the entire material world is maintained by His partial representation as Paramatma.</p>
<p>The Lord enters every universe as Garbhodakasayi Visnu and then expands Himself as Ksirodakasayi Visnu to enter the hearts of all living entities and even enter the atoms.</p>
<p>Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham.</p>
<p>Every universe is full of atoms, and the Lord is not only within the universe but also within the atoms.</p>
<p>Thus within every atom the Supreme Lord exists in His Visnu feature as Paramatma, but all the visnu-tattvas emanate from Krsna.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (10.2), aham adir hi devanam: Krsna is the adi, or beginning, of the devas of this material world—Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara.</p>
<p>Therefore He is described here as bhagavate brhate.</p>
<p>Everyone is bhagavan—everyone possesses opulence—but Krsna is brhan bhagavan, the possessor of unlimited opulence.</p>
<p>Isvarah paramah krsnah (Bs.5.1).</p>
<p>Krsna is the origin of everyone.</p>
<p>Aham sarvasya prabhavah.</p>
<p>Even Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara come from Krsna.</p>
<p>Mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: (Bg.7.7) there is no personality superior to Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that bhagavate brhate means unto Sri Krsna In this material world, everyone is a pasu, an animal, because of the bodily conception of life yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke</p>
<p>sva-dhih kalatradisu bhauma ijya-dhih</p>
<p>yat tirtha-buddhih salile na karhicij</p>
<p>janesv abhijnesu sa eva go-kharah</p>
<p>A human being who identifies the body made of three elements as the self, who considers the by-products of the body to be his kinsmen, who considers the land of his birth to be worshipable, and who goes to a place of pilgrimage simply to bathe rather than to meet men of transcendental knowledge there is to be considered like a cow or an ass (Bhag.10.84.13) Practically everyone, therefore, is a pasu, an animal, and everyone is attacked by the crocodile of material existence.</p>
<p>Not only the King of the elephants but every one of us is being attacked by the crocodile and is suffering the consequences.</p>
<p>Only Krsna can deliver us from this material existence.</p>
<p>Indeed, He is always trying to deliver us.</p>
<p>Isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati (Bg.18.61).</p>
<p>He is within our hearts and is not at all inattentive.</p>
<p>His only aim is to deliver us from material life.</p>
<p>It is not that He becomes attentive to us only when we offer prayers to Him.</p>
<p>Even before we offer our prayers, He incessantly tries to deliver us.</p>
<p>He is never lazy in regard to our deliverance.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse says, bhuri-karunaya namo ’layaya.</p>
<p>It is the causeless mercy of the Supreme Lord that He always tries to bring us back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>God is liberated, and He tries to make us liberated, but although He is constantly trying, we refuse to accept His instructions (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja (Bg.18.66)).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, He has not become angry.</p>
<p>Therefore He is described here as bhuri-karunaya, unlimitedly merciful in delivering us from this miserable material condition of life and taking us back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>Even such a devotee as Dhruva Maharaja wanted the material benediction of a kingdom greater than that of his father, and although he received a spiritual body, he also got the kingdom, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not disappoint anyone who takes shelter of His lotus feet.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Unalloyed devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Lord, worship Him in full surrender and always hear and chant about His activities, which are most wonderful and auspicious.</p>
<p>Thus they always merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>Such devotees never ask the Lord for any benediction.</p>
<p>I, however, am in danger.</p>
<p>Thus I pray to that Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally existing, who is invisible, who is the Lord of all great personalities, such as Brahma, and who is available only by transcendental bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Being extremely subtle, He is beyond the reach of my senses and transcendental to all external realization.</p>
<p>He is unlimited, He is the original cause, and He is completely full in everything.</p>
<p>I offer my obeisances unto Him.</p>

<p>One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation.</p>
<p>That is called pure devotional service Unalloyed devotees have nothing to ask from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Gajendra, the King of the elephants, was circumstantially asking for an immediate benediction because he had no other way to be rescued.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when there is no alternative, a pure devotee, being fully dependent on the mercy of the Supreme Lord, prays for some benediction.</p>
<p>But in such a prayer there is also regret.</p>
<p>One who always hears and chants about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is always situated on a platform on which he has nothing to ask in terms of material benefits.</p>
<p>Unless one is a completely pure devotee, one cannot enjoy the transcendental bliss derived from chanting and dancing in the ecstasy of the sankirtana movement.</p>
<p>Such ecstasy is not possible for an ordinary devotee.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed us how one can enjoy transcendental bliss simply by chanting, hearing and dancing in ecstasy.</p>
<p>This is bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Therefore the King of the elephants, Gajendra, said, adhyatmika-yoga-gamyam, indicating that unless one is situated on this transcendental platform, one cannot approach the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The benediction of being able to approach the Lord can be achieved after many, many births, yet Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has awarded this benediction to everyone, even to the fallen souls who have no heritage of anything in spiritual life.</p>
<p>That is actually being seen in the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>Therefore the path of bhakti-yoga is the spotless process by which to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah: only through devotional service can one approach the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1):</p>
<p>mayy asakta-manah partha</p>
<p>yogam yunjan mad-asrayah</p>
<p>asamsayam samagram mam</p>
<p>yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu</p>
<p>Now hear, O son of Prtha (Arjuna), how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt Simply by being attached to Krsna consciousness and by thinking of the lotus feet of Krsna constantly, one can fully understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without a doubt.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates His minor parts and parcels, the jiva-tattva, beginning with Lord Brahma, the demigods and the expansions of Vedic knowledge (Sama, Rg, Yajur and Atharva) and including all other living entities, moving and nonmoving, with their different names and characteristics.</p>
<p>As the sparks of a fire or the shining rays of the sun emanate from their source and merge into it again and again, the mind, the intelligence, the senses, the gross and subtle material bodies, and the continuous transformations of the different modes of nature all emanate from the Lord and again merge into Him.</p>
<p>He is neither demigod nor demon, neither human nor bird or beast.</p>
<p>He is not woman, man, or neuter, nor is He an animal.</p>
<p>He is not a material quality, a fruitive activity, a manifestation or nonmanifestation.</p>
<p>He is the last word in the discrimination of not this, not this and He is unlimited.</p>
<p>All glories to the Supreme Personality of Godhead!</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is a summary description of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s unlimited potency.</p>
<p>That supreme one is acting in different phases by manifesting His parts and parcels, which are all simultaneously differently situated by His different potencies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate).</p>
<p>Each and every potency is acting quite naturally (svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca).</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is unlimited.</p>
<p>Na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate: nothing is equal to Him, nor is anything greater than Him.</p>
<p>Although He manifests Himself in so many ways, personally He has nothing to do (na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate), for everything is done by expansions of His unlimited energies.</p>

<p>That covering is not destroyed by the influence of time.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this material world, every living entity is covered by the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedas enjoin that one should approach the Supreme Lord through the spiritual master, who is described and offered prayers in the Gautamiya-tantra as follows:</p>
<p>om ajnana-timirandhasya</p>
<p>jnananjana-salakaya</p>
<p>caksur unmilitam yena</p>
<p>tasmai sri-gurave namah</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who with the torchlight of knowledge has opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance Although one may struggle for existence in this material world, to live forever is impossible.</p>
<p>One must understand, however, that this struggle for existence is due to ignorance, for otherwise every living being is an eternal part of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>There is no need to live as an elephant or man, American or Indian; one should desire only to achieve liberation from the cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>Because of ignorance, we consider every life offered by nature to be happy and pleasing, but in the degraded life within this material world, from the life of Lord Brahma down to that of an ant, no one can actually be happy.</p>
<p>We are making so many plans to live happily, but there cannot be any happiness in this material world, however we may try to make a permanent settlement in this life or that.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes when bhakti-yoga, Krsna consciousness, is preached to the common man, people argue, Where is Krsna? Where is God? Can you show Him to us In this verse the answer is given that if we are sufficiently intelligent, we must know that there is someone who has created the entire cosmic manifestation, who has supplied and has become the ingredients for this cosmic manifestation, who is eternally existing, but who is not within the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>Simply on the basis of this suggestion, one can offer respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of devotional life.</p>

<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, the Supersoul, the master of all mystic yoga, who is seen in the core of the heart by perfect mystics when they are completely purified and freed from the reactions of fruitive activity by practicing bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The King of the elephants, Gajendra, simply accepted that there must be someone who has created this cosmic manifestation and has supplied its ingredients.</p>
<p>This should be admitted by everyone, even the most determined atheists.</p>
<p>Why, then, do the nondevotees and atheists not admit this? The reason is that they are polluted by the reactions of their fruitive activities.</p>
<p>One must be freed from all the dirt accumulated within the heart due to fruitive activities performed one after another.</p>
<p>One must wash off this dirt by practicing bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Yoga-randhita-karmanah.</p>
<p>As long as one is covered by material nature’s modes of ignorance and passion, there is no possibility of understanding the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Tada rajas-tamo-bhavah kama-lobhadayas ca ye (SB 1.2.19).</p>
<p>When one is freed from the modes of ignorance and passion, one becomes free from the lowest qualities—kama and lobha, lust and greed.</p>
<p>Nowadays there are so many yoga schools to encourage people in developing their lusty desires and greed through the practice of yoga.</p>
<p>People are therefore very much fond of so-called yoga practice.</p>
<p>The actual practice of yoga, however, is described here.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.13.1), dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah: a yogi is one who always meditates on the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.38):</p>
<p>premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena</p>
<p>santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti</p>
<p>yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Syamasundara, Krsna Himself, with inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love The bhakti-yogi constantly sees Syamasundara—beautiful Lord Krsna with His blackish bodily hue.</p>
<p>Because the King of the elephants, Gajendra, thought himself an ordinary animal, he thought himself unfit to see the Lord.</p>
<p>In his humility, he thought that he could not practice yoga.</p>
<p>In other words, how can those who are like animals in the bodily concept of life, and who have no purity of consciousness, practice yoga? In the present day, people who have no control over their senses, who have no understanding of philosophy and who do not follow religious principles or rules and regulations are nonetheless pretending to be yogis.</p>
<p>This is the greatest anomaly in the practice of mystic yoga.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whose illusory energy the jiva, who is part and parcel of God, forgets his real identity because of the bodily concept of life.</p>
<p>I take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose glories are difficult to understand.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, every living entity—regardless of whether he be human, demigod, animal, bird, bee or whatever—is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord and the living entity are intimately related like father and son.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of material contact, the living entity forgets this and wants to enjoy the material world independently, according to his own plan.</p>
<p>This illusion (maya) is very difficult to surmount.</p>
<p>Maya covers the living entity because of his willingness to forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead and make his own plan to enjoy this material world.</p>
<p>As long as this contamination continues, the conditioned soul will be unable to understand his real identity and will perpetually continue under illusion, life after life.</p>
<p>Ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair janasya moho ’yam aham mameti (Bhag.5.5.8).</p>
<p>As long as the living entity is not enlightened so that he may understand his real position, he will be attracted to materialistic life, to house, country or field, to society, sons, family, community, bank balance and so on.</p>
<p>Covered by all this, he will continue to think, I am this body, and everything related to this body is mine This materialistic conception of life is extremely difficult to surmount, but one who surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as did Gajendra, the King of the elephants, comes to enlightenment on the Brahman platform brahma-bhutah prasannatma</p>

<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam—in this way; gajendram—unto the King of the elephants, Gajendra; upavarnita—whose description; nirvisesam—not directed to any particular person (but to the Supreme, although he did not know who the Supreme is); brahma-adayah—the demigods, beginning with Brahma, Siva, Indra and Candra; vividha—varieties; linga-bhida—with separate forms; abhimanah—considering themselves separate authorities; na—not; ete—all of them; yada—when; upasasrpuh—approached; nikhila-atmakatvat—because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Supersoul of everyone; tatra—there; akhila—of the universe; amara-mayah—consisting of the demigods (who are only external parts of the body); harih—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can take away everything; avirasit—appeared (before the elephant).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: When the King of the elephants was describing the supreme authority, without mentioning any particular person, he did not invoke the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Indra and Candra.</p>
<p>Thus none of them approached him.</p>
<p>However, because Lord Hari is the Supersoul, Purusottama, the Personality of Godhead, He appeared before Gajendra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the description of Gajendra, he apparently was aiming at the supreme authority although he did not know who the supreme authority is.</p>
<p>He conjectured, There is a supreme authority who is above everything Under the circumstances, the Lord’s various expansions, such as Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Candra and Indra, all thought, Gajendra is not asking our help.</p>
<p>He is asking the help of the Supreme, who is above all of us As Gajendra has described, the Supreme Lord has various parts and parcels, including the demigods, human beings and animals, all covered by separate forms.</p>
<p>Although the demigods are in charge of maintaining different aspects of the universe, Gajendra thought that they were unable to rescue him.</p>
<p>Harim vina naiva mrtim taranti: no one can rescue anyone from the dangers of birth, death, old age and disease.</p>
<p>It is only the Supreme Personality of Godhead who can rescue one from the dangers of material existence.</p>
<p>Therefore an intelligent person, to get free from this dangerous existence, approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not any demigod.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah: those who are unintelligent approach the various demigods for temporary material benefits.</p>
<p>Actually, however, these demigods cannot rescue the living entity from the dangers of material existence.</p>
<p>Like other living entities, the demigods are merely external parts of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s transcendental body.</p>
<p>As stated in the Vedic mantras, sa atma-angany anya devatah.</p>
<p>Within the body is the atma, the soul, whereas the various parts of the body like the hands and legs are external.</p>
<p>Similarly, the atma of the entire cosmic manifestation is Narayana, Lord Visnu, and all the demigods, human beings and other living entities are parts of His body.</p>
<p>It may also be concluded that since a tree lives on the strength of its root and when the root is nourished with water all the parts of the tree are nourished, one should worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the original root of everything.</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very difficult to approach, He is very near to us because He lives within our hearts.</p>
<p>As soon as the Lord understands that one is seeking His favor by fully surrendering, naturally He immediately takes action.</p>
<p>Therefore although the demigods did not come to the aid of Gajendra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately appeared before him because of his fervent prayer.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the demigods were angry with Gajendra, for actually when Lord Visnu is worshiped, all the other demigods are also worshiped.</p>
<p>Yasmin tuste jagat tustam: if the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied, everyone is satisfied yatha taror mula-nisecanena</p>

<p>tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya</p>
<p>As pouring water on the root of a tree energizes the trunk, branches, twigs and everything else, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, so simply worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead through devotional service automatically satisfies the demigods, who are parts of that Supreme Personality (Bhag.4.31.14) When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped, all the demigods are satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After understanding the awkward condition of Gajendra, who had offered his prayers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, who lives everywhere, appeared with the demigods, who were offering prayers to Him.</p>
<p>Carrying His disc and other weapons, He appeared there on the back of His carrier, Garuda, with great speed, according to His desire.</p>
<p>Thus He appeared before Gajendra.</p>

<p>Since they considered Gajendra’s prayer to be directed toward the Lord, they felt offended, and this in itself was offensive.</p>
<p>Consequently, when the Lord went there, they also went and offered prayers to the Lord so that their offense might be excused.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Gajendra had been forcefully captured by the crocodile in the water and was feeling acute pain, but when he saw that Narayana, wielding His disc, was coming in the sky on the back of Garuda, he immediately took a lotus flower in his trunk, and with great difficulty due to his painful condition, he uttered the following words: O my Lord, Narayana, master of the universe, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The King of the elephants was so very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead that when he saw the Lord coming in the sky, with great pain and in a feeble voice he offered respect to the Lord.</p>
<p>A devotee does not consider a dangerous position to be dangerous, for in such a dangerous position he can fervently pray to the Lord in great ecstasy.</p>
<p>Thus a devotee regards danger as a good opportunity.</p>
<p>Tat te’nukampam susamiksamanah.</p>
<p>When a devotee is in great danger, he sees that danger to be the great mercy of the Lord because it is an opportunity to think of the Lord very sincerely and with undiverted attention.</p>
<p>Tat te ’nukampam susamiksamano bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam (Bhag.10.14.8).</p>
<p>He does not accuse the Supreme Personality of Godhead for having let His devotee fall into such a dangerous condition.</p>
<p>Rather, he considers that dangerous condition to be due to his past misdeeds and takes it as an opportunity to pray to the Lord and offer thanks for having been given such an opportunity.</p>
<p>When a devotee lives in this way, his salvation—his going back home, back to Godhead—is guaranteed.</p>
<p>We can see this to be true from the example of Gajendra, who anxiously prayed to the Lord and thus received an immediate chance to return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-2" id="summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#84" id="84">8.4</a></h3>
<p>This Fourth Chapter describes the previous birth of Gajendra and the crocodile.</p>
<p>It tells how the crocodile became a Gandharva and how Gajendra became an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>There was a king on the Gandharva planet whose name was Huhu.</p>
<p>Once this King Huhu was enjoying with women in the water, and while enjoying he pulled the leg of Devala Rsi, who was also taking a bath in the water.</p>
<p>Upon this, the sage became very angry and immediately cursed him to become a crocodile.</p>
<p>King Huhu was very sorry when cursed in that way, and he begged pardon from the sage, who in compassion gave him the benediction that he would be freed when Gajendra was delivered by the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus the crocodile was delivered when killed by Narayana.</p>
<p>When Gajendra, by the mercy of the Lord, became one of the Lord’s associates in Vaikuntha, he got four hands.</p>
<p>This achievement is called sarupya-mukti, or the liberation of receiving a spiritual body exactly like that of Narayana.</p>
<p>Gajendra, in his previous birth, had been a great devotee of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>His name was Indradyumna, and he was the King of the Tamila country.</p>
<p>Following the Vedic principles, this King retired from family life and constructed a small cottage in the Malayacala Hills, where he always worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead in silence.</p>
<p>Agastya Rsi, along with many disciples, once approached King Indradyumna’s asrama, but because the King was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he could not receive Agastya Rsi properly.</p>
<p>Thus the rsi became very angry and cursed the King to become a dull elephant.</p>
<p>In accordance with this curse, the King was born as an elephant, and he forgot all about his previous activities in devotional service.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in his birth as an elephant, when he was dangerously attacked by the crocodile, he remembered his past life in devotional service and remembered a prayer he had learned in that life.</p>
<p>Because of this prayer, he again received the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus he was immediately delivered, and he became one of the Lord’s four-handed associates.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by describing the good fortune of the elephant.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami says that by hearing the narration of Gajendra’s deliverance, one can also get the opportunity to be delivered.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami vividly describes this, and thus the chapter ends.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: When the Lord delivered Gajendra, King of the elephants, all the demigods, sages and Gandharvas, headed by Brahma and Siva, praised this activity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and showered flowers upon both the Lord and Gajendra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is evident from this chapter that great sages like Devala Rsi, Narada Muni and Agastya Muni will sometimes curse someone.</p>
<p>The curse of such a personality, however, is in fact a benediction.</p>
<p>Both the crocodile, who had been a Gandharva in his previous life, and Gajendra, who had been a king named Indradyumna, were cursed, but both of them benefited.</p>
<p>Indradyumna, in his birth as an elephant, attained salvation and became a personal associate of the Lord in Vaikuntha, and the crocodile regained his status as a Gandharva.</p>
<p>We find evidence in many places that the curse of a great saint or devotee is not a curse but a benediction.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The best of the Gandharvas, King Huhu, having been cursed by Devala Muni, had become a crocodile.</p>
<p>Now, having been delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he assumed a very beautiful form as a Gandharva.</p>
<p>Understanding by whose mercy this had happened, he immediately offered his respectful obeisances with his head and began chanting prayers just suitable for the transcendental Lord, the supreme eternal, who is worshiped by the choicest verses.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The story of how the Gandharva had become a crocodile will be described later.</p>
<p>The curse by which the Gandharva took this position was actually a blessing, not a curse.</p>
<p>One should not be displeased when a saintly person curses someone, for his curse, indirectly, is a blessing.</p>
<p>The Gandharva had the mentality of an inhabitant of the celestial planetary system, and for him to become an associate of the Supreme Lord would have taken millions of long years.</p>
<p>However, because he was cursed by Devala Rsi, he became a crocodile and in only one life was fortunate enough to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face and be promoted to the spiritual world to become one of the Lord’s associates.</p>
<p>Similarly, Gajendra was also delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead when he was freed from the curse of Agastya Muni.</p>

<p>gajendrah—the King of the elephants, Gajendra; bhagavat-sparsat—because of being touched by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vimuktah—was immediately freed; ajnana-bandhanat—from all kinds of ignorance, especially the bodily concept of life; praptah—achieved; bhagavatah—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; rupam—the same bodily features; pita-vasah—wearing yellow garments; catuh-bhujah—and four-handed, with conchshell, disc, club and lotus.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because Gajendra, King of the elephants, had been touched directly by the hands of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was immediately freed of all material ignorance and bondage.</p>
<p>Thus he received the salvation of sarupya-mukti, in which he achieved the same bodily features as the Lord, being dressed in yellow garments and possessing four hands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead by having his gross body touched by the Lord, his body turns into a spiritual body, and he can go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Gajendra assumed a spiritual body when his body was touched by the Lord.</p>
<p>Similarly, Dhruva Maharaja assumed his spiritual body in this way.</p>
<p>Arcana-paddhati, daily worship of the Deity, provides an opportunity to touch the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus it enables one to be fortunate enough to get a spiritual body and go back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Not only by touching the body of the Supreme Lord, but simply by hearing about His pastimes, chanting His glories, touching His feet and offering worship—in other words, by serving the Lord somehow or other—one is purified of material contamination.</p>
<p>This is the result of touching the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>One who is a pure devotee (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)), who acts according to the sastra and the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, certainly becomes purified.</p>
<p>Like Gajendra, he assumes a spiritual body and returns home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>Agastya Muni then spoke this curse against the King: This King Indradyumna is not at all gentle.</p>
<p>Being low and uneducated, he has insulted a brahmana.</p>
<p>May he therefore enter the region of darkness and receive the dull, dumb body of an elephant.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>An elephant is very strong, it has a very big body, and it can work very hard and eat a large quantity of food, but its intelligence is not at all commensurate with its size and strength.</p>
<p>Thus in spite of so much bodily strength, the elephant works as a menial servant for a human being.</p>
<p>Agastya Muni thought it wise to curse the King to become an elephant because the powerful King did not receive Agastya Muni as one is obliged to receive a brahmana.</p>
<p>Yet although Agastya Muni cursed Maharaja Indradyumna to become an elephant, the curse was indirectly a benediction, for by undergoing one life as an elephant, Indradyumna Maharaja ended the reactions for all the sins of his previous life.</p>
<p>Immediately after the expiry of the elephant’s life, he was promoted to Vaikunthaloka to become a personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, in a body exactly like that of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after Agastya Muni had thus cursed King Indradyumna, the Muni left that place along with his disciples.</p>
<p>Since the King was a devotee, he accepted Agastya Muni’s curse as welcome because it was the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, although in his next life he got the body of an elephant, because of devotional service he remembered how to worship and offer prayers to the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the unique position of a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Although the King was cursed, he welcomed the curse because a devotee is always aware that nothing can happen without the desire of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Although the King was not at fault, Agastya Muni cursed him, and when this happened the King considered it to be due to his past misdeeds.</p>
<p>Tat te ’nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag.10.14.8).</p>
<p>This is a practical example of how a devotee thinks.</p>
<p>He regards any reverses in life as blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of being agitated by such reverses, he continues his activities of devotional service, and Krsna takes care of him and enables him to be promoted to the spiritual world, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>If a devotee has to suffer the reactions of his past misdeeds, the Supreme Lord arranges for him to be given only a token of these reactions, and very soon he is freed from all the reactions of material contamination.</p>
<p>One should therefore adhere to devotional service, and the Lord Himself will very soon see to one’s promotion to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>A devotee should not be disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but must continue his regular program, depending on the Lord for everything.</p>
<p>The word upadharayan, considering is very significant in this verse.</p>
<p>This word indicates that a devotee knows what is what; he understands what is happening in material, conditional life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Upon delivering the King of the elephants from the clutches of the crocodile, and from material existence, which resembles a crocodile, the Lord awarded him the status of sarupya-mukti.</p>
<p>In the presence of the Gandharvas, the Siddhas and the other demigods, who were praising the Lord for His wonderful transcendental activities, the Lord, sitting on the back of His carrier, Garuda, returned to His all-wonderful abode and took Gajendra with Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the word vimoksya is significant.</p>
<p>For a devotee, moksa or mukti—salvation—means getting the position of the Lord’s associate.</p>
<p>The impersonalists are satisfied to get the liberation of merging in the Brahman effulgence, but for a devotee, mukti (liberation) means not to merge in the effulgence of the Lord, but to be directly promoted to the Vaikuntha planets and to become an associate of the Lord.</p>

<p>One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances unto You, is certainly a bona fide candidate for liberation A devotee who tolerates everything in this material world and patiently executes his devotional service can become mukti-pade sa daya-bhak, a bona fide candidate for liberation.</p>
<p>The word daya-bhak refers to a hereditary right to the Lord’s mercy.</p>
<p>A devotee must simply engage in devotional service, not caring about material situations.</p>
<p>Then he automatically becomes a rightful candidate for promotion to Vaikunthaloka.</p>
<p>The devotee who renders unalloyed service to the Lord gets the right to be promoted to Vaikunthaloka, just as a son inherits the property of his father.</p>
<p>When a devotee gets liberation, he becomes free from material contamination and engages as a servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.10.6): muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih.</p>
<p>The word svarupa refers to sarupya-mukti—going back home, back to Godhead, and remaining the Lord’s eternal associate, having regained a spiritual body exactly resembling that of the Lord, with four hands, holding the sankha, cakra, gada and padma.</p>
<p>The difference between the mukti of the impersonalist and that of the devotee is that the devotee is immediately appointed an eternal servant of the Lord, whereas the impersonalist, although merging in the effulgence of the brahmajyoti, is still insecure and therefore generally falls again to this material world.</p>
<p>Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho ’nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah (Bhag.10.2.32).</p>
<p>Although the impersonalist rises to the Brahman effulgence and enters into that effulgence, he has no engagement in the service of the Lord, and therefore he is again attracted to materialistic philanthropic activities.</p>
<p>Thus he comes down to open hospitals and educational institutions, feed poor men and perform similar materialistic activities, which the impersonalist thinks are more precious than serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Anadrta-yusmad-anghrayah.</p>
<p>The impersonalists do not think that the service of the Lord is more valuable than serving the poor man or starting a school or hospital.</p>
<p>Although they say brahma satyam jagan mithya—Brahman is real, and the material world is fals—they are nonetheless very eager to serve the false material world and neglect the service of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yatha—without deviation; anukirtayanti—they chant; etat—this narration of the deliverance of Gajendra; sreyah-kamah—persons who desire their own auspiciousness; dvi-jatayah—the twice-born (brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas); sucayah—especially the brahmanas, who are always clean; pratah—in the morning; utthaya—after getting up from sleep; duhsvapna-adi—beginning with sleeping badly at night; upasantaye—to counteract all troublesome positions.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, after getting up from bed in the morning, those who desire their own welfare—especially the brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and in particular the brahmana Vaisnavas—should chant this narration as it is, without deviation, to counteract the troubles of bad dreams.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Every verse in the Vedic literature, especially in the Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita, is a Vedic mantra.</p>
<p>Here the words yathanukirtayanti are used to recommend that this literature be presented as it is.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous persons, however, deviate from the actual narration and interpret the text in their own way with grammatical jugglery.</p>
<p>Such deviations are to be avoided.</p>
<p>This is a Vedic injunction supported by Sukadeva Gosvami, one of the mahajanas, or authorities.</p>
<p>He says, yathanukirtayanti: one should recite the mantra as it is, without deviation, for then one will be eligible to rise to the platform of all good fortune.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami especially recommends that those who are brahmanas (sucayah) recite all these mantras after rising from bed in the morning.</p>
<p>Because of sinful activities, at night we have bad dreams, which are very troublesome.</p>
<p>Indeed, Maharaja Yudhisthira was obliged to see hell because of a slight deviation from devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, duhsvapna—bad dreams—occur because of sinful activities.</p>
<p>A devotee sometimes accepts a sinful person as his disciple, and to counteract the sinful reactions he accepts from the disciple, he has to see a bad dream.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the spiritual master is so kind that in spite of having bad dreams due to the sinful disciple, he accepts this troublesome business for the deliverance of the victims of Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>After initiation, therefore, a disciple should be extremely careful not to commit again any sinful act that might cause difficulties for himself and the spiritual master.</p>
<p>Before the Deity, before the fire, before the spiritual master and before the Vaisnavas, the honest disciple promises to refrain from all sinful activity.</p>
<p>Therefore he must not again commit sinful acts and thus create a troublesome situation.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#85" id="85">8.5</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the fifth and sixth Manus, and it also describes the prayers of the demigods and the curse of Durvasa Muni.</p>
<p>The brother of Tamasa, the fourth Manu, who has previously been described, was the fifth Manu, Raivata.</p>
<p>The sons of Raivata included Arjuna, Bali and Vindhya.</p>
<p>During the reign of this Manu, Indra, the King of heaven, was known as Vibhu.</p>
<p>Among the demigods were the Bhutarayas, and among the seven rsis were Hiranyaroma, Vedasira and Urdhvabahu.</p>
<p>The rsi known as Subhra, by his wife, Vikuntha, gave birth to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vaikuntha.</p>
<p>This Supreme Personality of Godhead manifested a Vaikuntha planet at the request of Ramadevi.</p>
<p>His power and activities are mentioned in the Third Canto.</p>
<p>The sixth Manu was Caksusa, the son of Caksu Manu.</p>
<p>Among the sons of the sixth Manu were Puru, Purusa and Sudyumna.</p>
<p>During the reign of this Manu, Mantradruma was Indra, the King of the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Among the demigods were the Apyas, and among the seven rsis were Havisman and Viraka.</p>
<p>The wife of Vairaja, whose name was Devasambhuti, gave birth to Ajita, an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This Ajita, taking the shape of a tortoise and holding the mountain known as Mandara on His back, churned the ocean and produced nectar for the demigods.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit was very eager to hear about the churning of the ocean, and therefore Sukadeva Gosvami began to explain to him how the demigods, having been cursed by Durvasa Muni, were defeated in battle by the asuras.</p>
<p>When the demigods were deprived of their heavenly kingdom, they went to the assembly house of Lord Brahma and informed Lord Brahma of what had happened.</p>
<p>Then Brahma, along with all the demigods, went to the shore of the ocean of milk and offered prayers to Ksirodakasayi Visnu.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks here that this Vaikuntha planet, like Srimad-Bhagavatam, appears and is said to be born or created, but both Srimad-Bhagavatam and Vaikuntha eternally exist beyond the material universes, which are enveloped by eight kinds of coverings.</p>
<p>As described in the Second Canto, Lord Brahma saw Vaikuntha before the creation of the universe.</p>
<p>Viraraghava Acarya mentions that this Vaikuntha is within the universe.</p>
<p>It is situated above the mountain known as Lokaloka.</p>
<p>This planet is worshiped by everyone.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although the great activities and transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s various incarnations are wonderfully described, sometimes we are unable to understand them.</p>
<p>Yet everything is possible for Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>If one could count the atoms of the universe, then he could count the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But no one can count the atoms of the universe, nor can anyone count the transcendental qualities of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord’s glorious activities referred to in this connection took place after His personal bodyguards Jaya and Vijaya became Daityas, having been cursed by the great sages Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanat-kumara and Sanandana.</p>
<p>Jaya, as Hiranyaksa, had to fight with Varahadeva, and that same Varahadeva is mentioned in regard to the Raivata millennium.</p>
<p>The fighting, however, took place during the reign of the first Manu, Svayambhuva.</p>
<p>Therefore according to some authorities there are two Varahas.</p>
<p>According to others, however, Varaha appeared during the regime of Svayambhuva Manu and stayed in the water until that of Raivata Manu.</p>
<p>Some may doubt that this could be possible, but the answer is that everything is possible.</p>
<p>If one could count the atoms within the universe, one could count the qualities of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>But the atoms of the universe are impossible for anyone to count, and similarly no one can count the transcendental qualities of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: When the asuras, with their serpent weapons, severely attacked the demigods in a fight, many of the demigods fell and lost their lives.</p>
<p>Indeed, they could not be revived.</p>
<p>At that time, O King, the demigods had been cursed by Durvasa Muni, the three worlds were poverty-stricken, and therefore ritualistic ceremonies could not be performed.</p>
<p>The effects of this were very serious.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is described that while Durvasa Muni was passing on the road, he saw Indra on the back of his elephant and was pleased to offer Indra a garland from his own neck.</p>
<p>Indra, however, being too puffed up, took the garland, and without respect for Durvasa Muni, he placed it on the trunk of his carrier elephant.</p>
<p>The elephant, being an animal, could not understand the value of the garland, and thus the elephant threw the garland between its legs and smashed it.</p>
<p>Seeing this insulting behavior, Durvasa Muni immediately cursed Indra to be poverty-stricken, bereft of all material opulence.</p>
<p>Thus the demigods, afflicted on one side by the fighting demons and on the other by the curse of Durvasa Muni, lost all the material opulences in the three worlds.</p>
<p>To be extremely opulent in materialistic advancement is sometimes very risky.</p>
<p>The materially opulent person does not care about anyone, and thus he commits offenses to great personalities, such as devotees and great saints.</p>
<p>This is the way of material opulence.</p>
<p>As described by Sukadeva Gosvami, dhana-durmadandha: too much wealth makes one blind.</p>
<p>This happens even to Indra in his heavenly kingdom, and what to speak of others in this material world? When one is materially opulent, he should learn to be sober and well-behaved toward Vaisnavas and saintly persons; otherwise he will fall down.</p>

<p>Upon seeing that the demigods were bereft of all influence and strength and that the three worlds were consequently devoid of auspiciousness, and upon seeing that the demigods were in an awkward position whereas all the demons were flourishing, Lord Brahma, who is above all the demigods and who is most powerful, concentrated his mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus being encouraged, he became bright-faced and spoke to the demigods as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After hearing from the demigods the real situation, Lord Brahma was very much concerned because the demons were unnecessarily so powerful.</p>
<p>When demons become powerful, the entire world is placed in an awkward position because demons are simply interested in their own sense gratification and not in the welfare of the world.</p>
<p>Demigods or devotees, however, are concerned with the welfare of all living beings.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami, for example, left his ministership and went to Vrndavana for the benefit of the entire world (lokanam hita-karinau).</p>
<p>This is the nature of a saintly person or demigod.</p>
<p>Even impersonalists think of the welfare of all people.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse explains that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equal to everyone.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):</p>
<p>samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu</p>
<p>na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah</p>
<p>ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya</p>

<p>I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone.</p>
<p>I am equal to all.</p>
<p>But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him Although the Lord is impartial, He gives special attention to His devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):</p>
<p>paritranaya sadhunam</p>
<p>vinasaya ca duskrtam</p>
<p>dharma-samsthapanarthaya</p>
<p>sambhavami yuge yuge</p>
<p>To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium The Lord has nothing to do with anyone’s protection or destruction, but for the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this material world He apparently has to act either in goodness, in passion or in darkness.</p>
<p>Actually, however, He is unaffected by these modes of material nature.</p>
<p>He is the Supreme Lord of everyone.</p>
<p>As a king sometimes punishes or rewards someone to maintain law and order, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although having nothing to do with the activities of this material world, sometimes appears as various incarnations according to the time, place and object.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Now is the time to invoke the mode of goodness of the living entities who have accepted material bodies.</p>
<p>The mode of goodness is meant to establish the Supreme Lord’s rule, which will maintain the existence of the creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, this is the opportune moment to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Because He is naturally very kind and dear to the demigods, He will certainly bestow good fortune upon us.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material world is conducted by the three modes of nature, namely sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.</p>
<p>By rajo-guna everything material is created, by sattva-guna everything material is maintained properly, and by tamo-guna, when the creation is improperly situated, everything is destroyed.</p>
<p>From this verse we can understand the situation of Kali-yuga, through which we are now passing.</p>
<p>Just before the beginning of Kali-yuga—or, in other words, at the end of Dvapara-yuga—Lord Sri Krsna appeared and left His instructions in the form of Bhagavad-gita, in which He asked all living entities to surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of Kali-yuga, however, people have practically been unable to surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna, and therefore, after some five thousand years, Krsna came again as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu just to teach the entire world how to surrender unto Him, unto Sri Krsna, and thus be purified.</p>
<p>Surrendering unto the lotus feet of Krsna means achieving complete purification.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):</p>
<p>sarva-dharman parityajya</p>
<p>mam ekam saranam vraja</p>
<p>aham tvam sarva-papebhyo</p>
<p>moksayisyami ma sucah</p>
<p>Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.</p>
<p>I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>Do not fear Thus as soon as one surrenders unto the lotus feet of Krsna, one certainly becomes free from all contamination.</p>
<p>Kali-yuga is full of contamination.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.3.51):</p>
<p>kaler dosa-nidhe rajann</p>
<p>asti hy eko mahan gunah</p>
<p>kirtanad eva krsnasya</p>
<p>mukta-sangah param vrajet</p>
<p>This age of Kali is full of unlimited faults.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is just like an ocean of faults (dosa-nidhi).</p>
<p>But there is one chance, one opportunity.</p>
<p>Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet: simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, one can be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga and, in his original spiritual body, can return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the opportunity of Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>When Krsna appeared, He gave His orders, and when Krsna Himself appeared as a devotee, as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, He showed us the path by which to cross the ocean of Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>That is the path of the Hare Krsna movement.</p>
<p>When Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu appeared, He ushered in the era for the sankirtana movement.</p>
<p>It is also said that for ten thousand years this era will continue.</p>
<p>This means that simply by accepting the sankirtana movement and chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, the fallen souls of this Kali-yuga will be delivered.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Kuruksetra, at which Bhagavad-gita was spoken, Kali-yuga continues for 432,000 years, of which only 5,000 years have passed.</p>
<p>Thus there is still a balance of 427,000 years to come.</p>
<p>Of these 427,000 years, the 10,000 years of the sankirtana movement inaugurated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu 500 years ago provide the opportunity for the fallen souls of Kali-yuga to take to the Krsna consciousness movement, chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra and thus be delivered from the clutches of material existence and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is potent always, but it is especially potent in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami, while instructing Maharaja Pariksit, stressed this chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra kaler dosa-nidhe rajann</p>
<p>asti hy eko mahan gunah</p>
<p>kirtanad eva krsnasya</p>
<p>mukta-sangah param vrajet</p>
<p>My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age.</p>
<p>It is that simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom (Bhag.12.3.51) Those who have accepted the task of spreading the Hare Krsna maha-mantra in full Krsna consciousness should take this opportunity to deliver people very easily from the clutches of material existence.</p>
<p>Our duty, therefore, is to follow the instructions of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and preach the Krsna consciousness movement all over the world very sincerely.</p>
<p>This is the best welfare activity for the peace and prosperity of human society.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement consists of spreading krsna-sankirtana.</p>
<p>Param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam: All glories to the Sri Krsna sankirtana Why is it so glorious? This has also been explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Ceto-darpana-marjanam: (Cc.Antya 20.12) by the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one’s heart is cleansed.</p>
<p>The whole difficulty is that in this age of Kali there is no sattva-guna and no clearance of the heart, and therefore people are making the mistake of identifying with their bodies.</p>
<p>Even the big philosophers and scientists with whom we deal are practically all under the impression that they are their bodies.</p>
<p>The other day we were discussing a prominent philosopher, Thomas Huxley, who was proud of being an Englishman.</p>
<p>This means that he was in the bodily conception of life.</p>
<p>Everywhere we find this same misunderstanding.</p>
<p>As soon as one is in the bodily conception of life, one is nothing but an animal like a cat or a dog (sa eva go-kharah (SB 10.84.13)).</p>
<p>Thus the most dangerous of the dirty things within our hearts is this misidentification of the body as the self.</p>
<p>Under the influence of this misunderstanding, one thinks, I am this body.</p>
<p>I am an Englishman.</p>
<p>I am an Indian.</p>
<p>I am an American.</p>
<p>I am Hindu.</p>
<p>I am Muslim This misconception is the strongest impediment, and it must be removed.</p>
<p>That is the instruction of Bhagavad-gita and of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Indeed, Bhagavad-gita begins with this instruction:</p>
<p>dehino ’smin yatha dehe</p>
<p>kaumaram yauvanam jara</p>
<p>tatha dehantara-praptir</p>
<p>dhiras tatra na muhyati</p>
<p>As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change (Bg.2.13) Although the soul is within the body, nevertheless, because of misunderstanding and animal propensities one accepts the body as the self.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says, ceto-darpana-marjanam (Cc.Antya 20.12).</p>
<p>To cleanse the core of the heart, which is full of misunderstanding, is possible only through sri-krsna-sankirtana.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Krsna consciousness movement should very seriously take this opportunity to be kind to the fallen souls by delivering them from the misunderstanding of materialistic life.</p>
<p>One cannot be happy in any way within this material world.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.16):</p>
<p>abrahma-bhuvanal lokah</p>
<p>punar avartino ’rjuna</p>
<p>From the highest planet in this material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place Therefore, not to speak of going to the moon, even if one is promoted to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, there cannot be any happiness in this material world.</p>
<p>If one actually wants happiness, one must go to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>The material world is characterized by a struggle for existence, and survival of the fittest is a well-known principle, but the poor souls of this material world do not know what is survival and who is fit.</p>
<p>Survival does not mean that one should die; survival means that one should not die, but should enjoy an everlastingly blissful life of knowledge.</p>
<p>This is survival.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is meant to make every person fit for survival.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is meant to stop the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>The Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita give definite directions on how to stop the struggle for existence and how to survive in eternal life.</p>
<p>The sankirtana movement, therefore, is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>Simply by hearing Bhagavad-gita and chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one becomes completely purified.</p>
<p>Thus the struggle for existence ceases, and one goes back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>He was not at all angry with the muni’s son who had cursed him.</p>
<p>Rather, he accepted the curse and prepared for his death in the association of Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>Death is inevitable; no one can surpass the force of death.</p>
<p>Therefore Maharaja Pariksit, while fully alive, wanted to hear Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>He is consequently addressed here as arindama.</p>
<p>Another word, sura-priya, is also significant.</p>
<p>Although Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is equal toward everyone, He is especially inclined toward His devotees (ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya mayi te tesu capy aham).</p>
<p>The devotees are all demigods.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of men within this world.</p>
<p>One is called the deva, and the other is called the asura.</p>
<p>The Padma Purana states:</p>
<p>dvau bhuta-sargau loke ’smin</p>
<p>daiva asura eva ca</p>
<p>visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva</p>
<p>asuras tad-viparyayah</p>
<p>Anyone who is a devotee of Lord Krsna is called a deva, and others, even though they may be devotees of demigods, are called asuras.</p>
<p>Ravana, for example, was a great devotee of Lord Siva, but he is described as an asura.</p>
<p>Similarly, Hiranyakasipu is described as a great devotee of Lord Brahma, yet he was also an asura.</p>
<p>Therefore, only the devotee of Lord Visnu is called sura, not asura.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna is very much pleased with His devotees, even if they are not on the topmost stage of devotional service.</p>
<p>Even on the lower stages of devotional service one is transcendental, and if one continues with devotional life, he continues to be a deva or sura.</p>
<p>If one continues in this way, Krsna will always be pleased with him and will give him all instructions so that he may very easily return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Concerning ajitasya padam, the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the milk ocean of this material world, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says: padam ksirodadhi-stha-svetadvipam tamasah prakrteh param.</p>
<p>The island known as Svetadvipa, which is in the ocean of milk, is transcendental.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with this material world.</p>
<p>A city government may have a rest house where the governor and important government officers stay.</p>
<p>Such a rest house is not an ordinary house.</p>
<p>Similarly, although Svetadvipa, which is in the ocean of milk, is in this material world, it is param padam, transcendental.</p>

<p>sruta-purvaya vai prabhuh</p>
<p>stutim abruta daivibhir</p>
<p>girbhis tv avahitendriyah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tatra—there (at the Lord’s abode known as Svetadvipa); adrsta-svarupaya—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was not seen even by Lord Brahma; sruta-purvaya—but who was heard about from the Vedas; vai—indeed; prabhuh—Lord Brahma; stutim—prayers derived from Vedic literature; abruta—performed; daivibhih—by prayers mentioned in the Vedic literature or offered by persons strictly following Vedic principles; girbhih—by such sound vibrations or songs; tu—then; avahita-indriyah—fixed in mind, without deviation.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There (at Svetadvipa), Lord Brahma offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though he had never seen the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Simply because Lord Brahma had heard about the Supreme Personality of Godhead from Vedic literature, with a fixed mind he offered the Lord prayers as written or approved by Vedic literature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that when Brahma and the other demigods go to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Svetadvipa, they cannot directly see Him, but their prayers are heard by the Lord, and the needful action is taken.</p>
<p>This we have seen in many instances.</p>
<p>The word sruta-purvaya is significant.</p>
<p>We get experience by directly seeing or by hearing.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to see someone directly, we can hear about him from authentic sources.</p>
<p>Sometimes people ask whether we can show them God.</p>
<p>This is ludicrous.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for one to see God before he can accept God.</p>
<p>Our sensory perception is always incomplete.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if we see God, we may not be able to understand Him.</p>
<p>When Krsna was on earth, many, many people saw Him but could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam (Bg.9.11).</p>
<p>Even though the rascals and fools saw Krsna personally, they could not understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Even upon seeing God personally, one who is unfortunate cannot understand Him.</p>
<p>Therefore we have to hear about God, Krsna, from the authentic Vedic literature and from persons who understand the Vedic version properly.</p>
<p>Even though Brahma had not seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead before, he was confident that the Lord was there in Svetadvipa.</p>
<p>Thus he took the opportunity to go there and offer prayers to the Lord.</p>
<p>These prayers were not ordinary concocted prayers.</p>
<p>Prayers must be approved by Vedic literature, as indicated in this verse by the words daivibhir girbhih.</p>
<p>In our Krsna consciousness movement we do not allow any song that has not been approved or sung by bona fide devotees.</p>
<p>We cannot allow cinema songs to be sung in the temple.</p>
<p>We generally sing two songs.</p>
<p>One is sri-krsna-caitanya prabhu nityananda sri-advaita gadadhara srivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrnda.</p>
<p>This is bona fide.</p>
<p>It is always mentioned in the Caitanya-caritamrta, and it is accepted by the acaryas.</p>
<p>The other, of course, is the maha-mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>We may also sing the songs of Narottama dasa Thakura, Bhaktivinoda Thakura and Locana dasa Thakura, but these two songs—sri-krsna-caitany and the Hare Krsna maha-mantra—are sufficient to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we cannot see Him.</p>
<p>Seeing the Lord is not as important as appreciating Him from the authentic literature or the authentic statements of authorized persons.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-brahma uvaca—Lord Brahma said; avikriyam—unto the Personality of Godhead, who never changes (as opposed to material existence); satyam—the eternal supreme truth; anantam—unlimited; adyam—the original cause of all causes; guha-sayam—present in everyone’s heart; niskalam—without any decrease in potency; apratarkyam—inconceivable, not within the jurisdiction of material arguments; manah-agrayanam—more quick than the mind, inconceivable to mental speculation; vacasa—by jugglery of words; aniruktam—indescribable; namamahe—all of us demigods offer our respectful obeisances; deva-varam—unto the Supreme Lord, who is not equalled or surpassed by anyone; varenyam—the supreme worshipable, who is worshiped by the Gayatri mantra.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma said: O Supreme Lord, O changeless, unlimited supreme truth.</p>
<p>You are the origin of everything.</p>
<p>Being all-pervading, You are in everyone’s heart and also in the atom.</p>
<p>You have no material qualities.</p>
<p>Indeed, You are inconceivable.</p>
<p>The mind cannot catch You by speculation, and words fail to describe You.</p>
<p>You are the supreme master of everyone, and therefore You are worshipable for everyone.</p>
<p>We offer our respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not anything of material creation.</p>
<p>Everything material must change from one form to another—for example, from earth to earthen pot and from earthen pot to earth again.</p>
<p>All our creations are temporary, impermanent.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is eternal, and similarly the living entities, who are parts of Him, are also eternal (mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah (Bg.15.7)).</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sanatana, eternal, and the individual living entities are also eternal.</p>
<p>The difference is that Krsna, or God, is the supreme eternal, whereas the individual souls are minute, fragmental eternals.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.3), ksetrajnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata.</p>
<p>Although the Lord is a living being and the individual souls are living beings, the Supreme Lord, unlike the individual souls, is vibhu, all-pervading, and ananta, unlimited.</p>
<p>The Lord is the cause of everything.</p>
<p>The living entities are innumerable, but the Lord is one.</p>
<p>No one is greater than Him, and no one is equal to Him.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord is the supreme worshipable object, as understood from the Vedic mantras (na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate).</p>
<p>The Lord is supreme because no one can evaluate Him by mental speculation or jugglery of words.</p>
<p>The Lord can travel more quickly than the mind.</p>
<p>In the sruti-mantras of Isopanisad it is said:</p>
<p>anejad ekam manaso javiyo</p>
<p>nainad deva apnuvan purvam arsat</p>
<p>tad dhavato ’nyan atyeti tisthat</p>
<p>tasminn apo matarisva dadhati</p>
<p>Although fixed in His abode, the Personality of Godhead is swifter than the mind and can overcome all others running.</p>
<p>The powerful demigods cannot approach Him.</p>
<p>Although in one place, He controls those who supply the air and rain.</p>
<p>He surpasses all in excellence (Isopanisad4) Thus the Supreme is never to be equaled by the subordinate living entities.</p>
<p>Because the Lord is situated in everyone’s heart and the individual living entity is not, never should the individual living entity be equated with the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (15.15) the Lord says, sarvasya caham hrdi sannivistah: I am situated in everyone’s heart This does not mean, however, that everyone is equal to the Lord.</p>
<p>In the sruti-mantras it is also said, hrdi hy ayam atma pratisthitah.</p>
<p>In the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is said, satyam param dhimahi.</p>
<p>The Vedic mantras say, satyam jnanam anantam and niskalam niskriyam santam niravadyam.</p>
<p>God is supreme.</p>
<p>Although naturally He does not do anything, He is doing everything.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita:</p>
<p>maya tatam idam sarvam</p>
<p>jagad avyakta-murtina</p>
<p>mat-sthani sarva-bhutani</p>
<p>na caham tesv avasthitah</p>
<p>By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.</p>
<p>All beings are in Me, but I am not in them (Bg.9.4)</p>
<p>mayadhyaksena prakrtih</p>
<p>suyate sacaracaram</p>
<p>hetunanena kaunteya</p>
<p>jagad viparivartate</p>
<p>This material nature, working under My direction, O son of Kunti, is producing all moving and unmoving beings.</p>
<p>By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again (Bg.9.10) Thus although the Lord is silent in His abode, He is doing everything through His different energies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate).</p>
<p>All the Vedic mantras, or sruti-mantras, are included in this verse spoken by Lord Brahma, for Brahma and his followers, the Brahma-sampradaya, understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the parampara system.</p>
<p>We have to gain understanding through the words of our predecessors.</p>
<p>There are twelve mahajanas, or authorities, of whom Brahma is one svayambhur naradah sambhuh</p>
<p>kumarah kapilo manuh</p>
<p>prahlado janako bhismo</p>
<p>balir vaiyasakir vayam</p>
<p>(Bhag.6.3.20)</p>
<p>We belong to the disciplic succession of Brahma, and therefore we are known as the Brahma-sampradaya.</p>
<p>As the demigods follow Lord Brahma to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we also have to follow the authorities of the parampara system to understand the Lord.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead directly and indirectly knows how everything, including the living force, mind and intelligence, is working under His control.</p>
<p>He is the illuminator of everything and has no ignorance.</p>
<p>He does not have a material body subject to the reactions of previous activities, and He is free from the ignorance of partiality and materialistic education.</p>
<p>I therefore take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, who is eternal, all-pervading and as great as the sky and who appears with six opulences in three yugas (Satya, Treta and Dvapara).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described in this way: janmady asya yato’nvayad itaratas carthesv abhijnah (Bhag.1.1.1).</p>
<p>The Lord is the origin of all emanations, and He directly and indirectly knows everything about all the activities within His creation.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is addressed here as vipascitam, one who is full of all knowledge or who knows everything.</p>
<p>The Lord is the Supreme Soul, and He knows everything about the living entities and their senses.</p>
<p>The word anidram, meaning always awake and free from ignorance is very important in this verse.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: it is the Lord who gives intelligence to everyone and who causes everyone to forget.</p>
<p>There are millions and millions of living entities, and the Lord gives them directions.</p>
<p>Therefore He has no time to sleep, and He is never in ignorance of our activities.</p>
<p>The Lord is the witness of everything; He sees what we are doing at every moment.</p>
<p>The Lord is not covered by a body resulting from karma.</p>
<p>Our bodies are formed as a result of our past deeds (karmana daiva-netrena), but the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not have a material body, and therefore He has no avidya, ignorance.</p>
<p>He does not sleep, but is always alert and awake.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is described as tri-yuga because although He appeared variously in Satya-yuga, Treta-yuga and Dvapara-yuga, when He appeared in Kali-yuga He never declared Himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam</p>
<p>sangopangastra-parsadam</p>
<p>The Lord appears in Kali-yuga as a devotee.</p>
<p>Thus although He is Krsna, He chants the Hare Krsna mantra like a devotee.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.32) recommends:</p>
<p>yajnaih sankirtana-prayair</p>
<p>yajanti hi sumedhasah</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, whose complexion is not black like that of Krsna but is golden (tvisakrsnam), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He is accompanied by associates like Nityananda, Advaita, Gadadhara and Srivasa.</p>
<p>Those who are sufficiently intelligent worship this Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing sankirtana-yajna.</p>
<p>In this incarnation, the Supreme Lord declares Himself not to be the Supreme Lord, and therefore He is known as Tri-yuga.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the cycle of material activities, the material body resembles the wheel of a mental chariot.</p>
<p>The ten senses (five for working and five for gathering knowledge) and the five life airs within the body form the fifteen spokes of the chariot’s wheel.</p>
<p>The three modes of nature (goodness, passion and ignorance) are its center of activities, and the eight ingredients of nature (earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego) comprise the rim of the wheel.</p>
<p>The external, material energy moves this wheel like electrical energy.</p>
<p>Thus the wheel revolves very quickly around its hub or central support, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul and the ultimate truth.</p>

<p>The central point is the Supersoul.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in pure goodness (suddha-sattva), and therefore He is eka-varna—the omkara (pranava).</p>
<p>Because the Lord is beyond the cosmic manifestation, which is considered to be darkness, He is not visible to material eyes.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, He is not separated from us by time or space, but is present everywhere.</p>

<p>Sattvam visuddham vasudeva-sabditam (Bhag.4.3.23).</p>
<p>In this material world, the three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—prevail.</p>
<p>Among these three, goodness is the platform of knowledge, and passion brings about a mixture of knowledge and ignorance, but the mode of ignorance is full of darkness.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is beyond darkness and passion.</p>
<p>He is on the platform where goodness or knowledge is not disturbed by passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>This is called the vasudeva platform.</p>
<p>It is on this platform of vasudeva that Vasudeva, or Krsna, can appear.</p>
<p>Thus Krsna appeared on this planet as the son of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Because the Lord is situated beyond the three modes of material nature, He is unseen by those who are dominated by these three modes.</p>
<p>One must therefore become dhira, or undisturbed by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The process of yoga may be practiced by one who is free from the agitation of these modes.</p>
<p>Therefore yoga is defined in this way: yoga indriya-samyamah.</p>
<p>As previously explained, we are disturbed by the indriyas, or senses.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are agitated by the three modes of material nature, which are imposed upon us by the external energy.</p>
<p>In conditional life, the living entity moves turbulently in the whirlpool of birth and death, but when one is situated on the transcendental platform of visuddha-sattva, pure goodness, he can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sits on the back of Garuda.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>No one can overcome the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s illusory energy (maya), which is so strong that it bewilders everyone, making one lose the sense to understand the aim of life.</p>
<p>That same maya, however, is subdued by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who rules everyone and who is equally disposed toward all living entities.</p>
<p>Let us offer our obeisances unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The prowess of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, certainly controls all living entities, so much so that the living entities have forgotten the aim of life.</p>
<p>Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: (SB 7.5.31) the living entities have forgotten that the aim of life is to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives all conditioned souls what appears to be an opportunity to be happy within this material world, but that is maya; in other words, it is a dream that is never to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thus every living being is illusioned by the external energy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>That illusory energy is undoubtedly very strong, but she is fully under the control of the transcendental person who is described in this verse as paresam, the transcendental Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is not a part of the material creation, but is beyond the creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, not only does He control the conditioned souls through His external energy, but He also controls the external energy itself.Bhagavad-gita clearly says that the strong material energy controls everyone and that getting out of her control is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>That controlling energy belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and works under His control.</p>
<p>The living entities, however, being subdued by the material energy, have forgotten the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>At the time of death, their attempts to use their so-called scientific knowledge and philosophical speculation to deny the supremacy of the Lord cannot work.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu, for example, was an exalted representative of the atheistic class of men.</p>
<p>He always challenged the existence of God, and thus he became inimical even toward his own son.</p>
<p>Everyone was afraid of Hiranyakasipu’s atheistic principles.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when Lord Nrsimhadeva appeared in order to kill him, Hiranyakasipu’s atheistic principles could not save him.</p>
<p>Lord Nrsimhadeva killed Hiranyakasipu and took away all his power, influence and pride.</p>
<p>Atheistic men, however, never understand how everything they create is annihilated.</p>
<p>The Supersoul is situated within them, but because of the predominance of the modes of passion and ignorance, they cannot understand the supremacy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Even the demigods, the devotees, who are transcendentally situated or situated on the platform of goodness, are not fully aware of the qualities and position of the Lord.</p>
<p>How then can the demons and atheists understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead? It is not possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, to gain this understanding, the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma, offered their respectful obeisances to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>On this earth there are four kinds of living entities, who are all created by Him.</p>
<p>The material creation rests on His lotus feet.</p>
<p>He is the great Supreme Person, full of opulence and power.</p>
<p>May He be pleased with us.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word mahi refers to the five material elements—earth, water, air, fire and sky—which rest upon the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Mahat-padam punya-yaso murareh.</p>
<p>The mahat-tattva, the total material energy, rests on His lotus feet, for the cosmic manifestation is but another opulence of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this cosmic manifestation there are four kinds of living entities—jarayu ja (those born from embryos), anda ja (those born from eggs), sveda ja (those born from perspiration), and udbhijja (those born from seeds).</p>
<p>Everything is generated from the Lord, as confirmed in the Vedanta-sutra (janmady asya yatah (Bhag.1.1.1)).</p>
<p>No one is independent, but the Supreme Soul is completely independent.</p>
<p>Janmady asya yato ’nvayad itaratas carthesv abhijnah sva-rat (Bhag.1.1.1).</p>
<p>The word sva-rat means independent We are dependent, whereas the Supreme Lord is completely independent.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Lord is the greatest of all.</p>
<p>Even Lord Brahma, who created the cosmic manifestation, is but another opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The material creation is activated by the Lord, and therefore the Lord is not a part of the material creation.</p>
<p>The Lord exists in His original, spiritual position.</p>
<p>The universal form of the Lord, vairaja-murti, is another feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Despite the theories of so-called scientists, the vast quantities of water on this planet and on other planets are not created by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.</p>
<p>Rather, the water is sometimes explained to be the perspiration and sometimes the semen of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is from water that all living entities emerge, and because of water they live and grow.</p>
<p>If there were no water, all life would cease.</p>
<p>Water is the source of life for everyone.</p>

<p>All learned men say that the five elements, eternal time, fruitive activity, the three modes of material nature, and the varieties produced by these modes are all creations of yogamaya.</p>
<p>This material world is therefore extremely difficult to understand, but those who are highly learned have rejected it.</p>
<p>May the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the controller of everything, be pleased with us.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word durvibhavyam is very important in this verse.</p>
<p>No one can understand how everything is happening in this material world by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead through His material energies.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.10), mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram: everything is actually happening under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This much we can learn, but how it is happening is extremely difficult to understand.</p>
<p>We cannot even understand how the affairs within our body are systematically taking place.</p>
<p>The body is a small universe, and since we cannot understand how things are happening in this small universe, how can we understand the affairs of the bigger universe? Actually this universe is very difficult to understand, yet learned sages have advised, as Krsna has also advised, that this material world is duhkhalayam asasvatam; (Bg.8.15) in other words, it is a place of misery and temporality.</p>
<p>One must give up this world and go back home, back to the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Materialists may argue, If this material world and its affairs are impossible to understand, how can we reject it The answer is provided by the word prabudhapabadham.</p>
<p>We have to reject this material world because it is rejected by those who are learned in Vedic wisdom.</p>
<p>Even though we cannot understand what this material world is, we should be ready to reject it in accordance with the advice of learned persons, especially the advice of Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna says:</p>
<p>mam upetya punar janma</p>
<p>duhkhalayam asasvatam</p>
<p>napnuvanti mahatmanah</p>
<p>samsiddhim paramam gatah</p>
<p>After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection (Bg.8.15) One has to return home, back to Godhead, for this is the highest perfection of life.</p>
<p>To go back to Godhead means to reject this material world.</p>
<p>Although we cannot understand the functions of this material world and whether it is good for us or bad for us, in accordance with the advice of the supreme authority we must reject it and go back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself Thus it is not imagination but a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His sweet will, appears in different incarnations, such as Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Nrsimha, Vamana, Parasurama, Ramacandra, Balarama, Buddha and many other forms.</p>
<p>Devotees are always eager to see one of the Lord’s innumerable forms.</p>
<p>It is said that just as no one can count how many waves there are in the sea, no one can count the forms of the Lord.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that anyone can claim to be a form of the Lord and be acceptable as an incarnation.</p>
<p>The incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead must be accepted in terms of the descriptions found in the sastras.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma is eager to see the incarnation of the Lord, or the original source of all incarnations; he is not eager to see an imposter.</p>
<p>The incarnation’s activities are proof of His identity.</p>
<p>All the incarnations described in the sastras act wonderfully (kesava dhrta-mina-sarira jaya jagadisa hare).</p>
<p>It is only by the personal sweet will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that He appears and disappears, and only fortunate devotees can expect to see Him face to face.</p>

<p>Karmis are always anxious to accumulate wealth for their sense gratification, but for that purpose they must work very hard.</p>
<p>Yet even though they work hard, the results are not satisfying.</p>
<p>Indeed, sometimes their work results only in frustration.</p>
<p>But devotees who have dedicated their lives to the service of the Lord can achieve substantial results without working very hard.</p>
<p>These results exceed the devotee’s expectations.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>We can practically see how the devotees who have dedicated their lives for the service of the Lord in the Krsna consciousness movement are getting immense opportunities for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead without working very hard.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement actually started with only forty rupees, but now it has more than forty crores worth of property, and all this opulence has been achieved within eight or ten years.</p>
<p>No karmi can expect to improve his business so swiftly, and besides that, whatever a karmi acquires is temporary and sometimes frustrating.</p>
<p>In Krsna consciousness, however, everything is encouraging and improving.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is not very popular with the karmis because this movement recommends that one refrain from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication.</p>
<p>These are restrictions that karmis very much dislike.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in the presence of so many enemies, this movement is progressing, going forward without impediments.</p>
<p>If the devotees continue to spread this movement, dedicating life and soul to the lotus feet of Krsna, no one will be able to check it.</p>
<p>The movement will go forward without limits.</p>
<p>Chant Hare Krsna!</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Activities dedicated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even if performed in small measure, never go in vain.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being the supreme father, is naturally very dear and always ready to act for the good of the living entities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.40), the Lord says svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: this dharma, devotional service, is so important that even if performed to a very small, almost negligible extent, it can give one the supreme result.</p>
<p>There are many instances in the history of the world in which even a slight service rendered to the Lord has saved a living entity from the greatest danger.</p>
<p>Ajamila, for example, was saved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the greatest danger, that of going to hell.</p>
<p>He was saved simply because he chanted the name Narayana at the end of his life.</p>
<p>When Ajamila chanted this holy name of the Lord, Narayana, he did not chant knowingly; actually he was calling his youngest son, whose name was Narayana.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Lord Narayana took this chanting seriously, and thus Ajamila achieved the result of ante narayana-smrtih, remembering Narayana at the end of life.</p>
<p>If one somehow or other remembers the holy name of Narayana, Krsna or Rama at the end of life, he immediately achieves the transcendental result of going back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the only object of our love.</p>
<p>As long as we are in this material world we have so many desires to fulfill, but when we come in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we immediately become perfect and fully satisfied, just as a child is fully satisfied when he comes to the lap of his mother.</p>
<p>Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest to achieve some material result by austerity and penance, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead he said, I do not want any material benediction.</p>
<p>I am completely satisfied Even if one wants some material benefit from serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this can be achieved extremely easily, without hard labor.</p>
<p>Therefore the sastra recommends:</p>
<p>akamah sarva-kamo va</p>
<p>moksa-kama udara-dhih</p>
<p>tivrena bhakti-yogena</p>
<p>yajeta purusam param</p>
<p>Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service (Bhag.2.3.10) Even if one has material desires, one can undoubtedly achieve what he wants by rendering service to the Lord.</p>

<p>As stated in the Padma Purana:</p>
<p>aradhananam sarvesam</p>
<p>visnor aradhanam param</p>
<p>tasmat parataram devi</p>
<p>tadiyanam samarcanam</p>
<p>Of all types of worship, worship of Lord Visnu is best, and better than the worship of Lord Visnu is the worship of His devotee, the Vaisnava There are many demigods worshiped by people who are attached to material desires (kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante’nya-devatah (Bg.7.20)).</p>
<p>Because people are embarrassed by so many material desires, they worship Lord Siva, Lord Brahma, the goddess Kali, Durga, Ganesa and Surya to achieve different results.</p>
<p>However, one can achieve all these results simultaneously just by worshiping Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>As stated elsewhere in the Bhagavatam (4.31.14):</p>

<p>trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah</p>

<p>Similarly, by worshiping Lord Visnu one can satisfy everyone Krsna consciousness is not a sectarian religious movement.</p>
<p>Rather, it is meant for all-embracing welfare activities for the world.</p>
<p>One can enter this movement without discrimination in terms of caste, creed, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>If one is trained to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the origin of visnu-tattva, one can become fully satisfied and perfect in all respects.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, all obeisances unto You, who are eternal, beyond time’s limits of past, present and future.</p>
<p>You are inconceivable in Your activities, You are the master of the three modes of material nature, and, being transcendental to all material qualities, You are free from material contamination.</p>
<p>You are the controller of all three of the modes of nature, but at the present You are in favor of the quality of goodness.</p>
<p>Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the material activities manifested by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, nirgunam guna-bhoktr ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always transcendental to the material qualities (sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna), but nonetheless He is their controller.</p>
<p>The Lord manifests Himself in three features—as Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara—to control these three qualities.</p>
<p>He personally takes charge of sattva-guna as Lord Visnu, and He entrusts the charge of rajo-guna and tamo-guna to Lord Brahma and Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, He is the controller of all three gunas.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma, expressing his appreciation, said that because Lord Visnu had now taken charge of the activities of goodness, there was every hope that the demigods would be successful in fulfilling their desires.</p>
<p>The demigods were harassed by the demons, who were infested with tamo-guna.</p>
<p>However, as Lord Brahma has previously described, since the time of sattva-guna had now arrived, the demigods could naturally expect to fulfill their desires.</p>
<p>The demigods are supposedly well advanced in knowledge, yet they could not understand the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is addressed here as anantaya.</p>
<p>Although Lord Brahma knows past, present and future, he is unable to understand the unlimited knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-demigods-and-demons-declare-a-truce" id="the-demigods-and-demons-declare-a-truce">The Demigods and Demons Declare a Truce</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-4" id="summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#86" id="86">8.6</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how the Lord appeared before the demigods when they offered Him their prayers.</p>
<p>Following the advice of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods executed a truce with the demons for the purpose of churning nectar from the sea.</p>
<p>Because of the prayers offered by the demigods in the previous chapter, Lord Ksirodakasayi Visnu was pleased with the demigods, and thus He appeared before them.</p>
<p>The demigods were almost blinded by His transcendental bodily effulgence.</p>
<p>At first, therefore, they could not even see any part of His body.</p>
<p>After some time, however, when Brahma could see the Lord, he, along with Lord Siva, began to offer the Lord prayers.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being beyond birth and death, is eternal.</p>
<p>He has no material qualities.</p>
<p>Yet He is the ocean of unlimited auspicious qualities.</p>
<p>He is subtler than the most subtle, He is invisible, and His form is inconceivable.</p>
<p>He is worshipable for all the demigods.</p>
<p>Innumerable universes exist within His form, and therefore He is never separated from these universes by time, space or circumstances.</p>
<p>He is the chief and the pradhana.</p>
<p>Although He is the beginning, the middle and the end of the material creation, the idea of pantheism conceived by Mayavadi philosophers has no validity.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead controls the entire material manifestation through His subordinate agent, the external energy.</p>
<p>Because of His inconceivable transcendental position, He is always the master of the material energy.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His various forms, is always present even within this material world, but the material qualities cannot touch Him.</p>
<p>One can understand His position only by His instructions, as given in Bhagavad-gita As stated in Bhagavad-gita (10.10), dadami buddhi-yogam tam.</p>
<p>Buddhi-yoga means bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Only through the process of bhakti-yoga can one understand the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When offered prayers by Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased.</p>
<p>Thus He gave appropriate instructions to all the demigods.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is known as Ajita, unconquerable, advised the demigods to make a peace proposal to the demons, so that after formulating a truce, the demigods and demons could churn the ocean of milk.</p>
<p>The rope would be the biggest serpent, known as Vasuki, and the churning rod would be Mandara Mountain.</p>
<p>Poison would also be produced from the churning, but it would be taken by Lord Siva, and so there would be no need to fear it.</p>
<p>Many other attractive things would be generated by the churning, but the Lord warned the demigods not to be captivated by such things.</p>
<p>Nor should the demigods be angry if there were some disturbances.</p>
<p>After advising the demigods in this way, the Lord disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods established a peace with Maharaja Bali, the King of the demons.</p>
<p>Then both the demons and the demigods started for the ocean, taking Mandara Mountain with them.</p>
<p>Because of the great heaviness of the mountain, the demigods and demons became fatigued, and some of them actually died.</p>
<p>Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, appeared there on the back of His carrier, Garuda, and by His mercy He brought these demigods and demons back to life.</p>
<p>The Lord then lifted the mountain with one of His hands and placed it on the back of Garuda.</p>
<p>The Lord sat on the mountain and was carried to the spot of the churning by Garuda, who placed the mountain in the middle of the sea.</p>
<p>Then the Lord asked Garuda to leave that place because as long as Garuda was present, Vasuki could not come there.</p>

<p>Since His incarnations are eternal, the various activities performed by these incarnations are also eternal.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not appear because He is forced to do so by karma like ordinary living entities who are forced to accept a certain type of body.</p>
<p>It is to be understood that the Lord’s body and activities are all transcendental, being free from the contamination of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>These pastimes are transcendental bliss to the Lord.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the Lord’s appearance in different incarnations.</p>
<p>All of these incarnations are eternal, blissful and full of knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As one can derive fire from wood, milk from the milk bag of the cow, food grains and water from the land, and prosperity in one’s livelihood from industrial enterprises, so, by the practice of bhakti-yoga, even within this material world, one can achieve Your favor or intelligently approach You.</p>
<p>Those who are pious all affirm this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is nirguna, not to be found within this material world, the entire material world is pervaded by Him, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (maya tatam idam sarvam).</p>
<p>The material world is nothing but an expansion of the Lord’s material energy, and the entire cosmic manifestation rests upon Him (mat-sthani sarva-bhutani).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Supreme Lord cannot be found here (na caham tesv avasthitah).</p>
<p>A devotee, however, can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the practice of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>One ordinarily does not begin to practice bhakti-yoga unless he has practiced it in previous births.</p>
<p>Moreover, one can begin bhakti-yoga only by the mercy of the spiritual master and Krsna.</p>
<p>Guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija.</p>
<p>The seed of devotional service is obtainable by the mercy of guru, the spiritual master, and Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Only by the practice of bhakti-yoga can one achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and see Him face to face (premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santah sadaiva hrdayesu vilokayanti (Bs.5.38)).</p>
<p>One cannot see the Lord by other methods, such as karma, jnana or yoga.</p>
<p>Under the direction of the spiritual master, one must cultivate bhakti-yoga (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam (SB 7.5.23)).</p>
<p>Then, even within this material world, although the Lord is not visible, a devotee can see Him.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah (Bg.18.55)) and in Srimad-Bhagavatam (bhaktyaham ekaya grahyah).</p>
<p>Thus by devotional service one can achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although He is not visible or understandable to materialistic persons.</p>
<p>In this verse, the cultivation of bhakti-yoga is compared to many material activities.</p>
<p>By friction one can get fire from wood, by digging the earth one can get food grains and water, and by agitating the milk bag of the cow one can get nectarean milk.</p>
<p>Milk is compared to nectar, which one can drink to become immortal.</p>
<p>Of course, simply drinking milk will not make one immortal, but it can increase the duration of one’s life.</p>
<p>In modern civilization, men do not think milk to be important, and therefore they do not live very long.</p>
<p>Although in this age men can live up to one hundred years, their duration of life is reduced because they do not drink large quantities of milk.</p>
<p>This is a sign of Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, instead of drinking milk, people prefer to slaughter an animal and eat its flesh.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His instructions of Bhagavad-gita, advises go-raksya, which means cow protection.</p>
<p>The cow should be protected, milk should be drawn from the cows, and this milk should be prepared in various ways.</p>
<p>One should take ample milk, and thus one can prolong one’s life, develop his brain, execute devotional service, and ultimately attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As it is essential to get food grains and water by digging the earth, it is also essential to give protection to the cows and take nectarean milk from their milk bags.</p>
<p>The people of this age are inclined toward industrial enterprises for comfortable living, but they refuse to endeavor to execute devotional service, by which they can achieve the ultimate goal of life by returning home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as it is said, na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum durasaya ye bahir-artha-maninah (SB 7.5.31).</p>
<p>People without spiritual education do not know that the ultimate goal of life is to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Forgetting this aim of life, they are working very hard in disappointment and frustration (moghasa mogha-karmano mogha jnana vicetasah (Bg.9.12)).</p>
<p>The so-called vaisyas—the industrialists or businessmen—are involved in big, big industrial enterprises, but they are not interested in food grains and milk.</p>
<p>However, as indicated here, by digging for water, even in the desert, we can produce food grains; when we produce food grains and vegetables, we can give protection to the cows; while giving protection to the cows, we can draw from them abundant quantities of milk; and by getting enough milk and combining it with food grains and vegetables, we can prepare hundreds of nectarean foods.</p>
<p>We can happily eat this food and thus avoid industrial enterprises and joblessness.</p>
<p>Agriculture and cow protection are the way to become sinless and thus be attracted to devotional service.</p>
<p>Those who are sinful cannot be attracted by devotional service.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):</p>
<p>yesam tv anta-gatam papam</p>
<p>jananam punya-karmanam</p>
<p>te dvandva-moha-nirmukta</p>
<p>bhajante mam drdha-vratah</p>
<p>Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination The majority of people in this age of Kali are sinful, short-living, unfortunate and disturbed (mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah (SB 1.1.10)).</p>
<p>For them, Caitanya Mahaprabhu has advised:</p>
<p>harer nama harer nama</p>
<p>harer namaiva kevalam</p>
<p>kalau nasty eva nasty eva</p>
<p>nasty eva gatir anyatha</p>
<p>(Adi 17.21)</p>
<p>In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tam—O Lord; tvam—Your Lordship; vayam—all of us; natha—O master; samujjihanam—now appearing before us with all glories; saroja-nabha—O Lord, whose navel resembles a lotus flower, or from whose navel grows a lotus flower; ati-cira—for an extremely long time; ipsita—desiring; artham—for the ultimate goal of life; drstva—seeing; gatah—in our vision; nirvrtam—transcendental happiness; adya—today; sarve—all of us; gajah—elephants; dava-artah—being afflicted in a forest fire; iva—like; gangam ambhah—with water from the Ganges.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Elephants afflicted by a forest fire become very happy when they get water from the Ganges.</p>
<p>Similarly, O my Lord, from whose navel grows a lotus flower, since You have now appeared before us, we have become transcendentally happy.</p>
<p>By seeing Your Lordship, whom we have desired to see for a very long time, we have achieved our ultimate goal in life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The devotees of the Lord are always very eager to see the Supreme Lord face to face, but they do not demand that the Lord come before them, for a pure devotee considers such a demand to be contrary to devotional service.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu teaches this lesson in His Siksastaka.</p>
<p>Adarsanan marma-hatam karotu va.</p>
<p>The devotee is always eager to see the Lord face to face, but if he is brokenhearted because he cannot see the Lord, even life after life, he will never command the Lord to appear.</p>
<p>This is a sign of pure devotion.</p>
<p>Therefore in this verse we find the word ati-cira-ipsita-artham, meaning that the devotee aspires for a long, long time to see the Lord.</p>
<p>If the Lord, by His own pleasure, appears before the devotee, the devotee feels extremely happy, as Dhruva Maharaja felt when he personally saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When Dhruva Maharaja saw the Lord, he had no desire to ask the Lord for any benediction.</p>
<p>Indeed, simply by seeing the Lord, Dhruva Maharaja felt so satisfied that he did not want to ask the Lord for any benediction (svamin krtartho ’smi varam na yace).</p>
<p>A pure devotee, whether able or unable to see the Lord, always engages in the Lord’s devotional service, always hoping that at some time the Lord may be pleased to appear before him so that he can see the Lord face to face.</p>

<p>Krsna, by His grace, will supply whatever we need in executing our devotional service.</p>

<p>Since we are particles of You, what can we understand about our welfare? O Supreme Lord, please give us the means of deliverance that is suitable for the brahmanas and demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, the word dvija-deva-mantram is very important.</p>
<p>The word mantra means that which delivers one from the material world Only the dvijas (the brahmanas) and the devas (the demigods) can be delivered from material existence by the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a mantra and is suitable for delivering the conditioned souls from mental speculation.</p>
<p>The conditioned souls are engaged in a struggle for existence (manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati (Bg.15.7)).</p>
<p>Deliverance from this struggle constitutes the highest benefit, but unless one gets a mantra from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, deliverance is impossible.</p>
<p>The beginning mantra is the Gayatri mantra.</p>
<p>Therefore, after purification, when one is qualified to become a brahmana (dvija), he is offered the Gayatri mantra.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the Gayatri mantra, one can be delivered.</p>
<p>This mantra, however, is suitable only for the brahmanas and demigods.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, we are all in a very difficult position, in which we need a suitable mantra that can deliver us from the dangers of this age.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, gives us the Hare Krsna mantra harer nama harer nama</p>
<p>harer namaiva kevalam</p>
<p>kalau nasty eva nasty eva</p>
<p>nasty eva gatir anyatha</p>
<p>(Adi 17.21)</p>
<p>In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way In His Siksastaka, Lord Caitanya says, param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam: All glories to the chanting of sri-krsna-sankirtana The maha-mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—is directly chanted by the Lord Himself, who gives us this mantra for deliverance.</p>
<p>We cannot invent any means to be delivered from the dangers of material existence.</p>
<p>Here, even the demigods, such as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, and the prajapatis, such as Daksa, are said to be like illuminating sparks in the presence of the Supreme Lord, who is compared to a great fire.</p>
<p>Sparks are beautiful as long as they are in the fire.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have to remain in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and always engage in devotional service, for then we shall always be brilliant and illuminating.</p>
<p>As soon as we fall from the service of the Lord, our brilliance and illumination will immediately be extinguished, or at least stopped for some time.</p>
<p>When we living entities, who are like sparks of the original fire, the Supreme Lord, fall into a material condition, we must take the mantra from the Supreme Personality of Godhead as it is offered by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>By chanting this Hare Krsna mantra, we shall be delivered from all the difficulties of this material world.</p>

<p>Thus the demons will be engaged in labor, but you, the demigods, will gain the actual result, the nectar produced from the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that when different kinds of drugs, creepers, grass and vegetables are put into this milk and the milk is churned, as milk is churned for butter, the active principles of the vegetables and drugs mix with the milk, and the result is nectar.</p>

<p>This kind of treatment was prevalent even during the fight between the Pandavas and the Kurus.</p>

<p>The demigods, of course, had similar intentions.</p>
<p>The only difference is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, was on the side of the demigods because the demigods were His devotees, whereas the demons did not care about Lord Visnu.</p>

<p>The Lord very easily lifted the mountain with one hand and placed it on the back of Garuda.</p>
<p>Then, He too got on the back of Garuda and went to the ocean of milk, surrounded by the demigods and demons.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is proof of the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is above everyone.</p>
<p>There are two classes of living entities—the demons and the demigods—and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is above them both.</p>
<p>The demons believe in the chanc theory of creation, whereas the demigods believe in creation by the hand of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The omnipotence of the Supreme Lord is proved here, for simply with one hand He lifted Mandara Mountain, the demigods and the demons, placed them on the back of Garuda and brought them to the ocean of milk.</p>
<p>Now, the demigods, the devotees, would immediately accept this incident, knowing that the Lord can lift anything, however heavy it might be.</p>
<p>But although demons were also carried along with the demigods, demons, upon hearing of this incident, would say that it is mythological.</p>
<p>But if God is all-powerful, why would it be difficult for Him to lift a mountain? Since He is floating innumerable planets with many hundreds and thousands of Mandara Mountains, why can’t He lift one of them with His hand? This is not mythology, but the difference between the believers and the faithless is that the devotees accept the incidents mentioned in the Vedic literatures to be true, whereas the demons simply argue and label all these historical incidents mythology.</p>
<p>Demons would prefer to explain that everything happening in the cosmic manifestation takes place by chance, but demigods, or devotees, never consider anything to be chance.</p>
<p>Rather, they know that everything is an arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That is the difference between the demigods and the demons.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, Garuda, the chief of birds, unloaded Mandara Mountain from his shoulder and brought it near the water.</p>
<p>Then he was asked by the Lord to leave that place, and he left.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Garuda was asked by the Lord to leave that place because the snake Vasuki, who was to be used as the rope for churning, could not go there in the presence of Garuda.</p>
<p>Garuda, the carrier of Lord Visnu, is not a vegetarian.</p>
<p>He eats big snakes.</p>
<p>Vasuki, being a great snake, would be natural food for Garuda, the chief of birds.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu therefore asked Garuda to leave so that Vasuki could be brought to churn the ocean with Mandara Mountain, which was to be used as the churning rod.</p>
<p>These are the wonderful arrangements of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Nothing takes place by accident.</p>
<p>Carrying Mandara Mountain on the back of a bird and putting it in its right position might be difficult for anyone, whether demigod or demon, but for the Supreme Personality of Godhead everything is possible, as shown by this pastime.</p>
<p>The Lord had no difficulty lifting the mountain with one hand, and Garuda, His carrier, carried all the demons and demigods together by the grace of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is known as Yogesvara, the master of all mystic power, because of His omnipotence.</p>
<p>If He likes, He can make anything lighter than cotton or heavier than the universe.</p>
<p>Those who do not believe in the activities of the Lord cannot explain how things happen.</p>
<p>Using words like accident they take shelter of ideas that are unbelievable.</p>
<p>Nothing is accidental.</p>
<p>Everything is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (9.10).</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-5" id="summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#87" id="87">8.7</a></h3>
<p>The summary of the Seventh Chapter is as follows.</p>
<p>As described in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appearing in His incarnation as a tortoise, dove deep into the ocean to carry Mandara Mountain on His back.</p>
<p>At first the churning of the ocean produced kalakuta poison.</p>
<p>Everyone feared this poison, but Lord Siva satisfied them by drinking it.</p>
<p>With the understanding that when the nectar was generated from the churning they would share it equally, the demigods and the demons brought Vasuki to be used as the rope for the churning rod.</p>
<p>By the expert arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demons held the snake near the mouth, whereas the demigods held the tail of the great snake.</p>
<p>Then, with great endeavor, they began pulling the snake in both directions.</p>
<p>Because the churning rod, Mandara Mountain, was very heavy and was not held by any support in the water, it sank into the ocean, and in this way the prowess of both the demons and the demigods was vanquished.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead then appeared in the form of a tortoise and supported Mandara Mountain on His back.</p>
<p>Then the churning resumed with great force.</p>
<p>As a result of the churning, a huge amount of poison was produced.</p>
<p>The prajapatis, seeing no one else to save them, approached Lord Siva and offered him prayers full of truth.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is called Asutosa because he is very pleased if one is a devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore he easily agreed to drink all the poison generated by the churning.</p>
<p>The goddess Durga, Bhavani, the wife of Lord Siva, was not at all disturbed when Lord Siva agreed to drink the poison, for she knew Lord Siva’s prowess.</p>
<p>Indeed, she expressed her pleasure at this agreement.</p>
<p>Then Lord Siva gathered the devastating poison, which was everywhere.</p>
<p>He took it in his hand and drank it.</p>
<p>After he drank the poison, his neck became bluish.</p>
<p>A small quantity of the poison dropped from his hands to the ground, and it is because of this poison that there are poisonous snakes, scorpions, toxic plants and other poisonous things in this world.</p>

<p>The leaders of the demons thought it unwise to hold the tail, the inauspicious portion of the snake.</p>
<p>Instead, they wanted to hold the front, which had been taken by the Personality of Godhead and the demigods, because that portion was auspicious and glorious.</p>
<p>Thus the demons, on the plea that they were all highly advanced students of Vedic knowledge and were all famous for their birth and activities, protested that they wanted to hold the front of the snake.</p>

<p>The demons thought that the front of the snake was auspicious and that catching hold of that portion would be more chivalrous.</p>

<p>We are advocating cow protection and encouraging people to drink more milk and eat palatable preparations made of milk, but the demons, just to protest such proposals, are claiming that they are advanced in scientific knowledge, as described here by the words svadhyaya-sruta-sampannah.</p>
<p>They say that according to their scientific way, they have discovered that milk is dangerous and that the beef obtained by killing cows is very nutritious.</p>
<p>This difference of opinion will always continue.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has existed since days of yore.</p>
<p>Millions of years ago, there was the same competition.</p>
<p>The demons, as a result of their so-called Vedic study, preferred to hold the side of the snake near the mouth.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead thought it wise to catch hold of the dangerous part of the snake and allow the demons to hold the tail, which was not dangerous, but because of a competitive desire, the demons thought it wise to hold the snake near the mouth.</p>
<p>If the demigods were going to drink poison, the demons would resolve, Why should we not share the poison and die gloriously by drinking it In regard to the words svadhyaya-sruta-sampannah prakhyata janma-karmabhih, another question may be raised.</p>
<p>If one is actually educated in Vedic knowledge, is famous for performing prescribed activities and has been born in a great aristocratic family, why should he be called a demon? The answer is that one may be highly educated and may have been born in an aristocratic family, but if he is godless, if he does not listen to the instructions of God, then he is a demon.</p>
<p>There are many examples in history of men like Hiranyakasipu, Ravana and Kamsa who were well educated, who were born in aristocratic families and who were very powerful and chivalrous in fighting, but who, because of deriding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, were called Raksasas, or demons.</p>
<p>One may be very well educated, but if he has no sense of Krsna consciousness, no obedience to the Supreme Lord, he is a demon.</p>
<p>That is described by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):</p>
<p>na mam duskrtino mudhah</p>
<p>prapadyante naradhamah</p>
<p>mayayapahrta-jnana</p>
<p>asuram bhavam asritah</p>
<p>Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me Asuram bhavam refers to not accepting the existence of God or the transcendental instructions of the Personality of Godhead.Bhagavad-gita clearly consists of transcendental instructions imparted directly by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But asuras, instead of accepting these instructions directly, make commentaries according to their own whimsical ways and mislead everyone, without profit even for themselves.</p>
<p>One should therefore be very careful of demoniac, godless persons.</p>
<p>According to the words of Lord Krsna, even if a godless demon is very well educated, he must be considered a mudha, naradhama and mayayapahrta jnana.</p>

<p>Here is evidence that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme controller of everything.</p>
<p>As we have previously described, there are two classes of men—the demons and the demigods—but neither of them are supremely powerful.</p>
<p>Everyone has experienced that hindrances are imposed upon us by the supreme power.</p>
<p>The demons regard these hindrances as mere accidents or chance, but devotees accept them to be acts of the supreme ruler.</p>
<p>When faced with hindrances, therefore, devotees pray to the Lord.</p>
<p>Tat te ’nukampam susamiksamano bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam.</p>
<p>Devotees endure hindrances, accepting them to be caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead and regarding them as benedictions.</p>
<p>Demons, however, being unable to understand the supreme controller, regard such hindrances as accidental.</p>
<p>Here, of course, the Supreme Personality of Godhead was present personally.</p>
<p>It was by His will that there were hindrances, and by His will those hindrances were removed.</p>
<p>The Lord appeared as a tortoise to support the great mountain.</p>

<p>tvam ekah—Your Lordship is indeed; sarva-jagatah—of the three worlds; isvarah—the controller; bandha-moksayoh—of both bondage and liberation; tam—that controller; tvam arcanti—worship you; kusalah—persons who want good fortune; prapanna-arti-haram—who can mitigate all the distresses of a sheltered devotee; gurum—you who act as a good advisor to all fallen souls.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O lord, you are the cause of bondage and liberation of the entire universe because you are its ruler.</p>
<p>Those who are advanced in spiritual consciousness surrender unto you, and therefore you are the cause of mitigating their distresses, and you are also the cause of their liberation.</p>
<p>We therefore worship Your Lordship.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Actually Lord Visnu maintains and accomplishes all good fortune.</p>
<p>If one has to take shelter of Lord Visnu, why should the demigods take shelter of Lord Siva? They did so because Lord Visnu acts through Lord Siva in the creation of the material world.</p>
<p>Lord Siva acts on behalf of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>When the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (14.4) that He is the father of all living entities (aham bija-pradah pita), this refers to actions performed by Lord Visnu through Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is always unattached to material activities, and when material activities are to be performed, Lord Visnu performs them through Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is therefore worshiped on the level of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>When Lord Visnu is untouched by the external energy He is Lord Visnu, but when He is in touch with the external energy, He appears in His feature as Lord Siva.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Lord Girisa, since the impersonal Brahman effulgence is transcendental to the material modes of goodness, passion and ignorance, the various directors of this material world certainly cannot appreciate it or even know where it is.</p>
<p>It is not understandable even to Lord Brahma, Lord Visnu or the King of heaven, Mahendra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The brahmajyoti is actually the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power.</p>
<p>The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes Although the impersonal feature of the Absolute is an expansion of the rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He does not need to take care of the impersonalists who enter the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.4), maya tatam idam sarvam jagad avyakta-murtina: In My impersonal feature I pervade this entire universe Thus the avyakta-murti, the impersonal feature, is certainly an expansion of Krsna’s energy.</p>
<p>Mayavadis, who prefer to merge into this Brahman effulgence, worship Lord Siva.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Lord Siva considers the great acts he performs to be very unimportant, what was to be said of counteracting the strong poison produced by the churning? The demigods indirectly prayed that Lord Siva counteract the kalakuta poison, which was spreading throughout the universe.</p>

<p>This is the characteristic of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Para-duhkha-duhkhi: a Vaisnava is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls unhappy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he would have no business teaching them how to become happy.</p>
<p>In materialistic life, people must certainly engage in activities of animosity.</p>
<p>Materialistic life is therefore compared to samsara-davanala, a blazing forest fire that automatically takes place.</p>

<p>This is the duty of devotees following the principles of Lord Siva and belonging to the Rudra-sampradaya.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>It is said that great personalities almost always accept voluntary suffering because of the suffering of people in general.</p>
<p>This is considered the highest method of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is an explanation of how those engaged in activities for the welfare of others are very quickly recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.68–69), ya idam paramam guhyam mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah: One who preaches the message of Bhagavad-gita to My devotees is most dear to Me.</p>
<p>No one can excel him in satisfying Me by worship There are different kinds of welfare activities in this material world, but the supreme welfare activity is the spreading of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Other welfare activities cannot be effective, for the laws of nature and the results of karma cannot be checked.</p>
<p>It is by destiny, or the laws of karma, that one must suffer or enjoy.</p>
<p>For instance, if one is given a court order, he must accept it, whether it brings suffering or profit.</p>
<p>Similarly, everyone is under obligations to karma and it reactions.</p>
<p>No one can change this.</p>
<p>Therefore the sastra says:</p>
<p>tasyaiva hetoh prayateta kovido</p>
<p>na labhyate yad bhramatam upary adhah</p>
<p>(Bhag.1.5.18)</p>
<p>One should endeavor for that which is never obtained by wandering up and down the universe as a result of the reactions of karma.</p>
<p>What is that? One should endeavor to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>If one tries to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world, he should be understood to be performing the best welfare activity.</p>
<p>The Lord is automatically very pleased with him.</p>
<p>If the Lord is pleased with him, what is left for him to achieve? If one has been recognized by the Lord, even if he does not ask the Lord for anything, the Lord, who is within everyone, supplies him whatever he wants.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (tesam nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham (Bg.9.22)).</p>
<p>Again, as stated here, tapyante loka-tapena sadhavah prayaso janah.</p>
<p>The best welfare activity is raising people to the platform of Krsna consciousness, since the conditioned souls are suffering only for want of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself also comes to mitigate the suffering of humanity yada yada hi dharmasya</p>
<p>glanir bhavati bharata</p>
<p>abhyutthanam adharmasya</p>
<p>tadatmanam srjamy aham</p>
<p>paritranaya sadhunam</p>
<p>vinasaya ca duskrtam</p>
<p>dharma-samsthapanarthaya</p>
<p>sambhavami yuge yuge</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself.</p>
<p>To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium (Bg.4.7–8) All the sastras conclude, therefore, that spreading the Krsna consciousness movement is the best welfare activity in the world.</p>
<p>Because of the ultimate benefit this bestows upon people in general, the Lord very quickly recognizes such service performed by a devotee.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-6" id="summary-6">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#88" id="88">8.8</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how the goddess of fortune appeared during the churning of the ocean of milk and how she accepted Lord Visnu as her husband.</p>
<p>As described later in the chapter, when Dhanvantari appeared with a pot of nectar the demons immediately snatched it from him, but Lord Visnu appeared as the incarnation Mohini, the most beautiful woman in the world, just to captivate the demons and save the nectar for the demigods.</p>
<p>After Lord Siva drank all the poison, both the demigods and demons took courage and resumed their activities of churning.</p>
<p>Because of this churning, first a surabhi cow was produced.</p>
<p>Great saintly persons accepted this cow to derive clarified butter from its milk and offer this clarified butter in oblations for great sacrifices.</p>
<p>Thereafter, a horse named Uccaihsrava was generated.</p>
<p>This horse was taken by Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Then there appeared Airavata and other elephants that could go anywhere in any direction, and she-elephants also appeared.</p>
<p>The gem known as Kaustubha was also generated, and Lord Visnu took that gem and placed it on His chest.</p>
<p>Thereafter, a parijata flower and the Apsaras, the most beautiful women in the universe, were generated.</p>
<p>Then the goddess of fortune, Laksmi, appeared.</p>
<p>The demigods, great sages, Gandharvas and others offered her their respectful worship.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune could not find anyone to accept as her husband.</p>
<p>At last she selected Lord Visnu to be her master.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu gave her a place to stay everlastingly at His chest.</p>
<p>Because of this combination of Laksmi and Narayana, all who were present, including the demigods and people in general, were very pleased.</p>
<p>The demons, however, being neglected by the goddess of fortune, were very depressed.</p>
<p>Then Varuni, the goddess of drinking, was generated, and by the order of Lord Visnu the demons accepted her.</p>
<p>Then the demons and demigods, with renewed energy, began to churn again.</p>
<p>This time a partial incarnation of Lord Visnu called Dhanvantari appeared.</p>
<p>He was very beautiful, and he carried a jug containing nectar.</p>
<p>The demons immediately snatched the jug from Dhanvantari’s hand and began to run away, and the demigods, being very morose, took shelter of Visnu.</p>
<p>After the demons snatched the jug from Dhanvantari, they began to fight among themselves.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu solaced the demigods, who therefore did not fight, but remained silent.</p>
<p>While the fighting was going on among the demons, the Lord Himself appeared as the incarnation Mohini, the most beautiful woman in the universe.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Upon Lord Siva’s drinking the poison, both the demigods and the demons, being very pleased, began to churn the ocean with renewed vigor.</p>
<p>As a result of this, there appeared a cow known as surabhi.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The surabhi cow is described as havirdhani, the source of butter.</p>
<p>Butter, when clarified by melting, produces ghee, or clarified butter, which is inevitably necessary for performing great ritualistic sacrifices.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18 5), yajna-dana-tapah-karma na tyajyam karyam eva tat: sacrifice, charity and austerity are essential to keep human society perfect in peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Yajna, the performance of sacrifice, is essential; to perform yajna, clarified butter is absolutely necessary; and to get clarified butter, milk is necessary.</p>
<p>Milk is produced when there are sufficient cows.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), cow protection is recommended (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhava jam).</p>

<p>tam—that cow; agni-hotrim—absolutely necessary for the production of yogurt, milk and ghee to offer as oblations in the fire; rsayah—sages who perform such sacrifices; jagrhuh—took in charge; brahma-vadinah—because such sages know the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies; yajnasya—of sacrifice; deva-yanasya—which fulfills the desire to be elevated to the higher planetary systems and to Brahmaloka; medhyaya—fit for offering oblations; havise—for the sake of pure clarified butter; nrpa—O King.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, great sages who were completely aware of the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies took charge of that surabhi cow, which produced all the yogurt, milk and ghee absolutely necessary for offering oblations into the fire.</p>
<p>They did this just for the sake of pure ghee, which they wanted for the performance of sacrifices to elevate themselves to the higher planetary systems, up to Brahmaloka.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Surabhi cows are generally found on the Vaikuntha planets.</p>
<p>As described in Brahma-samhita, Lord Krsna, on His planet, Goloka Vrndavana, engages in tending the surabhi cows (surabhir abhipalayantam (Bs.5.29)).</p>
<p>These cows are the Lord’s pet animals.</p>
<p>From the surabhi cows one can take as much milk as one needs, and one may milk these cows as many times as he desires.</p>
<p>In other words, the surabhi cow can yield milk unlimitedly.</p>
<p>Milk is necessary for the performance of yajna.</p>
<p>Sages know how to use milk to elevate human society to the perfection of life.</p>
<p>Since cow protection is recommended everywhere in the sastras, the brahma vadis took charge of the surabhi cow, in which the demons were not very interested.</p>

<p>When people know that the Supreme Lord, Krsna, is the supreme enjoyer, the supreme proprietor and the most intimate well-wishing friend of all living entities, peace and prosperity will ensue all over the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the conditioned souls, being placed into illusion by the external energy of the Lord, want to fight with one another, and therefore peace is disturbed.</p>
<p>The first prerequisite for peace is that all the wealth presented by Sri, the goddess of fortune, be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Everyone should give up his false proprietorship over worldly possessions and offer everything to Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of her exquisite beauty, her bodily features, her youth, her complexion and her glories, everyone, including the demigods, the demons and the human beings, desired her.</p>
<p>They were attracted because she is the source of all opulences.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Who in this world does not want to possess wealth, beauty and the social respectability that come from these opulences? People generally desire material enjoyment, material opulence and the association of aristocratic family members (bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam).</p>
<p>Material enjoyment entails money, beauty and the reputation they bring, which can all be achieved by the mercy of the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune, however, never remains alone.</p>
<p>As indicated in the previous verse by the word bhagavat-para, she is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is enjoyable only by Him.</p>
<p>If one wants the favor of the goddess of fortune, mother Laksmi, because she is by nature bhagavat-para one must keep her with Narayana.</p>
<p>The devotees who always engage in the service of Narayana (narayana-parayana) can easily achieve the favor of the goddess of fortune without a doubt, but materialists who try to get the favor of the goddess of fortune only to possess her for personal enjoyment are frustrated.</p>
<p>Theirs is not a good policy.</p>
<p>The celebrated demon Ravana, for example, wanted to deprive Ramacandra of Laksmi, Sita, and thus be victorious, but the result was just the opposite.</p>
<p>Sita, of course, was taken by force by Lord Ramacandra, and Ravana and his entire material empire were vanquished.</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune is desirable for everyone, including human beings, but one should understand that the goddess of fortune is the exclusive property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One cannot achieve the mercy of the goddess of fortune unless one prays both to her and to the supreme enjoyer, the Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>abhisecanikah—paraphernalia required for installing the Deity; bhumih—the land; aharat—collected; sakala—all kinds of; ausadhih—drugs and herbs; gavah—the cows; panca—five different varieties of products from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, clarified butter, cow dung and cow urine; pavitrani—uncontaminated; vasantah—personified springtime; madhu-madhavau—flowers and fruits produced during spring, or in the months of Caitra and Vaisakha.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The land became a person and collected all the drugs and herbs needed for installing the Deity.</p>
<p>The cows delivered five products, namely milk, yogurt, ghee, urine and cow dung, and spring personified collected everything produced in spring, during the months of Caitra and Vaisakha (April and May).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Panca-gavya, the five products received from the cow, namely milk, yogurt, ghee, cow dung and cow urine, are required in all ritualistic ceremonies performed according to the Vedic directions.</p>
<p>Cow urine and cow dung are uncontaminated, and since even the urine and dung of a cow are important, we can just imagine how important this animal is for human civilization.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, directly advocates go-raksya, the protection of cows.</p>
<p>Civilized men who follow the system of varnasrama, especially those of the vaisya class, who engage in agriculture and trade, must give protection to the cows.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because people in Kali-yuga are mandah, all bad, and sumanda-matayah, misled by false conceptions of life, they are killing cows in the thousands.</p>
<p>Therefore they are unfortunate in spiritual consciousness, and nature disturbs them in so many ways, especially through incurable diseases like cancer and through frequent wars and among nations.</p>
<p>As long as human society continues to allow cows to be regularly killed in slaughterhouses, there cannot be any question of peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>The goddess of fortune is the most chaste, for she does not know anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>The goddess of fortune, Laksmi, is described in this verse as sriyam, which means that she has six opulences—wealth, strength, influence, beauty, knowledge and renunciation.</p>
<p>These opulences are received from the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p>Laksmi is addressed here as devi, the goddess, because in Vaikuntha she supplies all opulences to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees, who in this way enjoy natural life in the Vaikuntha planets.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased with His consort, the goddess of fortune, who carries a lotus flower in her hand.</p>
<p>Mother Laksmi is described in this verse as sati, the supremely chaste, because she never diverts her attention from the Supreme Personality of Godhead to anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While walking among the Gandharvas, Yaksas, asuras, Siddhas, Caranas and denizens of heaven, Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, was scrutinizingly examining them, but she could not find anyone naturally endowed with all good qualities.</p>
<p>None of them was devoid of faults, and therefore she could not take shelter of any of them.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The goddess of fortune, examining the assembly, thought in this way: Someone who has undergone great austerity has not yet conquered anger.</p>
<p>Someone possesses knowledge, but he has not conquered material desires.</p>
<p>Someone is a very great personality, but he cannot conquer lusty desires.</p>
<p>Even a great personality depends on something else.</p>
<p>How, then, can he be the supreme controller?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is an attempt to find the supreme controller, or isvara.</p>
<p>Everyone may be accepted as an isvara, or controller, but still such controllers are controlled by others.</p>
<p>For example, one may have undergone severe austerities but still be under the control of anger.</p>
<p>By a scrutinizing analysis, we find that everyone is controlled by something else.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Someone may possess full knowledge of religion but still not be kind to all living entities.</p>
<p>In someone, whether human or demigod, there may be renunciation, but that is not the cause of liberation.</p>
<p>Someone may possess great power and yet be unable to check the power of eternal time.</p>
<p>Someone else may have renounced attachment to the material world, yet he cannot compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, no one is completely freed from the influence of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The statement dharmah kvacit tatra na bhuta-sauhrdam is very important in this verse.</p>
<p>We actually see that there are many Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists and religionists of other cults who adhere to their religious principles very nicely but are not equal to all living entities.</p>
<p>Indeed, although they profess to be very religious, they kill poor animals.</p>
<p>Such religion has no meaning.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.8) says:</p>
<p>dharmah svanusthitah pumsam</p>
<p>visvaksena-kathasu yah</p>
<p>notpadayed yadi ratim</p>
<p>srama eva hi kevalam</p>
<p>One may be very expert in following the religious principles of his own sect, but if he has no tendency to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his observance of religious principles is simply a waste of time.</p>
<p>One must develop a sense of loving Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah (Bg.7.19)).</p>
<p>The sign of a devotee is that he is a friend to everyone (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam).</p>
<p>A devotee will never allow a poor animal to be killed in the name of religion.</p>
<p>This is the difference between a superficially religious person and a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>We find that there have been many great heroes in history, but they could not escape from the cruel hands of death.</p>
<p>Even the greatest hero cannot escape from the ruling power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead when Krsna comes as death.</p>
<p>That is described by Krsna Himself: mrtyuh sarva-haras caham.</p>
<p>The Lord, appearing as death, takes away a hero’s so-called power.</p>
<p>Even Hiranyakasipu could not be saved when Nrsimhadeva appeared before him as death.</p>
<p>One’s material strength is nothing before the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Mukunda, is self-sufficient.</p>

<p>O King, a quarrel then arose among the demons over who would get the nectar first.</p>
<p>Each of them said, You cannot drink it first.</p>
<p>I must drink it first.</p>
<p>Me first, not you</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the symptom of demons.</p>
<p>The first concern of a nondevotee is how to enjoy his personal sense gratification at once, whereas the devotee’s first concern is to satisfy the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the distinction between the nondevotee and the devotee.</p>
<p>In this material world, since most people are nondevotees, they regularly compete, fight, disagree and war among themselves, for everyone wants to enjoy and satisfy his own senses.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless such demons become Krsna conscious and are trained to satisfy the senses of the Lord, there can be no question of peace in human society or any society, even that of the demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods and devotees, however, always surrender to the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus the Lord is always anxious to satisfy their ambitions.</p>
<p>While the demons fight to satisfy their own senses, devotees engage in devotional service to satisfy the senses of the Lord.</p>
<p>The members of the Krsna consciousness movement must be alert in regard to this point, and then their preaching of the Krsna consciousness movement will be successful.</p>

<p>Some of the demons said, All the demigods have taken part in churning the ocean of milk.</p>

<p>Her hair, which was extremely beautiful, was garlanded with mallika flowers.</p>
<p>Her attractively constructed neck was decorated with a necklace and other ornaments, Her arms were decorated with bangles, Her body was covered with a clean sari, and Her breasts seemed like islands in an ocean of beauty.</p>
<p>Her legs were decorated with ankle bells.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#89" id="89">8.9</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how the demons, being enchanted by the beauty of the Mohini form, agreed to hand over the container of nectar to Mohinidevi, who tactfully delivered it to the demigods.</p>
<p>When the demons got possession of the container of nectar, an extraordinarily beautiful young woman appeared before them.</p>
<p>All the demons became captivated by the young woman’s beauty and became attached to Her.</p>
<p>Now, because the demons were fighting among themselves to possess the nectar, they selected this beautiful woman as a mediator to settle their quarrel.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of their weakness in this regard, Mohini, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, got the demons to promise that whatever decision She might give, they would not refuse to accept it.</p>
<p>When the demons made this promise, the beautiful woman, Mohini-murti, had the demigods and demons sit in different lines so that She could distribute the nectar.</p>
<p>She knew that the demons were quite unfit to drink the nectar.</p>
<p>Therefore, by cheating them She distributed all the nectar to the demigods.</p>
<p>When the demons saw this cheating of Mohini-murti, they remained silent.</p>
<p>But one demon, named Rahu, dressed himself like a demigod and sat down in the line of the demigods.</p>
<p>He sat beside the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead understood how Rahu was cheating, He immediately cut off the demon’s head.</p>
<p>Rahu, however, had already tasted the nectar, and therefore although his head was severed, he remained alive.</p>
<p>After the demigods finished drinking the nectar, the Supreme Personality of Godhead assumed His own form.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by describing how powerful is the chanting of the holy names, pastimes and paraphernalia of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>Even the asuras observed the etiquette that no one should address a married woman with lust.</p>
<p>The great analyst Canakya Pandita says, matrvat para-daresu: one should consider another’s wife to be one’s mother.</p>
<p>The asuras, the demons, took it for granted that the beautiful young woman, Mohini-murti, who had arrived before them, was certainly not married.</p>
<p>Therefore they assumed that no one in the world, including the demigods, the Gandharvas, the Caranas and the Siddhas, had ever touched Her.</p>
<p>The demons knew that the young girl was unmarried, and therefore they dared to address Her.</p>
<p>They supposed that the young girl, Mohini-murti, had come there to find a husband among all those present (the Daityas, the demigods, the Gandharvas and so on).</p>

<p>Therefore they unanimously requested Her to become the arbiter to settle their dispute.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the form of Mohini, told the demons: O sons of Kasyapa Muni, I am only a prostitute.</p>
<p>How is it that you have so much faith in Me? A learned person never puts his faith in a woman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Canakya Pandita, the great politician and moral instructor, said, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu ca: Never put your faith in a woman or a politician Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who was pretending to be a woman, warned the demons against putting so much faith in Her, for She had appeared as an attractive woman ultimately to cheat them.</p>
<p>Indirectly disclosing the purpose for which She had appeared before them, She said to the sons of Kasyapa, How is this? You were all born of a great rsi, yet you are putting your faith in a woman who is loitering here and there like a prostitute, unprotected by father or husband.</p>
<p>Women in general should not be trusted, and what to speak of a woman loitering like a prostitute The word kamini is significant in this connection.</p>
<p>Women, especially beautiful young women, invoke the dormant lusty desires of a man.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to Manu-samhita, every woman should be protected, either by her husband, by her father or by her grown sons.</p>
<p>Without such protection, a woman will be exploited.</p>
<p>Indeed, women like to be exploited by men.</p>
<p>As soon as a woman is exploited by a man, she becomes a common prostitute.</p>
<p>This is explained by Mohini-murti, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: After the demons heard the words of Mohini-murti, who had spoken as if jokingly, they were all very confident.</p>
<p>They laughed with gravity, and ultimately they delivered the container of nectar into Her hands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead in His form of Mohini was certainly not joking but talking seriously, with gravity.</p>
<p>The demons, however, being captivated by Mohini-murti’s bodily features, took Her words as a joke and confidently delivered the container of nectar into Her hands.</p>
<p>Thus Mohini-murti resembles Lord Buddha, who appeared sammohaya sura-dvisam (SB 1.3.24)—to cheat the asuras.</p>
<p>The word sura-dvisam refers to those who are envious of the demigods or devotees.</p>
<p>Sometimes an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cheats the atheists.</p>
<p>Thus we see here that although Mohini-murti was speaking factually to the asuras, the asuras took Her words to be facetious.</p>
<p>Indeed, they were so confident of Mohini-murti’s honesty that they immediately delivered the container of nectar into Her hands, as if they would allow Her to do with the nectar whatever She liked, whether She distributed it, threw it away or drank it Herself without giving it to them.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot abide by anyone’s dictation.</p>

<p>The goddess of fortune is beautiful, but if the Lord accepts the form of a woman, He surpasses the goddess of fortune in beauty.</p>
<p>It is not that the goddess of fortune, being female, is the most beautiful.</p>

<p>The moon and sun, however, were always alert in regard to Rahu.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The place, the time, the cause, the purpose, the activity and the ambition were all the same for both the demigods and the demons, but the demigods achieved one result and the demons another.</p>
<p>Because the demigods are always under the shelter of the dust of the Lord’s lotus feet, they could very easily drink the nectar and get its result.</p>
<p>The demons, however, not having sought shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord, were unable to achieve the result they desired.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) it is said, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme judge who rewards or punishes different persons according to their surrender unto His lotus feet.</p>
<p>Therefore it can actually be seen that although karmis and bhaktas may work in the same place, at the same time, with the same energy and with the same ambition, they achieve different results.</p>
<p>The karmis transmigrate through different bodies in the cycle of birth and death, sometimes going upward and sometimes downward, thus suffering the results of their actions in the karma-cakra, the cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>The devotees, however, because of fully surrendering at the lotus feet of the Lord, are never baffled in their attempts.</p>
<p>Although externally they work almost like the karmis, the devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and achieve success in every effort.</p>
<p>The demons or atheists have faith in their own endeavors, but although they work very hard day and night, they cannot get any more than their destiny.</p>
<p>The devotees, however, can surpass the reactions of karma and achieve wonderful results, even without effort.</p>
<p>It is also said, phalena pariciyate: one’s success or defeat in any activity is understood by its result.</p>
<p>There are many karmis in the dress of devotees, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead can detect their purpose.</p>
<p>The karmis want to use the property of the Lord for their selfish sense gratification, but a devotee endeavors to use the Lord’s property for God’s service.</p>
<p>Therefore a devotee is always distinct from the karmis, although the karmis may dress like devotees.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah.</p>
<p>One who works for Lord Visnu is free from this material world, and after giving up his body he goes back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>A karmi, however, although externally working like a devotee, is entangled in his nondevotional activity, and thus he suffers the tribulations of material existence.</p>
<p>Thus from the results achieved by the karmis and devotees, one can understand the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who acts differently for the karmis and jnanis than for the devotees.</p>
<p>The author of Sri Caitanya-caritamrta therefore says:</p>
<p>krsna-bhakta——niskama, ataeva ‘santa’</p>
<p>bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kami——sakali ‘asanta’</p>
<p>The karmis who desire sense gratification, the jnanis who aspire for the liberation of merging into the existence of the Supreme, and the yogis who seek material success in mystic power are all restless, and ultimately they are baffled.</p>
<p>But the devotee, who does not expect any personal benefit and whose only ambition is to spread the glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is blessed with all the auspicious results of bhakti-yoga, without hard labor.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In human society there are various activities performed for the protection of one’s wealth and life by one’s words, one’s mind and one’s actions, but they are all performed for one’s personal or extended sense gratification with reference to the body.</p>
<p>All these activities are baffled because of being separate from devotional service.</p>
<p>But when the same activities are performed for the satisfaction of the Lord, the beneficial results are distributed to everyone, just as water poured on the root of a tree is distributed throughout the entire tree.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the distinction between materialistic activities and activities performed in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The entire world is active, and this includes the karmis, the jnanis, the yogis and the bhaktas.</p>
<p>However, all activities except those of the bhaktas, the devotees, end in bafflement and a waste of time and energy.</p>
<p>Moghasa mogha-karmano mogha jnana vicetasah: (Bg.9.12) if one is not a devotee, his hopes, his activities and his knowledge are all baffled.</p>
<p>A nondevotee works for his personal sense gratification or for the sense gratification of his family, society, community or nation, but because all such activities are separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are considered asat.</p>
<p>The word asat means bad or temporary, and sat means permanent and good.</p>
<p>Activities performed for the satisfaction of Krsna are permanent and good, but asat activity, although sometimes celebrated as philanthropy, altruism, nationalism, this is or that ism will never produce any permanent result and is therefore all bad.</p>
<p>Even a little work done in Krsna consciousness is a permanent asset and is all-good because it is done for Krsna, the all-good Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is everyone’s friend (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam).</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the only enjoyer and proprietor of everything (bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram (Bg.5.29)).</p>
<p>Therefore any activity performed for the Supreme Lord is permanent.</p>
<p>As a result of such activities, the performer is immediately recognized.</p>
<p>Na ca tasman manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah (Bg.18.69).</p>
<p>Such a devotee, because of full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is immediately transcendental, although he may superficially appear to be engaged in materialistic activities.</p>
<p>The only distinction between materialistic activity and spiritual activity is that material activity is performed only to satisfy one’s own senses whereas spiritual activity is meant to satisfy the transcendental senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>By spiritual activity everyone factually benefits, whereas by materialistic activity no one benefits and instead one becomes entangled in the laws of karma.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-8" id="summary-8">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#810" id="810">8.10</a></h3>
<p>The summary of Chapter Ten is as follows.</p>
<p>Because of envy, the fight between the demons and the demigods continued.</p>
<p>When the demigods were almost defeated by demoniac maneuvers and became morose, Lord Visnu appeared among them.</p>
<p>Both the demigods and the demons are expert in activities involving the material energy, but the demigods are devotees of the Lord, whereas the demons are just the opposite.</p>
<p>The demigods and demons churned the ocean of milk to get nectar from it, but the demons, not being devotees of the Lord, could derive no profit.</p>
<p>After feeding nectar to the demigods, Lord Visnu returned to His abode on the back of Garuda, but the demons, being most aggrieved, again declared war against the demigods.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, the son of Virocana, became the commander in chief of the demons.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the battle, the demigods prepared to defeat the demons.</p>
<p>Indra, King of heaven, fought with Bali, and other demigods, like Vayu, Agni and Varuna, fought against other leaders of the demons.</p>
<p>In this fight the demons were defeated, and to save themselves from death they began to manifest many illusions through material maneuvers, killing many soldiers on the side of the demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods, finding no other recourse, surrendered again to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who then appeared and counteracted all the illusions presented by the jugglery of the demons.</p>
<p>Heroes among the demons such as Kalanemi, Mali, Sumali and Malyavan fought the Supreme Personality of Godhead and were all killed by the Lord.</p>
<p>The demigods were thus freed from all dangers.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of the impact on the ground of the legs of the demons and demigods and the wheels of the chariots, particles of dust flew violently into the sky and made a dust cloud that covered all directions of outer space, as far as the sun.</p>
<p>But when the particles of dust were followed by drops of blood being sprinkled all over space, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The cloud of dust covered the entire horizon, but when drops of blood sprayed up as far as the sun, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky.</p>
<p>A point to be observed here is that although the blood is stated to have reached the sun, it is not said to have reached the moon.</p>
<p>Apparently, therefore, as stated elsewhere in Srimad-Bhagavatam, the sun, not the moon, is the planet nearest the earth.</p>
<p>We have already discussed this point in many places.</p>
<p>The sun is first, then the moon, then Mars, Jupiter and so on.</p>
<p>The sun is supposed to be 93,000,000 miles above the surface of the earth, and from the Srimad-Bhagavatam we understand that the moon is 1,600,000 miles above the sun.</p>
<p>Therefore the distance between the earth and the moon would be about 95,000,000 miles.</p>
<p>So if a space capsule were traveling at the speed of 18,000 miles per hour, how could it reach the moon in four days? At that speed, going to the moon would take at least seven months.</p>
<p>That a space capsule on a moon excursion has reached the moon in four days is therefore impossible.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-9" id="summary-9">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#811-1" id="811-1">8.11</a></h3>
<p>As described in this chapter, the great saint Narada Muni, being very compassionate to the demons who had been killed by the demigods, forbade the demigods to continue killing.</p>
<p>Then Sukracarya, by his mystic power, renewed the lives of all the demons.</p>
<p>Having been graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods began fighting the demons again, with renewed energy.</p>
<p>King Indra released his thunderbolt against Bali, and when Bali fell, his friend Jambhasura attacked Indra, who then cut off Jambhasura’s head with his thunderbolt.</p>
<p>When Narada Muni learned that Jambhasura had been killed, he informed Jambhasura’s relatives Namuci, Bala and Paka, who then went to the battlefield and attacked the demigods.</p>
<p>Indra, King of heaven, severed the heads of Bala and Paka and released the weapon known as kulisa, the thunderbolt, against Namuci’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The thunderbolt, however, returned unsuccessful, and thus Indra became morose.</p>
<p>At that time, an unseen voice came from the sky.</p>
<p>The voice declared, A dry or wet weapon cannot kill Namuci Hearing this voice, Indra began to think of how Namuci could be killed.</p>
<p>He then thought of foam, which is neither moist nor dry.</p>
<p>Using a weapon of foam, he was able to kill Namuci.</p>
<p>Thus Indra and the other demigods killed many demons.</p>
<p>Then, at the request of Lord Brahma, Narada went to the demigods and forbade them to kill the demons any longer.</p>
<p>All the demigods then returned to their abodes.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of Narada, whatever demons remained alive on the battlefield took Bali Maharaja to Asta Mountain.</p>
<p>There, by the touch of Sukracarya’s hand, Bali Maharaja regained his senses and consciousness, and those demons whose heads and bodies had not been completely lost were brought back to life by the mystic power of Sukracarya.</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly different planetary systems for different persons.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (14.18), urdhvam gacchanti sattva-sthah: persons in the mode of goodness can go to the upper planets.</p>
<p>Those in the modes of darkness and passion, however, are not allowed to enter the higher planets.</p>
<p>The word divam refers to the higher planetary system known as Svargaloka.</p>
<p>Indra, King of the higher planetary system, has the power to push down any conditioned soul attempting to go from the lower to the higher planets without proper qualifications.</p>
<p>The modern attempt to go to the moon is also an attempt by inferior men to go to Svargaloka by artificial, mechanical means.</p>
<p>This attempt cannot be successful.</p>
<p>From this statement of Indra it appears that anyone attempting to go to the higher planetary systems by mechanical means, which are here called maya, is condemned to go the hellish planets in the lower portion of the universe.</p>
<p>To go to the higher planetary system, one needs sufficient good qualities.</p>
<p>A sinful person situated in the mode of ignorance and addicted to drinking, meat-eating and illicit sex will never enter the higher planets by mechanical means.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja replied: All those present on this battlefield are certainly under the influence of eternal time, and according to their prescribed activities, they are destined to receive fame, victory, defeat and death, one after another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If one is victorious on the battlefield, he becomes famous; and if one is not victorious but is defeated, he may die.</p>
<p>Both victory and defeat are possible, whether on such a battlefield as this or on the battlefield of the struggle for existence.</p>
<p>Everything takes place according to the laws of nature (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Since everyone, without exception, is subject to the modes of material nature, whether one is victorious or defeated he is not independent, but is under the control of material nature.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, therefore, was very sensible.</p>
<p>He knew that the fighting was arranged by eternal time and that under time’s influence one must accept the results of one’s own activities.</p>
<p>Therefore even though Indra threatened that he would now kill Bali Maharaja by releasing the thunderbolt, Bali Maharaja was not at all afraid.</p>
<p>This is the spirit of a ksatriya: yuddhe capy apalayanam (Bg.18.43).</p>
<p>A ksatriya must be tolerant in all circumstances, especially on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Thus Bali Maharaja asserted that he was not at all afraid of death, although he was threatened by such a great personality as the King of heaven.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Seeing the movements of time, those who are cognizant of the real truth neither rejoice nor lament for different circumstances.</p>
<p>Therefore, because you are jubilant due to your victory, you should be considered not very learned.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja knew that Indra, King of heaven, was extremely powerful, certainly more powerful than he himself.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Bali Maharaja challenged Indra by saying that Indra was not a very learned person.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.11) Krsna rebuked Arjuna by saying:</p>
<p>asocyan anvasocas tvam</p>
<p>prajna-vadams ca bhasase</p>
<p>gatasun agatasums ca</p>
<p>nanusocanti panditah</p>
<p>While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief.</p>
<p>Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead Thus as Krsna challenged Arjuna by saying that he was not a pandita, or a learned person, Bali Maharaja also challenged King Indra and his associates.</p>
<p>In this material world, everything happens under the influence of time.</p>
<p>Consequently, for a learned person who sees how things are taking place, there is no question of being sorry or happy because of the waves of material nature.</p>
<p>After all, since we are being carried away by these waves, what is the meaning of being jubilant or morose? One who is fully conversant with the laws of nature is never jubilant or morose because of nature’s activities.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.14), Krsna advises that one be tolerant: tams titiksasva bharata.</p>
<p>Following this advice of Krsna’s, one should not be morose or unhappy because of circumstantial changes.</p>
<p>This is the symptom of a devotee.</p>
<p>A devotee carries out his duty in Krsna consciousness and is never unhappy in awkward circumstances.</p>
<p>He has full faith that in such circumstances, Krsna protects His devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore a devotee never deviates from his prescribed duty of devotional service.</p>
<p>The material qualities of jubilation and moroseness are present even in the demigods, who are very highly situated in the upper planetary system.</p>
<p>Therefore, when one is undisturbed by the so-called favorable and unfavorable circumstances of this material world, he should be understood to be brahma-bhuta, or self-realized.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.54), brahma-bhutah prasannatma na socati na kanksati: One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful When one is undisturbed by material circumstances, he should be understood to be on the transcendental stage, above the reactions of the three modes of material nature.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-10" id="summary-10">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#812-1" id="812-1">8.12</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Siva was bewildered upon seeing the beautiful Mohini-murti incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how he later came to his senses.</p>
<p>When Lord Siva heard about the pastimes performed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, in the form of an attractive woman, he mounted his bull and went to see the Lord.</p>
<p>Accompanied by his wife, Uma, and his servants, the bhuta-gana, or ghosts, he approached the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Lord Siva offered obeisances to the Supreme Lord as the all-pervading Lord, the universal form, the supreme controller of creation, the Supersoul, the resting place for everyone, and the completely independent cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Thus he offered prayers giving truthful descriptions of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then he expressed his desire.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is very kind to His devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore, to fulfill the desire of His devotee Lord Siva, He expanded His energy and manifested Himself in the form of a very beautiful and attractive woman.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this form, even Lord Siva was captivated.</p>
<p>Later, by the grace of the Lord, he controlled himself.</p>
<p>This demonstrates that by the power of the Lord’s external energy, everyone is captivated by the form of woman in this material world.</p>
<p>Again, however, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one can overcome the influence of maya.</p>
<p>This was evinced by Lord Siva, the topmost devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>First he was captivated, but later, by the grace of the Lord, he restrained himself.</p>
<p>It is declared in this connection that only a pure devotee can restrain himself from the attractive feature of maya.</p>
<p>Otherwise, once a living entity is trapped by the external feature of maya, he cannot overcome it.</p>
<p>After Lord Siva was graced by the Supreme Lord, he circumambulated the Lord along with his wife, Bhavani, and his companions, the ghosts.</p>
<p>Then he left for his own abode.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami concludes this chapter by describing the transcendental qualities of Uttamasloka, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by declaring that one can glorify the Lord by nine kinds of devotional service, beginning with sravanam kirtanam</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Mahadeva said: O chief demigod among the demigods, O all-pervading Lord, master of the universe, by Your energy You are transformed into the creation.</p>
<p>You are the root and efficient cause of everything.</p>
<p>You are not material.</p>
<p>Indeed, You are the Supersoul or supreme living force of everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, You are Paramesvara, the supreme controller of all controllers.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, resides within the material world as the sattva-guna-avatara.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is the tamo-guna-avatara, and Lord Brahma is the rajo-guna-avatara, but although Lord Visnu is among them, He is not in the same category.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is deva-deva, the chief of all the demigods.</p>
<p>Since Lord Siva is in this material world, the energy of the Supreme Lord, Visnu, includes Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is therefore called jagad-vyapi, the all-pervading Lord Lord Siva is sometimes called Mahesvara, and so people think that Lord Siva is everything.</p>
<p>But here Lord Siva addresses Lord Visnu as Jagad-isa, the master of the universe Lord Siva is sometimes called Visvesvara, but here he addresses Lord Visnu as Jagan-maya, indicating that even Visvesvara is under Lord Visnu’s control.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is the master of the spiritual world, yet He controls the material world also, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram (Bg.9.10)).</p>
<p>Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are also sometimes called isvara, but the supreme isvara is Lord Visnu, Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>As stated in Brahma-samhita, isvarah paramah krsnah: (Bs.5.1) the Supreme Lord is Krsna, Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Everything in existence works in proper order because of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham.</p>
<p>Even paramanu, the small atoms, work because of Lord Visnu’s presence within them.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic mantras, yato va imani bhutani jayante: everything is an emanation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.4):</p>
<p>bhumir apo ’nalo vayuh</p>
<p>kham mano buddhir eva ca</p>
<p>ahankara itiyam me</p>
<p>bhinna prakrtir astadha</p>
<p>Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together these eight comprise My separated material energies In other words, the ingredients of the cosmic manifestation also consist of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that because the ingredients come from Him, He is no longer complete purnasya purnam adaya purnam evavasisyate: Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance Thus the Lord is called avyaya, inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Unless we accept the Absolute Truth as acintya-bhedabheda, simultaneously one and different, we cannot have a clear conception of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The Lord is the root of everything.</p>
<p>Aham adir hi devanam: He is the original cause of all the devas, or demigods.</p>
<p>Aham sarvasya prabhavah: everything emanates from Him.</p>
<p>In all cases—nominative, objective, positive, negative and so on—whatever we may conceive of in this entire cosmic manifestation is in fact the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>For Him there are no such distinctions as this is mine, and this belongs to someone else because He is everything.</p>
<p>He is therefore called avyaya—changeless and inexhaustible.</p>
<p>Because the Supreme Lord is avyaya, He is the Absolute Truth, the fully spiritual Supreme Brahman.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Pure devotees or great saintly persons who desire to achieve the highest goal in life and who are completely free from all material desires for sense gratification engage constantly in the transcendental service of Your lotus feet.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One is in the material world when he thinks, I am this body, and everything with reference to my body is mine Ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair janasya moho ’yam aham mameti (SB 5.5.8).</p>
<p>This is the symptom of material life.</p>
<p>In the materialistic conception of life, one thinks, This is my house, this is my land, this is my family, this is my state and so on.</p>
<p>But those who are munayah, saintly persons following in the footsteps of Narada Muni, simply engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without any personal desire for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11).</p>
<p>Either in this life or in the next, the only concern of such saintly devotees is to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus they are also absolute because they have no other desires.</p>
<p>Being freed from the dualities of material desire, they are called sreyas-kamah.</p>
<p>In other words, they are not concerned with dharma (religiosity), artha (economic development), or kama (sense gratification).</p>
<p>The only concern of such devotees is moksa, liberation.</p>
<p>This moksa does not refer to becoming one with the Supreme like the Mayavadi philosophers.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu explained that real moksa means taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord clearly explained this fact while instructing Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya.</p>
<p>Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya wanted to correct the word mukti-pade in Srimad-Bhagavatam, but Caitanya Mahaprabhu informed him that there is no need to correct any word in Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>He explained that mukti-pade refers to the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, who offers mukti and is therefore called Mukunda.</p>
<p>A pure devotee is not concerned with material things.</p>
<p>He is not concerned with religiosity, economic development or sense gratification.</p>
<p>He is interested only in serving the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You are the Supreme Brahman, complete in everything.</p>
<p>Being completely spiritual, You are eternal, free from the material modes of nature, and full of transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>Indeed, for You there is no question of lamentation.</p>
<p>Since You are the supreme cause, the cause of all causes, nothing can exist without You.</p>
<p>Yet we are different from You in a relationship of cause and effect, for in one sense the cause and effect are different.</p>
<p>You are the original cause of creation, manifestation and annihilation, and You bestow benedictions upon all living entities.</p>
<p>Everyone depends upon You for the results of his activities, but You are always independent.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-gita (9.4):</p>
<p>maya tatam idam sarvam</p>

<p>mat-sthani sarva-bhutani</p>
<p>na caham tesv avasthitah</p>
<p>By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.</p>
<p>All beings are in Me, but I am not in them This explains the philosophy of simultaneous oneness and difference, known as acintya-bhedabheda.</p>
<p>Everything is the Supreme Brahman, the Personality of Godhead, yet the Supreme Person is differently situated from everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, because the Lord is differently situated from everything material, He is the Supreme Brahman, the supreme cause, the supreme controller.</p>
<p>Isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah (Bs.5.1).</p>
<p>The Lord is the supreme cause, and His form has nothing to do with the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>The devotee prays: As Your devotee is completely free from all desires, Your Lordship is also completely free from desires.</p>
<p>You are fully independent.</p>
<p>Although all living entities engage in Your service, You do not depend on the service of anyone.</p>
<p>Although this material world is created complete by You, everything depends on Your sanction.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: (Bg.15.15) remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness come from You.</p>
<p>Nothing can be done independently, yet You act independently of the service rendered by Your servants.</p>
<p>The living entities depend on Your mercy for liberation, but when You want to give them liberation, You do not depend on anyone else.</p>
<p>Indeed, by Your causeless mercy, You can give liberation to anyone.</p>
<p>Those who receive Your mercy are called krpa-siddha.</p>
<p>To reach the platform of perfection takes many, many lives (bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate (Bg.7.19)).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, even without undergoing severe austerities, one can attain perfection by Your mercy.</p>
<p>Devotional service should be unmotivated and free from impediments (ahaituky apratihata yayatma suprasidati).</p>
<p>This is the position of nirasisah, or freedom from expectations for results.</p>
<p>A pure devotee continuously offers transcendental loving service to You, but You may nonetheless offer mercy to anyone, without depending on his service</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear Lord, Your Lordship alone is the cause and the effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, although You appear to be two, You are the absolute one.</p>
<p>As there is no difference between the gold of a golden ornament and the gold in a mine, there is no difference between cause and effect; both of them are the same.</p>
<p>Only because of ignorance do people concoct differences and dualities.</p>
<p>You are free from material contamination, and since the entire cosmos is caused by You and cannot exist without You, it is an effect of Your transcendental qualities.</p>
<p>Thus the conception that Brahman is true and the world false cannot be maintained.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that the living entities are representations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s marginal potency whereas the various bodies accepted by the living entities are products of the material energy.</p>
<p>Thus the body is considered material, and the soul is considered spiritual.</p>
<p>The origin of them both, however, is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As the Lord explains in Bhagavad-gita (7.4–5):</p>
<p>bhumir apo ’nalo vayuh</p>
<p>kham mano buddhir eva ca</p>
<p>ahankara itiyam me</p>
<p>bhinna prakrtir astadha</p>
<p>apareyam itas tv anyam</p>
<p>prakrtim viddhi me param</p>
<p>jiva-bhutam maha-baho</p>
<p>yayedam dharyate jagat</p>
<p>Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together these eight comprise My separated material energies.</p>
<p>But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe Thus both matter and the living entities are manifestations of energy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Since the energy and the energetic are not different and since the material and marginal energies are both energies of the supreme energetic, the Supreme Lord, ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead is everything.</p>
<p>In this regard, the example may be given of gold that has not been molded and gold that has been molded into various ornaments.</p>
<p>A gold earring and the gold in a mine are different only as cause and effect; otherwise they are the same.</p>
<p>The Vedanta-sutra describes that Brahman is the cause of everything.</p>
<p>Janmady asya yatah (Bhag.1.1.1).</p>
<p>Everything is born of the Supreme Brahman, from which everything emanates as different energies.</p>
<p>None of these energies, therefore, should be considered false.</p>
<p>The Mayavadis’ differentiation between Brahman and maya is only due to ignorance.</p>
<p>Srimad Viraraghava Acarya, in his Bhagavata-candra-candrika, describes the Vaisnava philosophy as follows.</p>
<p>The cosmic manifestation is described as sat and asat, as cit and acit.</p>
<p>Matter is acit, and the living force is cit, but their origin is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in whom there is no difference between matter and spirit.</p>
<p>According to this conception, the cosmic manifestation, consisting of both matter and spirit, is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Idam hi visvam bhagavan ivetarah: This cosmic manifestation is also the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although it appears different from Him In Bhagavad-gita (9.4) the Lord says:</p>
<p>maya tatam idam sarvam</p>
<p>jagad avyakta-murtina</p>
<p>mat-sthani sarva-bhutani</p>
<p>na caham tesv avasthitah</p>
<p>By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded.</p>
<p>All beings are in Me, but I am not in them Thus although someone may say that the Supreme Person is different from the cosmic manifestation, actually He is not.</p>
<p>The Lord says, maya tatam idam sarvam: In My impersonal feature I am spread throughout the world Therefore, this world is not different from Him.</p>
<p>The difference is a difference in names.</p>
<p>For example, whether we speak of gold earrings, gold bangles or gold necklaces, ultimately they are all gold.</p>
<p>In a similar way, all the different manifestations of matter and spirit are ultimately one in the Supreme Personality of Godhead ekam evadvitiyam brahma.</p>
<p>This is the Vedic version (Chandogya Upanisad6.2.1).</p>
<p>There is oneness because everything emanates from the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>The example already given is that there is no difference between a golden earring and the gold mine as it is.</p>
<p>The Vaisesika philosophers, however, because of their Mayavada conception, create differences.</p>
<p>They say, brahma satyam jagan mithya: The Absolute Truth is real, and the cosmic manifestation is false But why should the jagat be considered mithya? The jagat is an emanation from Brahman.</p>
<p>Therefore the jagat is also truth.</p>
<p>Vaisnavas, therefore, do not consider the jagat to be mithya; rather, they regard everything as reality in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead anasaktasya visayan</p>
<p>yatharham upayunjatah</p>
<p>nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe</p>
<p>yuktam vairagyam ucyate</p>
<p>prapancikataya buddhya</p>
<p>hari-sambandhi-vastunah</p>
<p>mumuksubhih parityago</p>
<p>vairagyam phalgu kathyate</p>
<p>Things should be accepted for the Lord’s service and not for one’s personal sense gratification.</p>
<p>If one accepts something without attachment and accepts it because it is related to Krsna, one’s renunciation is called yuktam vairagyam.</p>
<p>Whatever is favorable for the rendering of service to the Lord should be accepted and should not be rejected as a material thing (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu1.2.255–256) The jagat should not be rejected as mithya.</p>
<p>It is truth, and the truth is realized when everything is engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>A flower accepted for one’s sense gratification is material, but when the same flower is offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead by a devotee, it is spiritual.</p>
<p>Food taken and cooked for oneself is material, but food cooked for the Supreme Lord is spiritual prasada.</p>
<p>This is a question of realization.</p>
<p>Actually, everything is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore everything is spiritual, but those who are not advanced in proper knowledge make distinctions because of the interactions of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Jiva Gosvami says that although the sun is the only light, the sunshine, which is exhibited in seven colors, and darkness, which is the absence of sunshine, are not different from the sun, for without the existence of the sun such differentiations cannot exist.</p>
<p>There may be varied nomenclature because of different conditions, but they are all the sun.</p>
<p>The puranas therefore say:</p>
<p>eka-desa-sthitasyagner</p>
<p>jyotsna vistarini yatha</p>
<p>parasya brahmanah saktis</p>
<p>tathedam akhilam jagat</p>
<p>Just as the illumination of a fire, which is situated in one place, is spread all over, the energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parabrahman, are spread all over this universe (Visnu Purana1.22.53) Materially, we can directly perceive the sunshine spreading itself according to different names and activities, but ultimately the sun is one.</p>
<p>Similarly, sarvam khalv idam brahma: everything is an expansion of the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Supreme Lord is everything, and He is one without differentiation.</p>
<p>There is no existence separate from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>O my Lord, I, who am considered to be the best of the demigods, and Lord Brahma and the great rsis, headed by Marici, are born of the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we are bewildered by Your illusory energy and cannot understand what this creation is.</p>
<p>Aside from us, what is to be said of others, like the demons and human beings, who are in the base modes of material nature (rajo-guna and tamo-guna)? How will they know You?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Factually speaking, even those who are situated in the material mode of goodness cannot understand the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of those who are situated in rajo-guna and tamo-guna, the base qualities of material nature? How can we even imagine the Supreme Personality of Godhead? There are so many philosophers trying to understand the Absolute Truth, but since they are situated in the base qualities of material nature and are addicted to so many bad habits, like drinking, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling, how can they conceive of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? For them it is impossible.</p>
<p>For the present day, the pancaratriki-vidhi as enunciated by Narada Muni is the only hope.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami, therefore, has quoted the following verse from the Brahma-yamala:</p>
<p>sruti-smrti-puranadi-</p>
<p>pancaratra-vidhim vina</p>
<p>aikantiki harer bhaktir</p>
<p>utpatayaiva kalpate</p>
<p>(BRS 1.2.101)</p>
<p>Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, puranas and Narada-pancaratra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu1.2.101)</p>
<p>Those who are very advanced in knowledge and are situated in the mode of goodness follow the Vedic instructions of the sruti and smrti and other religious scriptures, including the pancaratriki-vidhi.</p>
<p>Without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this way, one only creates a disturbance.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, so many gurus have sprung up, and because they do not refer to the sruti-smrti-puranadi-pancaratrika-vidhi (BRS 1.2.101), they are creating a great disturbance in the world in regard to understanding the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>However, those who follow the pancaratriki-vidhi under the guidance of a proper spiritual master can understand the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>It is said, pancaratrasya krtsnasya vakta tu bhagavan svayam: the pancaratra system is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just like Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Vasudeva-sarana vidur anjasaiva: the truth can be understood only by one who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Vasudeva bahunam janmanam ante</p>
<p>jnanavan mam prapadyate</p>
<p>vasudevah sarvam iti</p>
<p>sa mahatma sudurlabhah</p>
<p>After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is.</p>
<p>Such a great soul is very rare (Bg.7.19) Only those who have surrendered to the lotus feet of Vasudeva can understand the Absolute Truth vasudeve bhagavati</p>

<p>janayaty asu vairagyam</p>

<p>By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world (Bhag.1.2.7) Therefore, Vasudeva, Bhagavan Sri Krsna, personally teaches in Bhagavad-gita:</p>
<p>sarva-dharman parityajya</p>
<p>mam ekam saranam vraja</p>
<p>Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me (Bg.18.66)</p>
<p>bhaktya mam abhijanati</p>

<p>One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service (Bg.18.55) The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not properly understood even by Lord Siva or Lord Brahma, what to speak of others, but He can be understood by the process of bhakti-yoga mayy asakta-manah partha</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead knew that because Lord Siva is not an ordinary person, he cannot be bewildered even by the most beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Cupid himself tried to invoke Lord Siva’s lusty desires in the presence of Parvati, but Lord Siva was never agitated.</p>
<p>Rather, the blazing fire from Lord Siva’s eyes turned Cupid to ashes.</p>
<p>Therefore, Lord Visnu had to think twice about what kind of beautiful form would bewilder even Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Consequently He was smiling gravely, as stated in the previous verse (prahasya bhava-gambhiram).</p>
<p>A beautiful woman generally cannot induce Lord Siva to be lusty, but Lord Visnu was considering whether there was any form of woman who could enchant him.</p>

<p>O best of the demigods, I shall now show you My form that is very much appreciated by those who are lusty.</p>
<p>Since you want to see that form, I shall reveal it in your presence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Siva’s desiring to see Lord Visnu reveal the most attractive and beautiful form of a woman was certainly a joking affair.</p>
<p>Lord Siva knew that he could not be agitated by any so-called beautiful woman The Daityas may have been bewildered he thought, but since even the demigods could not be agitated, what to speak of me, who am the best of all the demigods However, because Lord Siva wanted to see Lord Visnu’s form as a woman, Lord Visnu decided to impersonate a woman and show him a form that would immediately put him in an ocean of lusty desires.</p>
<p>In effect, therefore, Lord Visnu told Lord Siva, I will show you My form as a woman, and if you become agitated by lusty desires, do not blame Me The attractive features of a woman are appreciated by those who are affected by lusty desires, but those who are above such desires, who are on the platform of Krsna consciousness, are very difficult to bewilder.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, by the supreme desire of the Personality of Godhead, everything can be done.</p>
<p>This was to be a test of whether Lord Siva could remain unagitated.</p>

<p>As he looked at the beautiful woman and She watched him, he forgot both himself and Uma, his most beautiful wife, as well as his associates nearby.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material bondage of this world is that a beautiful woman can captivate a handsome man and that a handsome man can captivate a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Such are the affairs that began when Lord Siva observed the beautiful girl playing with the ball.</p>
<p>In such activities, the influence of Cupid is very prominent.</p>
<p>As both parties move their eyebrows and glance at one another, their lusty desires increase more and more.</p>
<p>Such reciprocations of lusty desire took place between Lord Siva and the beautiful woman, even though Uma and Lord Siva’s associates were by Lord Siva’s side.</p>
<p>Such is the attraction between man and woman in the material world.</p>
<p>Lord Siva was supposed to be above all this attraction, but he was victimized by the captivating power of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Rsabhadeva thus explains the nature of lusty attraction:</p>
<p>pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam</p>
<p>tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim ahuh</p>
<p>ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair</p>
<p>janasya moho ’yam aham mameti</p>
<p>The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence.</p>
<p>On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth.</p>
<p>In this way one increases life’s illusions and thinks in terms of ‘I and mine.’ (Bhag.5.5.8) When a man and woman exchange feelings of lust, both of them are victimized, and thus they are bound to this material world in various ways.</p>

<p>Thus Lord Siva could understand his position and that of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has unlimited potencies.</p>
<p>Having reached this understanding, he was not at all surprised by the wonderful way Lord Visnu had acted upon him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as all-powerful because no one can excel Him in any activity.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (7.7) the Lord says, mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: O conqueror of wealth, there is no truth superior to Me No one can equal the Lord or be greater than Him, for He is the master of everyone.</p>
<p>As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi5.142), ekale isvara krsna, ara saba bhrtya.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the only master of everyone, including even Lord Siva, what to speak of others.</p>
<p>Lord Siva was already aware of the supreme power of Lord Visnu, but when he was actually put into bewilderment, he felt proud to have such an exalted master.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Seeing Lord Siva unagitated and unashamed, Lord Visnu (Madhusudana) was very pleased.</p>
<p>Thus He resumed His original form and spoke as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Lord Siva was aghast at the potency of Lord Visnu, he did not feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Rather, he was proud to be defeated by Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Nothing is hidden from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness Whatever happened had taken place under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore there was no cause to be sorry or ashamed.</p>
<p>Although Lord Siva is never defeated by anyone, when defeated by Lord Visnu he felt proud that he had such an exalted and powerful master.</p>

<p>Therefore, may all good fortune be upon you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Lord Siva is the best of the demigods, he is the best of all devotees (vaisnavanam yatha sambhuh).</p>
<p>His exemplary character was therefore praised by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who gave His benediction by saying, May all good fortune be upon you When a devotee becomes a little proud, the Supreme Lord sometimes exhibits His supreme power to dissipate the devotee’s misunderstanding.</p>
<p>After being amply harassed by Lord Visnu’s potency, Lord Siva resumed his normal, unagitated condition.</p>
<p>This is the position of a devotee.</p>
<p>A devotee should not be agitated under any circumstances, even in the worst reverses.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (6.22), yasmin sthito na duhkhena gurunapi vicalyate: because of his full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee is never agitated, even in the greatest trials.</p>
<p>This pridelessness is possible only for the first-class devotees, of whom Lord Sambhu is one.</p>

<p>My dear Lord Sambhu, who within this material world but you can surpass My illusory energy? People are generally attached to sense enjoyment and conquered by its influence.</p>
<p>Indeed, the influence of material nature is very difficult for them to surmount.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Of the three chief demigods—Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara—all but Visnu are under the influence of maya.</p>
<p>In Caitanya-caritamrta, they are described as mayi, which means under maya’s influence But even though Lord Siva associates with maya, he is not influenced.</p>
<p>The living entities are affected by maya, but although Lord Siva apparently associates with maya, he is not affected.</p>
<p>In other words, all living entities within this material world except for Lord Siva are swayed by maya.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is therefore neither visnu-tattva nor jiva-tattva.</p>
<p>He is between the two.</p>

<p>The material, external energy (maya), who cooperates with Me in creation and who is manifested in the three modes of nature, will not be able to bewilder you any longer.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Lord Siva was present, his wife, Durga, was also there.</p>
<p>Durga works in cooperation with the Supreme Personality of Godhead in creating the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.10), mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram: The material energy (prakrti) works under My direction, O son of Kunti, and is producing all moving and unmoving beings Prakrti is Durga srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The instruction of this narration concerning the churning of the milk ocean is clearly manifested by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Although He is equal to everyone, because of natural affection He favors His devotees.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):</p>
<p>samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu</p>

<p>mayi te tesu capy aham</p>
<p>I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone.</p>
<p>I am equal to all.</p>
<p>But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him This partiality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is natural.</p>
<p>A person cares for his children not because of partiality but in a reciprocation of love.</p>
<p>The children depend on the father’s affection, and the father affectionately maintains the children.</p>
<p>Similarly, because devotees do not know anything but the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord is always prepared to give protection to His devotees and fulfill their desires.</p>
<p>He therefore says, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes</p>

<p>This chapter describes the duties allotted to Manu by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>All the Manus, as well as their sons, the sages, the demigods and the Indras, act under the orders of various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>At the end of every catur-yuga, consisting of Satya-yuga, Dvapara-yuga, Treta-yuga and Kali-yuga, the sages, acting under the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, distribute the Vedic knowledge and thus reinstate eternal religious principles.</p>
<p>Manu’s duty is to reestablish the system of religion.</p>
<p>Manu’s sons execute Manu’s orders, and thus the entire universe is maintained by Manu and his descendants.</p>
<p>The Indras are various rulers of the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Assisted by the demigods, they rule the three worlds.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead also appears as incarnations in different yugas.</p>
<p>He appears as Sanaka, Sanatana, Yajnavalkya, Dattatreya and others, and thus He gives instructions in spiritual knowledge, prescribed duties, principles of mystic yoga, and so on.</p>
<p>As Marici and others, He creates progeny; as the king, He punishes the miscreants; and in the form of time, He annihilates the creation.</p>
<p>One may argue, If the all-powerful Supreme Personality of Godhead can do anything simply by His will, why has He arranged for so many personalities to manage How and why He does this cannot be understood by those who are under the clutches of maya.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At the end of every four yugas, the great saintly persons, upon seeing that the eternal occupational duties of mankind have been misused, reestablish the principles of religion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, the words dharmah and sanatanah are very important.</p>
<p>Sanatana means eternal and dharma means occupational duties From Satya-yuga to Kali-yuga, the principles of religion and occupational duty gradually deteriorate.</p>
<p>In Satya-yuga, the religious principles are observed in full, without deviation.</p>
<p>In Treta-yuga, however, these principles are somewhat neglected, and only three fourths of the religious duties continue.</p>
<p>In Dvapara-yuga only half of the religious principles continue, and in Kali-yuga only one fourth of the religious principles, which gradually disappear.</p>
<p>At the end of Kali-yuga, the principles of religion, or the occupational duties of humanity, are almost lost.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this Kali-yuga we have passed through only five thousand years, yet the decline of sanatana-dharma is very prominent.</p>
<p>The duty of saintly persons, therefore, is to take up seriously the cause of sanatana-dharma and try to reestablish it for the benefit of the entire human society.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement has been started according to this principle.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.3.51):</p>
<p>kaler dosa-nidhe rajan</p>
<p>asti hy eko mahan gunah</p>
<p>kirtanad eva krsnasya</p>
<p>mukta-sangah param vrajet</p>
<p>The entire Kali-yuga is full of faults.</p>
<p>It is like an unlimited ocean of faults.</p>
<p>But the Krsna consciousness movement is very authorized.</p>
<p>Therefore, following in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who five hundred years ago inaugurated the movement of sankirtana, krsna-kirtana, we are trying to introduce this movement, according to superior orders, all over the world.</p>
<p>Now, if the inaugurators of this movement strictly follow the regulative principles and spread this movement for the benefit of all human society, they will certainly usher in a new way of life by reestablishing sanatana-dharma, the eternal occupational duties of humanity.</p>
<p>The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve Krsna.</p>
<p>Jivera ‘svarupa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa.’ (Cc.Madhya 20.108).</p>
<p>This is the purport of sanatana-dharma.</p>
<p>Sanatana means nitya, or eternal and krsna-dasa means servant of Krsna The eternal occupational duty of the human being is to serve Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the sum and substance of the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, O King, the Manus, being fully engaged according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, directly reestablish the principles of occupational duty in its full four parts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Dharma, or occupational duty, can be established in its full four parts as explained in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.1) the Lord says:</p>
<p>imam vivasvate yogam</p>
<p>proktavan aham avyayam</p>
<p>vivasvan manave praha</p>
<p>manur iksvakave ’bravit</p>
<p>I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku This is the process of disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Following the same process, the Krsna consciousness movement is teaching the principles of Bhagavad-gita as it is, without deviation, all over the world.</p>
<p>If the fortunate people of this time accept the instructions of Lord Krsna, they will certainly be happy in Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s mission.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted everyone, at least in India, to become a preacher of this mission.</p>
<p>In other words, one should become a guru and preach the Lord’s instructions all over the world for the peace and prosperity of humanity.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To enjoy the results of sacrifices (yajnas), the rulers of the world, namely the sons and grandsons of Manu, discharge the orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead until the end of Manu’s reign.</p>
<p>The demigods also share the results of these sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.2):</p>
<p>evam parampara-praptam</p>
<p>imam rajarsayo viduh</p>
<p>This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way This parampara system extends from Manu to Iksvaku and from Iksvaku to his sons and grandsons.</p>
<p>The rulers of the world in the line of hierarchy execute the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the parampara system.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in peaceful life must participate in this parampara system and perform yajnas.</p>
<p>As Gaudiya Vaisnavas in the parampara system of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we must perform sankirtana-yajna all over the world (yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (SB 11.5.32)).</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this age of Kali, and He will be easily satisfied if the sankirtana movement is spread vigorously all over the world.</p>
<p>This will also make people happy without a doubt.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In every yuga, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, assumes the form of Siddhas such as Sanaka to preach transcendental knowledge, He assumes the form of great saintly persons such as Yajnavalkya to teach the way of karma, and He assumes the form of great yogis such as Dattatreya to teach the system of mystic yoga.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>For the benefit of all human society, not only does the Lord assume the form of Manu as an incarnation to rule the universe properly, but He also assumes the forms of a teacher, yogi, jnani and so on, for the benefit of human society.</p>
<p>The duty of human society, therefore, is to accept the path of action enunciated by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In the present age, the sum and substance of all Vedic knowledge is to be found in Bhagavad-gita, which is personally taught by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the same Supreme Godhead, assuming the form of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, expands the teachings of Bhagavad-gita all over the world.</p>
<p>In other words, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, is so kind and merciful to human society that He is always anxious to take the fallen souls back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#815-1" id="815-1">8.15</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Bali, after performing the Visvajit-yajna, received the benediction of a chariot and various kinds of paraphernalia for war, with which he attacked the King of heaven.</p>
<p>All the demigods, being afraid of him, left the heavenly planets and went away, following the instructions of their guru.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit wanted to understand how Lord Vamanadeva, on the plea of taking three paces of land from Bali Maharaja, took everything away from him and arrested him.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami responded to this inquiry with the following explanation.</p>
<p>In the fight between the demons and the demigods, as described in the Eleventh Chapter of this canto, Bali was defeated, and he died in the fight, but by the grace of Sukracarya he regained his life.</p>
<p>Thus he engaged himself in the service of Sukracarya, his spiritual master.</p>
<p>The descendants of Bhrgu, being pleased with him, engaged him in the Visvajit-yajna.</p>
<p>When this yajna was performed, from the fire of yajna came a chariot, horses, a flag, a bow, armor and two quivers of arrows.</p>
<p>Maharaja Prahlada, Bali Maharaja’s grandfather, gave Bali an eternal garland of flowers, and Sukracarya gave him a conchshell.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, after offering obeisances to Prahlada, the brahmanas and his spiritual master, Sukracarya, equipped himself to fight with Indra and went to Indrapuri with his soldiers.</p>
<p>Blowing his conchshell, he attacked the outskirts of Indra’s kingdom.</p>
<p>When Indra saw Bali Maharaja’s prowess, he went to his own spiritual master, Brhaspati, told him about Bali’s strength, and inquired about his duty.</p>
<p>Brhaspati informed the demigods that because Bali had been endowed with extraordinary power by the brahmanas, the demigods could not fight with him.</p>
<p>Their only hope was to gain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was no alternative.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, Brhaspati advised the demigods to leave the heavenly planets and keep themselves somewhere invisible.</p>
<p>The demigods followed his orders, and Bali Maharaja, along with his associates, gained the entire kingdom of Indra.</p>
<p>The descendants of Bhrgu Muni, being very affectionate to their disciple Bali Maharaja, engaged him in performing one hundred asvamedha-yajnas.</p>
<p>In this way, Bali enjoyed the opulences of the heavenly planets.</p>

<p>Bali Maharaja has now become extremely powerful because of the benedictions given him by the brahmanas, but when he later insults the brahmanas, he will be vanquished, along with his friends and assistants.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja and Indra were enemies.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, predicted that Bali Maharaja would be vanquished when he insulted the brahmanas by whose grace he had become so powerful, Bali Maharaja’s enemies were naturally anxious to know when that opportune moment would come.</p>
<p>To pacify King Indra, Brhaspati assured him that the time would certainly come, for Brhaspati could see that in the future Bali Maharaja would defy the orders of Sukracarya in order to pacify Lord Visnu, Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Of course, to advance in Krsna consciousness, one can take all risks.</p>
<p>To please Vamanadeva, Bali Maharaja risked defying the orders of his spiritual master, Sukracarya.</p>
<p>Because of this, he would lose all his property, yet because of devotional service to the Lord, he would get more than he expected, and in the future, in the eighth manvantara, he would occupy the throne of Indra again.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#816-1" id="816-1">8.16</a></h3>
<p>As described in this chapter, because Aditi, the mother of the demigods, was very afflicted, her husband, Kasyapa Muni, told her how to observe vows in austerities for the benefit of her sons.</p>
<p>Since the demigods were not visible in the heavenly kingdom, their mother, Aditi, because of separation from them, was very much aggrieved.</p>
<p>One day after many, many years, the great sage Kasyapa emerged from a trance of meditation and returned to his asrama.</p>
<p>He saw that the asrama was no longer beautiful and that his wife was very morose.</p>
<p>Everywhere in the asrama, he saw signs of lamentation.</p>
<p>The great sage therefore inquired from his wife about the well-being of the asrama and asked her why she looked so morose.</p>
<p>After Aditi informed Kasyapa Muni about the asrama’s well-being, she told him that she was lamenting for the absence of her sons.</p>
<p>She then requested him to tell her how her sons could return and reoccupy their positions.</p>
<p>She wanted all good fortune for her sons.</p>
<p>Moved by Aditi’s request, Kasyapa Muni instructed her in the philosophy of self-realization, the difference between matter and spirit, and how to be unaffected by material loss.</p>
<p>But when he saw that Aditi was not satisfied even after he had given these instructions, he advised her to worship Vasudeva, Janardana.</p>
<p>He assured her that only Lord Vasudeva could satisfy her and fulfill all her desires.</p>
<p>When Aditi then expressed her desire to worship Lord Vasudeva, Prajapati Kasyapa told her about a process of worship known as payo-vrata, which is executed in twelve days.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma had instructed him how to satisfy Lord Krsna by this process, and thus he advised his wife to observe this vow and its regulative principles.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my wife, who are very much attached to household life, if the principles of religion, economic development and satisfaction of the senses are properly followed in household life, one’s activities are as good as those of a transcendentalist.</p>
<p>I wonder whether there have been any discrepancies in following these principles.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, Aditi has been addressed by her husband, Kasyapa Muni, as grha-medhini, which means one who is satisfied in household life for sense gratification Generally, those who are in household life pursue sense gratification in the field of activities performed for material results.</p>
<p>Such grhamedhis have only one aim in life—sense gratification.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham: (SB 7.9.45) the householder’s life is based on sense gratification, and therefore the happiness derived from it is very meager.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Vedic process is so comprehensive that even in householder life one can adjust his activities according to the regulative principles of dharma, artha, kama and moksa.</p>
<p>One’s aim should be to achieve liberation, but because one cannot at once give up sense gratification, in the sastras there are injunctions prescribing how to follow the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.9), dharmasya hy apavargyasya nartho ’rthayopakalpate: All occupational engagements are certainly meant for ultimate liberation.</p>
<p>They should never be performed for material gain Those who are in household life should not think that religion is meant to improve the process of the householder’s sense gratification.</p>
<p>Household life is also meant for advancement in spiritual understanding, by which one can ultimately gain liberation from the material clutches.</p>
<p>One should remain in household life with the aim of understanding the ultimate goal of life (tattva jijnasa).</p>
<p>Then household life is as good as the life of a yogi.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni therefore inquired from his wife whether the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification were being properly followed in terms of the sastric injunctions.</p>
<p>As soon as one deviates from the injunctions of the sastra, the purpose of household life is immediately lost in confusion.</p>

<p>It is the duty of a householder to receive guests, even if a guest be an enemy.</p>
<p>When a guest comes to one’s home, one should properly receive him by standing up and offering him a seat.</p>
<p>It is enjoined, grhe satrum api praptam visvastam akutobhayam: if even an enemy comes to one’s home, one should receive him in such a way that the guest will forget that his host is an enemy.</p>
<p>According to one’s position, one should properly receive anyone who comes to one’s home.</p>
<p>At least a seat and a glass of water should be offered, so that the guest will not be displeased.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni inquired from Aditi whether disrespect had been shown to such guests, or atithis.</p>
<p>The word atithi refers to one who comes without an invitation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By worshiping the fire and the brahmanas, a householder can achieve the desired goal of residing in the higher planets, for the sacrificial fire and the brahmanas are to be considered the mouth of Lord Visnu, who is the Supersoul of all the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic system, a fire sacrifice is held in order to offer oblations of ghee, grains, fruits, flowers and so on, so that Lord Visnu may eat and be satisfied.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.26):</p>
<p>patram puspam phalam toyam</p>
<p>yo me bhaktya prayacchati</p>
<p>tad aham bhakty-upahrtam</p>
<p>asnami prayatatmanah</p>
<p>If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it Therefore, all these items may be offered in the sacrificial fire, and Lord Visnu will be satisfied.</p>
<p>Similarly, brahmana-bhojana, feeding of the brahmanas, is also recommended, for when the brahmanas eat sumptuous remnants of food after yajna, this is another way that Lord Visnu Himself eats.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic principles recommend that in every festival or ceremony one offer oblations to the fire and give sumptuous food for the brahmanas to eat.</p>
<p>By such activities, a householder may be elevated to the heavenly planets and similar places in the higher planetary systems.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O son of Marici, because you are a great personality you are equal toward all the demons and demigods, who are born either from your body or from your mind and who possess one or another of the three qualities—sattva-guna, rajo-guna or tamo-guna.</p>
<p>But although the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, is equal toward all living entities, He is especially favorable to the devotees.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (9.29) the Lord says:</p>
<p>samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu</p>
<p>na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah</p>
<p>ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya</p>
<p>mayi te tesu capy aham</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is equal toward everyone, He is especially inclined toward those who engage in His devotional service.</p>
<p>The Lord says, kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: My dear son of Kunti, please declare that My devotee will never be vanquished Elsewhere, Krsna also says:</p>
<p>ye yatha mam prapadyante</p>
<p>tams tathaiva bhajamy aham</p>
<p>mama vartmanuvartante</p>
<p>manusyah partha sarvasah</p>
<p>(Bg.4.11)</p>
<p>Actually, everyone is trying to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in various ways, but according to their methods of approach, the Supreme Lord endows them with different benedictions.</p>
<p>Thus Aditi appealed to her husband by saying that since even the supreme controller favors His devotees and since Indra, Kasyapa’s devoted son, was in difficulty, Kasyapa should bestow his favor upon Indra.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni continued: What is this material body, made of five elements? It is different from the spirit soul.</p>
<p>Indeed, the spirit soul is completely different from the material elements from which the body is made.</p>
<p>But because of bodily attachment, one is regarded as a husband or son.</p>
<p>These illusory relationships are caused by misunderstanding.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The spirit soul (atma or jiva) is certainly different from the body, which is a combination of five material elements.</p>
<p>This is a simple fact, but it is not understood unless one is spiritually educated.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni met his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, but the same misconception extends throughout the entire universe and is also here on earth.</p>
<p>There are different grades of living entities, but all of them are more or less under the impression of the bodily conception of life.</p>
<p>In other words, all living entities in this material world are more or less devoid of spiritual education.</p>
<p>The Vedic civilization, however, is based on spiritual education, and spiritual education is the special basis on which Bhagavad-gita was spoken to Arjuna.</p>
<p>In the beginning of Bhagavad-gita, Krsna instructed Arjuna to understand that the spirit soul is different from the body dehino ’smin yatha dehe</p>
<p>kaumaram yauvanam jara</p>
<p>tatha dehantara-praptir</p>
<p>dhiras tatra na muhyati</p>
<p>As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change (Bg.2.13) Unfortunately, this spiritual education is completely absent from modern human civilization.</p>
<p>No one understands his real self-interest, which lies with the spirit soul, not with the material body.</p>
<p>Education means spiritual education.</p>
<p>To work hard in the bodily conception of life, without spiritual education, is to live like an animal.</p>
<p>Nayam deho deha-bhajam nr-loke kastan kaman arhate vid-bhujam ye (Bhag.5.5.1).</p>
<p>People are working so hard simply for bodily comforts, without education regarding the spirit soul.</p>
<p>Thus they are living in a very risky civilization, for it is a fact that the spirit soul has to transmigrate from one body to another (tatha dehantara-praptih).</p>
<p>Without spiritual education, people are kept in dark ignorance and do not know what will happen to them after the annihilation of the present body.</p>
<p>They are working blindly, and blind leaders are directing them.</p>
<p>Andha yathandhair upaniyamanas te ’pisa-tantryam uru-damni baddhah (Bhag.7.5.31).</p>
<p>A foolish person does not know that he is completely under the bondage of material nature and that after death material nature will impose upon him a certain type of body, which he will have to accept.</p>
<p>He does not know that although in his present body he may be a very important man, he may next get the body of an animal or tree because of his ignorant activities in the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is trying to give the true light of spiritual existence to all living entities.</p>
<p>This movement is not very difficult to understand, and people must take advantage of it, for it will save them from the risky life of irresponsibility.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear Aditi, engage in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the master of everything, who can subdue everyone’s enemies, and who sits within everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>Only that Supreme Person—Krsna, or Vasudeva—can bestow all auspicious benedictions upon everyone, for He is the spiritual master of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>With these words, Kasyapa Muni tried to pacify his wife.</p>
<p>Aditi made her appeal to her material husband.</p>
<p>Of course, that is nice, but actually a material relative cannot do anything good for anyone.</p>
<p>If anything good can be done, it is done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kasyapa Muni advised his wife, Aditi, to begin worshiping Lord Vasudeva, who is situated in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>He is the friend of everyone and is known as Janardana because He can kill all enemies.</p>
<p>There are three modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—and above material nature, transcendental to material nature, is another existence, which is called suddha-sattva.</p>
<p>In the material world, the mode of goodness is considered the best, but because of material contamination, even the mode of goodness is sometimes overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>But when one transcends the competition between these modes and engages himself in devotional service, he rises above the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>In that transcendental position, one is situated in pure consciousness.</p>
<p>Sattvam visuddham vasudeva-sabditam (Bhag.4.3.23).</p>
<p>Above material nature is the position called vasudeva, or freedom from material contamination.</p>
<p>Only in that position can one perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Thus the vasudeva condition fulfills a spiritual necessity.</p>
<p>Vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah (Bg.7.19).</p>
<p>When one realizes Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes most exalted.</p>
<p>Paramatma (Vasudeva) is situated in everyone’s heart, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The Lord says:</p>
<p>tesam satata-yuktanam</p>
<p>bhajatam priti-purvakam</p>
<p>dadami buddhi-yogam tam</p>
<p>yena mam upayanti te</p>
<p>To those who are constantly devoted and who worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me (Bg.10.10)</p>
<p>isvarah sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna (Bg.18.61)</p>
<p>bhoktaram yajna-tapasam</p>
<p>sarva-loka-mahesvaram</p>
<p>suhrdam sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>jnatva mam santim rcchati</p>
<p>The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries (Bg.5.29)</p>
<p>Whenever one is perplexed, let him take shelter of the lotus feet of Vasudeva, Krsna, who will give the devotee intelligence to help him surpass all difficulties and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of Vasudeva, Krsna, so that all her problems would be very easily solved.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni was an ideal spiritual master.</p>
<p>He was not so foolish that he would present himself as an exalted personality, as good as God.</p>
<p>He was actually a bona fide guru because he advised his wife to seek shelter at the lotus feet of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>One who trains his subordinate or disciple to worship Vasudeva is the truly bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>The word jagad-gurum is very important in this regard.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni did not falsely declare himself to be jagad-guru, although he actually was jagad-guru because he advocated the cause of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Actually, Vasudeva is jagad-guru, as clearly stated here (vasudevam jagad-gurum).</p>
<p>One who teaches the instructions of Vasudeva, Bhagavad-gita, is as good as vasudevam jagad-gurum.</p>
<p>But when one who does not teach this instruction—as it is—declares himself jagad-guru, he simply cheats the public.</p>
<p>Krsna is jagad-guru, and one who teaches the instruction of Krsna as it is, on behalf of Krsna, may be accepted as jagad-guru.</p>
<p>One who manufactures his own theories cannot be accepted; he becomes jagad-guru falsely.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is very merciful to the poor, will fulfill all of your desires, for devotional service unto Him is infallible.</p>
<p>Any method other than devotional service is useless.</p>
<p>That is my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are three kinds of men, who are called akama, moksa-kama and sarva-kama.</p>
<p>One who tries to get liberation from this material world is called moksa-kama, one who wants to enjoy this material world to its fullest extent is called sarva-kama, and one who has fulfilled all his desires and has no further material desires is called akama.</p>
<p>A bhakta has no desire.</p>
<p>Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam (Cc.Madhya 19.170).</p>
<p>He is purified and free from material desires.</p>
<p>The moksa-kami wants to achieve liberation by merging into the existence of the Supreme Brahman, and because of this desire to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is not yet pure.</p>
<p>And since those who want liberation are impure, what to speak of the karmis, who have so many desires to fulfill? Nonetheless, the sastra says:</p>
<p>akamah sarva-kamo va</p>
<p>moksa-kama udara-dhih</p>
<p>tivrena bhakti-yogena</p>
<p>yajeta purusam param</p>
<p>Whether one desires everything or nothing or desires to merge into the existence of the Lord, he is intelligent only if he worships Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by rendering transcendental loving service (Bhag.2.3.10) Kasyapa Muni saw that his wife, Aditi, had some material desires for the welfare of her sons, but still he advised her to render devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In other words, everyone, regardless of whether he is a karmi, jnani, yogi or bhakta, should invariably take shelter of the lotus feet of Vasudeva and render transcendental loving service unto Him so that all his desires will be duly fulfilled.</p>
<p>Krsna is dina-anukampana: He is very merciful to everyone.</p>
<p>Therefore if one wants to fulfill his material desires, Krsna helps him.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes if a devotee is very sincere, the Lord, as a special favor to him, refuses to fulfill his material desires and directly blesses him with pure, unalloyed devotional service.</p>
<p>It is said in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya22.38–39):</p>
<p>krsna kahe,——‘ama bhaje, mage visaya-sukha</p>
<p>amrta chadi’ visa mage,——ei bada murkha</p>
<p>ami——vijna, ei murkhe ‘visaya’ kene diba</p>
<p>sva-caranamrta diya ‘visaya’ bhulaiba</p>
<p>Krsna says, ‘If one engages in My transcendental loving service but at the same time wants the opulence of material enjoyment, he is very, very foolish.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is just like a person who gives up ambrosia to drink poison.</p>
<p>Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment.’ If a devotee maintains some material desire and at the same time very sincerely desires to engage at the lotus feet of Krsna, Krsna may directly give him unalloyed devotional service and take away all his material desires and possessions.</p>
<p>This is the Lord’s special favor to devotees.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if one takes to Krsna’s devotional service but still has material desires to fulfill, he may become free from all material desires, as Dhruva Maharaja did, but this may take some time.</p>
<p>However, if a very sincere devotee wants only Krsna’s lotus feet, Krsna directly gives him the position of suddha-bhakti, unalloyed devotional service.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, Man proposes, God disposes Thus a person may desire many things, but unless these desires are fulfilled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Fulfillment of desire is called satya-sankalpa.</p>
<p>Here the word satya-sankalpa is very important.</p>
<p>Aditi placed herself at the mercy of her husband so that he would give her directions by which to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that all her desires would be fulfilled.</p>
<p>A disciple must first decide that he should worship the Supreme Lord, and then the spiritual master will give the disciple correct directions.</p>
<p>One cannot dictate to the spiritual master, just as a patient cannot demand that his physician prescribe a certain type of medicine.</p>
<p>Here is the beginning of worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>Sometimes less intelligent men ask whether one has to approach a guru to be instructed in devotional service for spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>The answer is given here—indeed, not only here, but also in Bhagavad-gita, where Arjuna accepted Krsna as his guru (sisyas te ’ham sadhi mam tvam prapannam).</p>
<p>The Vedas also instruct, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: (MU1.2.12) one must accept a guru for proper direction if one is seriously inclined toward advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>The Lord says that one must worship the acarya, who is the representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (acaryam mam vijaniyat).</p>
<p>One should definitely understand this.</p>
<p>In Caitanya-caritamrta it is said that the guru is the manifestation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to all the evidence given by the sastra and by the practical behavior of devotees, one must accept a guru.</p>

<p>Now I shall explain to you the same process Lord Brahma instructed me, by which Kesava, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the process of devotional service is further explained.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni wanted to instruct Aditi in the same process recommended to him by Brahma for satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is valuable.</p>
<p>The guru does not manufacture a new process to instruct the disciple.</p>
<p>The disciple receives from the guru an authorized process received by the guru from his guru.</p>
<p>This is called the system of disciplic succession (evam parampara-praptam imam rajarsayo viduh (Bg.4.2)).</p>
<p>This is the bona fide Vedic system of receiving the process of devotional service, by which the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pleased.</p>
<p>Therefore, to approach a bona fide guru, or spiritual master, is essential.</p>
<p>The bona fide spiritual master is he who has received the mercy of his guru, who in turn is bona fide because he has received the mercy of his guru.</p>
<p>This is called the parampara system.</p>
<p>Unless one follows this parampara system, the mantra one receives will be chanted for no purpose.</p>
<p>Nowadays there are so many rascal gurus who manufacture their mantras as a process for material advancement, not spiritual advancement.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>phalgunasya—of the month of Phalguna (February and March); amale—during the bright; pakse—fortnight; dvadasa-aham—for twelve days, ending with Dvadasi, the day after Ekadasi; payah-vratam—accepting the vow of taking only milk; arcayet—one should worship; aravinda-aksam—the lotus-eyed Supreme Personality of Godhead; bhaktya—with devotion; paramaya—unalloyed; anvitah—surcharged.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the bright fortnight of the month of Phalguna (February and March), for twelve days ending with Dvadasi, one should observe the vow of subsisting only on milk and should worship the lotus-eyed Supreme Personality of Godhead with all devotion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Worshiping the Supreme Lord Visnu with devotion means following arcana-marga sravanam kirtanam visnoh</p>
<p>smaranam pada-sevanam</p>
<p>arcanam vandanam dasyam</p>
<p>sakhyam atma-nivedanam</p>
<p>(SB 7.5.23)</p>
<p>One should install the Deity of Lord Visnu or Krsna and worship Him nicely by dressing Him, decorating Him with flower garlands, and offering Him all kinds of fruits, flowers and cooked food, nicely prepared with ghee, sugar and grains.</p>
<p>One should also offer a flame, incense and so on, while ringing a bell, as prescribed.</p>
<p>This is called worship of the Lord.</p>
<p>Here it is recommended that one observe the vow of subsisting only by drinking milk.</p>
<p>This is called payo-vrata.</p>
<p>As we generally perform devotional service on Ekadasi by not eating grains, it is generally recommended that on Dvadasi one not consume anything but milk payo-vrata and arcana devotional service to the Supreme Lord should be performed with a pure devotional attitude (bhaktya).</p>
<p>Without bhakti, one cannot worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah (Bg.18.55).</p>
<p>If one wants to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead and be directly connected with Him, knowing what He wants to eat and how He is satisfied, one must take to the process of bhakti.</p>
<p>As recommended here also, bhaktya paramayanvitah: one should be surcharged with unalloyed devotional service.</p>

<p>In the Vedic system, prasada is distributed, as recommended here, without discrimination as to who may take the prasada.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one be a brahmana, sudra, vaisya, ksatriya, or even the lowest of men, a candala, he should be welcome to accept prasada.</p>

<p>Narayana is situated in everyone’s heart, but this does not mean Narayana is a candala or poor man.</p>
<p>The Mayavada philosophy of accepting a poor man as Narayana is the most envious and atheistic movement in Vedic culture.</p>
<p>This mentality should be completely given up.</p>
<p>Everyone should be given the opportunity to take prasada, but this does not mean that everyone has the right to become Narayana.</p>

<p>O gentle lady, it is the essence of all austerities, and it is the process of giving charity and pleasing the supreme controller.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Aradhananam sarvesam visnor aradhanam param.</p>
<p>This is a statement made by Lord Siva to Parvati.</p>
<p>Worshiping Lord Visnu is the supreme process of worship.</p>
<p>And how Lord Visnu is worshiped in this payo-vrata ceremony has now been fully described.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of life is to please Lord Visnu by varnasrama-dharma.</p>
<p>The Vedic principles of four varnas and four asramas are meant for worship of Visnu (visnur aradhyate pumsam nanyat tat-tosa-karanam).</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is also visnu-aradhanam, or worship of Lord Visnu, according to the age.</p>
<p>The payo-vrata method of visnu-aradhanam was enunciated long, long ago by Kasyapa Muni to his wife, Aditi, in the heavenly planets, and the same process is bona fide on earth even now.</p>
<p>Especially for this age of Kali, the process accepted by the Krsna consciousness movement is to open hundreds and thousands of Visnu temples (temples of Radha-Krsna, Jagannatha, Balarama, Sita-Rama, Gaura-Nitai and so on).</p>
<p>Performing prescribed worship in such temples of Visnu and thus worshiping the Lord is as good as performing the payo-vrata ceremony recommended here.</p>
<p>The payo-vrata ceremony is performed from the first to the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of the moon, but in our Krsna consciousness movement Lord Visnu is worshiped in every temple according to a schedule of twenty-four hours of engagement in performing kirtana, chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, offering palatable food to Lord Visnu and distributing this food to Vaisnavas and others.</p>
<p>These are authorized activities, and if the members of the Krsna consciousness movement stick to these principles, they will achieve the same result one gains by observing the payo-vrata ceremony.</p>
<p>Thus the essence of all auspicious activities, such as performing yajna, giving in charity, observing vratas, and undergoing austerities, is included in the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>The members of this movement should immediately and sincerely follow the processes already recommended.</p>
<p>Of course, sacrifice is meant to please Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: (SB 11.5.32) in Kali-yuga, those who are intelligent perform the sankirtana-yajna.</p>
<p>One should follow this process conscientiously.</p>

<p>srama eva hi kevalam</p>
<p>The occupational activities a man performs according to his own position are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Personality of Godhead (Bhag.1.2.8) If one is not interested in satisfying Lord Visnu, Vasudeva, all his so-called auspicious activities are fruitless.</p>
<p>Moghasa mogha-karmano mogha-jnana vicetasah: (Bg.9.12) because he is bewildered, he is baffled in his hopes, baffled in his activities, and baffled in his knowledge.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti remarks, napumsakam anapumsakenety-adinaikatvam.</p>
<p>One cannot equate the potent and the impotent.</p>
<p>Among modern Mayavadis it has become fashionable to say that whatever one does or whatever path one follows is all right.</p>
<p>But these are all foolish statements.</p>
<p>Here it is forcefully affirmed that this is the only method for success in life.</p>
<p>Isvara-tarpanam vina sarvam eva viphalam.</p>
<p>Unless Lord Visnu is satisfied, all of one’s pious activities, ritualistic ceremonies and yajnas are simply for show and have no value.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, foolish people do not know the secret of success.</p>
<p>Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum (SB 7.5.31).</p>
<p>They do not know that real self-interest ends in pleasing Lord Visnu.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#817-1" id="817-1">8.17</a></h3>
<p>As explained in this chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being very pleased by the payo-vrata ceremony performed by Aditi, appeared before her in full opulence.</p>
<p>At her request, the Lord agreed to become her son.</p>
<p>After Aditi performed the payo-vrata ceremony for twelve continuous days, the Lord, who was certainly very pleased with her, appeared before her with four hands and dressed in yellow garments.</p>
<p>As soon as Aditi saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead present before her, she immediately got up, and with great ecstatic love for the Lord she fell to the ground to offer respectful obeisances.</p>
<p>Aditi’s throat was choked because of ecstatic feelings, and her entire body trembled with devotion.</p>
<p>Although she wanted to offer suitable prayers to the Lord, she could not do anything, and thus she remained silent for some time.</p>
<p>Then, feeling solace, observing the beauty of the Lord, she offered her prayers.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul of all living entities, was very pleased with her, and He agreed to become her son by incarnating as a plenary expansion.</p>
<p>He was already pleased by Kasyapa Muni’s austerities, and thus He agreed to become their son and maintain the demigods.</p>
<p>After giving His word of honor to this effect, the Lord disappeared.</p>
<p>Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Aditi engaged in the service of Kasyapa Muni, who could see by samadhi that the Lord was within him and who thus placed his semen in the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma, who is known as Hiranyagarbha, understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead had entered Aditi’s womb.</p>
<p>Thus he offered prayers to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of those who observe vows and austerities, and it is He who bestows benedictions upon them.</p>
<p>He is worshipable for the devotee throughout the devotee’s life, for He never breaks His promises.</p>
<p>As He says in Bhagavad-gita (9.31), kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati: O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes The Lord is addressed here as acyuta, the infallible, because He takes care of His devotees.</p>
<p>Anyone inimical to the devotees is certainly vanquished by the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is the source of the Ganges water, and therefore He is addressed here as tirtha-pada, indicating that all the holy places are at His lotus feet, or that whatever He touches with His foot becomes a holy place.Bhagavad-gita, for example, begins with the words dharma-ksetre kuru-ksetre (Bg.1.1).</p>
<p>Because the Lord was present on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, it became a dharma-ksetra, a place of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Therefore the Pandavas, who were extremely religious, were assured of victory.</p>
<p>Any place where the Supreme Personality of Godhead displays His pastimes, such as Vrndavana or Dvaraka, becomes a holy place.</p>
<p>The chanting of the holy name of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—is pleasing to the ear, and it expands good fortune to the audience who hears it chanted.</p>
<p>Owing to the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Aditi was fully assured that the troublesome condition created for her by the demons would now be ended.</p>

<p>Anyone trying to become fully Krsna conscious must know the Lord’s glories as far as they are possible to understand.</p>
<p>Here Aditi hints at these glories.</p>
<p>The universe is nothing but the external potency of the Lord.</p>

<p>Whatever we see in this universe is but an expansion of the potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just as the sunshine and heat all over the universe are expansions of the sun.</p>
<p>When one surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he surpasses the influence of the illusory energy, for the Supreme Lord, being fully wise and being situated in the heart of everyone, especially in the heart of the devotee, gives one intelligence by which one is sure never to fall into illusion.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, as the wind promotes friction between two pieces of wood and thus gives rise to fire, Kasyapa Muni, whose transcendental position was fully absorbed in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, transferred his potency into the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A forest fire begins when two pieces of wood rub against one another, being agitated by the wind.</p>
<p>Actually, however, fire belongs neither to the wood nor to the wind; it is always different from both.</p>
<p>Similarly, here it is to be understood that the union of Kasyapa Muni and Aditi was not like the sexual intercourse of ordinary human beings.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has nothing to do with the human secretions of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>He is always completely aloof from such material combinations.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu: I am equal toward all living entities Nonetheless, to protect the devotees and kill the demons, who were a disturbing element, the Lord entered the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>Therefore this is a transcendental pastime of the Lord.</p>
<p>This should not be misunderstood.</p>
<p>One should not think that the Lord became the son of Aditi the way an ordinary child is born because of sexual intercourse between man and woman.</p>
<p>Here it may also be appropriate to explain, in these days of controversy, the origin of life.</p>
<p>The life force of the living entity—the soul—is different from the ovum and semen of the human being.</p>
<p>Although the conditioned soul has nothing to do with the reproductive cells of man and woman, he is placed into the proper situation because of his work (karmana daiva-netrena).</p>
<p>Life is not, however, a product of two secretions, but is independent of all material elements.</p>
<p>As fully described in Bhagavad-gita, the living entity is not subject to any material reactions.</p>
<p>He can neither be burnt by fire, cut by sharp weapons, moistened by water, nor dried by the air.</p>
<p>He is completely different from the physical elements, but by a superior arrangement he is put into these material elements.</p>
<p>He is always aloof from material contact (asango hy ayam purusah) but because he is placed in a material condition, he suffers the reactions of the material modes of nature purusah prakrti-stho hi</p>
<p>bhunkte prakrtijan gunan</p>
<p>karanam guna-sango ’sya</p>
<p>sad-asad-yoni-janmasu</p>
<p>The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>This is due to his association with that material nature.</p>
<p>Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species (Bg.13.22) Although the living entity is aloof from the material elements, he is put into material conditions, and thus he must suffer the reactions of material activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Lord Brahma understood that the Supreme Personality of Godhead was now within the womb of Aditi, he began to offer prayers to the Lord by reciting transcendental names.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead exists everywhere (andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham).</p>
<p>Therefore when one chants His transcendental names—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—the Supreme Personality of Godhead is automatically pleased by such sankirtana.</p>
<p>It is not that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is absent; He is present there.</p>
<p>And when a devotee utters the transcendental name, it is not a material sound.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is naturally pleased.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-16" id="summary-16">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#818-1" id="818-1">8.18</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Vamanadeva appeared and how He went to the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Bali, who received Him well and fulfilled His desire by offering Him benedictions.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva appeared in this world from the womb of Aditi completely equipped with conchshell, disc, club and lotus.</p>
<p>His bodily hue was blackish, and He was dressed in yellow garments.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu appeared at an auspicious moment on Sravana-dvadasi when the Abhijit star had arisen.</p>
<p>At that time, in all the three worlds (including the higher planetary system, outer space and this earth), all the demigods, the cows, the brahmanas and even the seasons were happy because of God’s appearance.</p>
<p>Therefore this auspicious day is called Vijaya.</p>
<p>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has a sac-cid-ananda body, appeared as the son of Kasyapa and Aditi, both of His parents were very astonished.</p>
<p>After His appearance, the Lord assumed the form of a dwarf (Vamana).</p>
<p>All the great sages expressed their jubilation, and with Kasyapa Muni before them they performed the birthday ceremony of Lord Vamana.</p>
<p>At the time of Lord Vamanadeva’s sacred thread ceremony, He was honored by the sun-god, Brhaspati, the goddess presiding over the planet earth, the deity of the heavenly planets, His mother, Lord Brahma, Kuvera, the seven rsis and others.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva then visited the sacrificial arena on the northern side of the Narmada River, at the field known as Bhrgukaccha, where brahmanas of the Bhrgu dynasty were performing yajnas.</p>
<p>Wearing a belt made of munja straw, an upper garment of deerskin and a sacred thread and carrying in His hands a danda, an umbrella and a waterpot (kamandalu), Lord Vamanadeva appeared in the sacrificial arena of Maharaja Bali.</p>
<p>Because of His transcendentally effulgent presence, all the priests were diminished in their prowess, and thus they all stood from their seats and offered prayers to Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Even Lord Siva accepts on his head the Ganges water generated from the toe of Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Therefore, after washing the Lord’s feet, Bali Maharaja immediately accepted the water from the Lord’s feet on his head and felt that he and his predecessors had certainly been glorified.</p>
<p>Then Bali Maharaja inquired of Lord Vamanadeva’s welfare and requested the Lord to ask him for money, jewels or anything He might desire.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: After Lord Brahma had thus spoken, glorifying the Supreme Lord’s activities and prowess, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never subject to death like an ordinary living being, appeared from the womb of Aditi.</p>
<p>His four hands were decorated with a conchshell, club, lotus and disc, He was dressed in yellow garments, and His eyes appeared like the petals of a blooming lotus.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word amrta-bhuh is significant in this verse.</p>
<p>The Lord sometimes appears like an ordinary child taking birth, but this does not mean that He is subject to birth, death or old age.</p>
<p>One must be very intelligent to understand the appearance and activities of the Supreme Lord in His incarnations.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9): janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah.</p>
<p>One should try to understand that the Lord’s appearance and disappearance and His activities are all divyam, or transcendental.</p>
<p>The Lord has nothing to do with material activities.</p>
<p>One who understands the appearance, disappearance and activities of the Lord is immediately liberated.</p>
<p>After giving up his body, he never again has to accept a material body, but is transferred to the spiritual world (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna (Bg.4.9)).</p>

<p>An uncommonly beautiful garland of flowers decorated His bosom, and because the flowers were extremely fragrant, a large group of bees, making their natural humming sounds, invaded them for honey.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>On the day of Sravana-dvadasi (the twelfth day of the bright fortnight in the month of Bhadra), when the moon came into the lunar mansion Sravana, at the auspicious moment of Abhijit, the Lord appeared in this universe.</p>
<p>Considering the Lord’s appearance very auspicious, all the stars and planets, from the sun to Saturn, were munificently charitable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, an expert astrologer, explains the word naksatra-taradyah.</p>
<p>The word naksatra means the stars the word tara in this context refers to the planets, and adyah means the first one specifically mentioned Among the planets, the first is Surya, the sun, not the moon.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the Vedic version, the modern astronomer’s proposition that the moon is nearest to the earth should not be accepted.</p>
<p>The chronological order in which people all over the world refer to the days of the week—Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday—corresponds to the Vedic order of the planets and thus circumstantiates the Vedic version.</p>
<p>Apart from this, when the Lord appeared the planets and stars became situated very auspiciously, according to astrological calculations, to celebrate the birth of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Lord appeared in His original form, with ornaments and weapons in His hands.</p>
<p>Although this ever-existing form is not visible in the material world, He nonetheless appeared in this form.</p>
<p>Then, in the presence of His father and mother, He assumed the form of Vamana, a brahmana-dwarf, a brahmacari, just like a theatrical actor.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word natah is significant.</p>
<p>An actor changes dress to play different parts, but is always the same man.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.33, 39), the Lord assumes many thousands and millions of forms (advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam adyam purana-purusam).</p>
<p>He is always present with innumerable incarnations (ramadi-murtisu kala-niyamena tisthan nanavataram akarod bhuvanesu kintu (Bs.5.39)).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, although He appears in various incarnations, they are not different from one another.</p>
<p>He is the same person, with the same potency, the same eternity and the same spiritual existence, but He can simultaneously assume various forms.</p>
<p>When Vamanadeva appeared from the womb of His mother, He appeared in the form of Narayana, with four hands equipped with the necessary symbolic weapons, and then immediately transformed Himself into a brahmacari (vatu).</p>
<p>This means that His body is not material.</p>
<p>One who thinks that the Supreme Lord assumes a material body is not intelligent.</p>
<p>He has to learn more about the Lord’s position.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah.</p>
<p>One has to understand the transcendental appearance of the Lord in His original transcendental body (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1)).</p>

<p>Lord Siva is known as Ganga-dhara, or one who carries the water of the Ganges on his head.</p>
<p>On Lord Siva’s forehead is the emblem of the half-moon, yet to give supreme respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Siva placed the water of the Ganges above this emblem.</p>
<p>This example should be followed by everyone, or at least by every devotee, because Lord Siva is one of the mahajanas.</p>

<p>One mahajana follows another mahajana, and by following the parampara system of mahajana activities one can become advanced in spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p>The water of the Ganges is sanctified because it emanates from the toe of Lord Visnu.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-17" id="summary-17">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#819-1" id="819-1">8.19</a></h3>
<p>This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Lord Vamanadeva asked for three paces of land in charity, how Bali Maharaja agreed to His proposal, and how Sukracarya forbade Bali Maharaja to fulfill Lord Vamanadeva’s request.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja, thinking Vamanadeva to be the son of a brahmana, told Him to ask for anything He liked, Lord Vamanadeva praised Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa for their heroic activities, and after thus praising the family in which Bali Maharaja had been born, He begged the King for three paces of land.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja agreed to give this land in charity, since this was very insignificant, but Sukracarya, who could understand that Vamanadeva was Visnu, the friend of the demigods, forbade Bali Maharaja to give this land.</p>
<p>Sukracarya advised Bali Maharaja to withdraw his promise.</p>
<p>He explained that in subduing others, in joking, in responding to danger, in acting for the welfare of others, and so on, one could refuse to fulfill one’s promise, and there would be no fault.</p>
<p>By this philosophy, Sukracarya tried to dissuade Bali Maharaja from giving land to Lord Vamanadeva.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O King, you are indeed exalted because your present advisors are the brahmanas who are descendants of Bhrgu and because your instructor for your future life is your grandfather, the peaceful and venerable Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>Your statements are very true, and they completely agree with religious etiquette.</p>
<p>They are in keeping with the behavior of your family, and they enhance your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja is a vivid example of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Someone might argue that since Prahlada Maharaja, even though very old, was attached to his family, and specifically to his grandson Bali Maharaja, how could he be an ideal example? Therefore this verse uses the word prasantah.</p>
<p>A devotee is always sober.</p>
<p>He is never disturbed by any conditions.</p>
<p>Even if a devotee remains in grhastha life and does not renounce material possessions, he should still be understood to be prasanta, sober, because of his pure devotion to the Lord.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore said:</p>
<p>kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya</p>
<p>yei krsna-tattva-vetta, sei ‘guru’ haya</p>
<p>Whether one is a brahmana, a sannyasi or a sudra—regardless of what he is—he can become a spiritual master if he knows the science of Krsna (Cc.Madhya 8.128) Anyone completely aware of the science of Krsna, regardless of his status in life, is a guru.</p>
<p>Thus Prahlada Maharaja is a guru in all circumstances.</p>
<p>Here His Lordship Vamanadeva also teaches sannyasis and brahmacaris that one should not ask more than necessary.</p>
<p>He wanted only three paces of land, although Bali Maharaja wanted to give Him anything He wanted.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of a ksatriya are given in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One of the qualifications is the willingness to give charity (dana).</p>
<p>A ksatriya does not refuse to give charity when requested by a brahmana, nor can he refuse to fight another ksatriya.</p>
<p>A king who does refuse is called low-minded.</p>

<p>Unable to see Him, Hiranyakasipu said, I have searched the entire universe, but I could not find Visnu, who has killed my brother.</p>
<p>Therefore, He must certainly have gone to that place from which no one returns (In other words, He must now be dead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Atheists generally follow the Bauddha philosophical conclusion that at death everything is finished.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu, being an atheist, thought this way.</p>
<p>Because Lord Visnu was not visible to him, he thought that the Lord was dead.</p>
<p>Even today, many people follow the philosophy that God is dead.</p>
<p>But God is never dead.</p>
<p>Even the living entity, who is part of God, never dies.</p>
<p>Na jayate mriyate va kadacit: For the soul there is never birth or death This is the statement of Bhagavad-gita (2.20).</p>
<p>Even the ordinary living entity never takes birth or dies.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the chief of all living entities? He certainly never takes birth or dies.</p>
<p>Ajo’pi sann avyayatma (Bg.4.6).</p>
<p>Both the Lord and the living entity exist as unborn and inexhaustible personalities.</p>
<p>Thus Hiranyakasipu’s conclusion that Visnu was dead was wrong.</p>
<p>As indicated by the words yato navartate puman, there is certainly a spiritual kingdom, and if the living entity goes there, he never returns to this material world.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9): tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so’rjuna.</p>
<p>Materially speaking, every living entity dies; death is inevitable.</p>
<p>But those who are karmis, jnanis and yogis return to this material world after death, whereas bhaktas do not.</p>
<p>Of course, if a bhakta is not completely perfect he takes birth in the material world again, but in a very exalted position, either in a rich family or a family of the purest brahmanas (sucinam srimatam gehe), just to finish his development in spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p>Those who have completed the course of Krsna consciousness and are free from material desire return to the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama (Bg.15.6)).</p>
<p>Here the same fact is stated:</p>
<p>yato navartate puman.</p>
<p>Any person who goes back home, back to Godhead, does not return to this material world.</p>

<p>O King, controller of the entire universe, although you are very munificent and are able to give Me as much land as I want, I do not want anything from you that is unnecessary.</p>
<p>If a learned brahmana takes charity from others only according to his needs, he does not become entangled in sinful activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A brahmana or sannyasi is qualified to ask charity from others, but if he takes more than necessary he is punishable.</p>
<p>No one can use more of the Supreme Lord’s property than necessary.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva indirectly indicated to Bali Maharaja that he was occupying more land than he needed.</p>
<p>In the material world, all distresses are due to extravagance.</p>
<p>One acquires money extravagantly and also spends it extravagantly.</p>
<p>Such activities are sinful.</p>
<p>All property belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all living beings, who are sons of the Supreme Lord, have the right to use the Supreme Father’s property, but one cannot take more than necessary.</p>
<p>This principle should especially be followed by brahmanas and sannyasis who live at the cost of others.</p>
<p>Thus Vamanadeva was an ideal beggar, for He asked only three paces of land.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a difference between His footsteps and those of an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His inconceivable prowess, can occupy the entire universe, including the upper, lower and middle planetary systems, by the unlimited measurement of His footsteps.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, You are a boy, and Your intelligence is insufficient.</p>
<p>Thus You are not very prudent in regard to Your self-interest.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being full in Himself, actually has nothing to want for His self-interest.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva, therefore, had not gone to Bali Maharaja for His own self-interest.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram.</p>
<p>The Lord is the proprietor of all planets, in both the material and spiritual worlds.</p>
<p>Why should He be in want of land? Bali Maharaja rightly said that Lord Vamanadeva was not at all prudent in regard to His own personal interests.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva had approached Bali not for His personal welfare but for the welfare of His devotees.</p>
<p>Devotees sacrifice all personal interests to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and similarly the Supreme Lord, although having no personal interests, can do anything for the interests of His devotees.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead said: O my dear King, even the entirety of whatever there may be within the three worlds to satisfy one’s senses cannot satisfy a person whose senses are uncontrolled.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material world is an illusory energy to deviate the living entities from the path of self-realization.</p>
<p>Anyone who is in this material world is extremely anxious to get more and more things for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Actually, however, the purpose of life is not sense gratification but self-realization.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who are too addicted to sense gratification are advised to practice the mystic yoga system, or astanga-yoga system, consisting of yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara and so on.</p>
<p>In this way, one can control the senses.</p>
<p>The purpose of controlling the senses is to stop one’s implication in the cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>As stated by Rsabhadeva:</p>
<p>nunam pramattah kurute vikarma</p>
<p>yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti</p>
<p>na sadhu manye yata atmano ’yam</p>
<p>asann api klesada asa dehah</p>
<p>(Bhag.5.5.4)</p>
<p>When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity.</p>
<p>He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery.</p>
<p>Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another (Bhag.5.5.4) Thus according to Rsabhadeva the human beings in this material world are just like madmen engaged in activities which they should not perform but which they do perform only for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Such activities are not good because in this way one creates another body for his next life, as punishment for his nefarious activities.</p>
<p>And as soon as he gets another material body, he is put into repeated suffering in material existence.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic culture or brahminical culture teaches one how to be satisfied with possessing the minimum necessities in life.</p>
<p>To teach this highest culture, varnasrama-dharma is recommended.</p>
<p>The aim of the varnasrama divisions—brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa—is to train one to control the senses and be content with the bare necessities.</p>
<p>Here Lord Vamanadeva, as an ideal brahmacari, refuses Bali Maharaja’s offer to give Him anything He might want.</p>
<p>He says that without contentment one could not be happy even if he possessed the property of the entire world or the entire universe.</p>
<p>In human society, therefore, the brahminical culture, ksatriya culture and vaisya culture must be maintained, and people must be taught how to be satisfied with only what they need.</p>
<p>In modern civilization there is no such education; everyone tries to possess more and more, and everyone is dissatisfied and unhappy.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore establishing various farms, especially in America, to show how to be happy and content with minimum necessities of life and to save time for self-realization, which one can very easily achieve by chanting the maha-mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One should be satisfied with whatever he achieves by his previous destiny, for discontent can never bring happiness.</p>
<p>A person who is not self-controlled will not be happy even with possessing the three worlds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If happiness is the ultimate goal of life, one must be satisfied with the position in which he is placed by providence.</p>
<p>This instruction is also given by Prahlada Maharaja:</p>
<p>sukham aindriyakam daitya</p>
<p>deha-yogena dehinam</p>
<p>sarvatra labhyate daivad</p>
<p>yatha duhkham ayatnatah</p>
<p>My dear friends born of demoniac families, the happiness perceived with reference to the sense objects by contact with the body can be obtained in any form of life, according to one’s past fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Such happiness is automatically obtained without endeavor, just as we obtain distress (Bhag.7.6.3) This philosophy is perfect in regard to obtaining happiness.</p>
<p>Real happiness is described in Bhagavad-gita (6.21):</p>
<p>sukham atyantikam yat tad</p>
<p>buddhi-grahyam atindriyam</p>
<p>vetti yatra na caivayam</p>
<p>sthitas calati tattvatah</p>
<p>In the spiritually joyous state, one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental senses.</p>
<p>Established thus, one never departs from the truth One has to perceive happiness by the supersenses.</p>
<p>The supersenses are not the senses of the material elements.</p>
<p>Every one of us is a spiritual being (aham brahmasmi), and every one of us is an individual person.</p>
<p>Our senses are now covered by material elements, and because of ignorance we consider the material senses that cover us to be our real senses.</p>
<p>The real senses, however, are within the material covering.</p>
<p>Dehino’smin yatha dehe: (Bg.2.13) within the covering of the material elements are the spiritual senses.</p>
<p>Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam: (Cc.Madhya 19.170) when the spiritual senses are uncovered, by these senses we can be happy.</p>
<p>Satisfaction of the spiritual senses is thus described: hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate.</p>
<p>When the senses are engaged in devotional service to Hrsikesa, then the senses are completely satisfied.</p>
<p>Without this superior knowledge of sense gratification, one may try to satisfy his material senses, but happiness will never be possible.</p>
<p>One may increase his ambition for sense gratification and even achieve what he desires for the gratification of his senses, but because this is on the material platform, he will never achieve satisfaction and contentment.</p>
<p>According to brahminical culture, one should be content with whatever he obtains without special endeavor and should cultivate spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p>Then he will be happy.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Krsna consciousness movement is to spread this understanding.</p>
<p>People who do not have scientific spiritual knowledge mistakenly think that the members of the Krsna consciousness movement are escapists trying to avoid material activities.</p>
<p>In fact, however, we are engaged in real activities for obtaining the ultimate happiness in life.</p>
<p>If one is not trained to satisfy the spiritual senses and continues in material sense gratification, he will never obtain happiness that is eternal and blissful.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.1) therefore recommends:</p>
<p>tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam</p>
<p>suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam</p>
<p>One must practice austerity so that his existential position will be purified and he will achieve unlimited blissful life.</p>

<p>After taking everything from you, He will deliver it to Indra, your enemy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains in this regard that the very word harih means one who takes away If one connects himself with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord takes away all his miseries, and in the beginning the Lord also superficially appears to take away all his material possessions, reputation, education and beauty.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.88.8), yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih.</p>
<p>The Lord said to Maharaja Yudhisthira, The first installment of My mercy toward a devotee is that I take away all his possessions, especially his material opulence, his money This is the special favor of the Lord toward a sincere devotee.</p>
<p>If a sincere devotee wants Krsna above everything but at the same time is attached to material possessions, which hinder his advancement in Krsna consciousness, by tactics the Lord takes away all his possessions.</p>
<p>Here Sukracarya says that this dwarf brahmacari would take away everything.</p>
<p>Thus he indicates that the Lord will take away all one’s material possessions and also one’s mind.</p>
<p>If one delivers his mind to the lotus feet of Krsna (sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh), one can naturally sacrifice everything to satisfy Him.</p>
<p>Although Bali Maharaja was a devotee, he was attached to material possessions, and therefore the Lord, being very kind to him, showed him special favor by appearing as Lord Vamana to take away all his material possessions, and his mind as well.</p>

<p>After giving everything to Lord Visnu, you will have no means of livelihood.</p>
<p>How then shall you live?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja might argue that he had promised only three steps of land.</p>
<p>But Sukracarya, being a very learned brahmana, immediately understood that this was a plan of Hari, who had falsely appeared there as a brahmacari.</p>
<p>The words mudha vartisyase katham reveal that Sukracarya was a brahmana of the priestly class.</p>
<p>Such priestly brahmanas are mostly interested in receiving remuneration from their disciples.</p>
<p>Therefore when Sukracarya saw that Bali Maharaja had risked all of his possessions, he understood that this would cause havoc not only to the King but also to the family of Sukracarya, who was dependent on Maharaja Bali’s mercy.</p>
<p>This is the difference between a Vaisnava and a smarta-brahmana.</p>
<p>A smarta-brahmana is always interested in material profit, whereas a Vaisnava is interested only in satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>From the statement of Sukracarya, it appears that he was in all respects a smarta-brahmana interested only in personal gain.</p>

<p>The Vedas enjoin that the factual result of the tree of the body is the good fruits and flowers derived from it.</p>
<p>But if the bodily tree does not exist, there is no possibility of factual fruits and flowers.</p>
<p>Even if the body is based on untruth, there cannot be factual fruits and flowers without the help of the bodily tree.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This sloka explains that in relation to the material body even the factual truth cannot exist without a touch of untruth.</p>
<p>The Mayavadis say, brahma satyam jagan mithya: The spirit soul is truth, and the external energy is untruth The Vaisnava philosophers, however, do not agree with the Mayavada philosophy.</p>
<p>Even if for the sake of argument the material world is accepted as untruth, the living entity entangled in the illusory energy cannot come out of it without the help of the body.</p>
<p>Without the help of the body, one cannot follow a system of religion, nor can one speculate on philosophical perfection.</p>
<p>Therefore, the flower and fruit (puspa-phalam) have to be obtained as a result of the body.</p>
<p>Without the help of the body, that fruit cannot be gained.</p>
<p>The Vaisnava philosophy therefore recommends yukta-vairagya.</p>
<p>It is not that all attention should be diverted for the maintenance of the body, but at the same time one’s bodily maintenance should not be neglected.</p>
<p>As long as the body exists one can thoroughly study the Vedic instructions, and thus at the end of life one can achieve perfection.</p>
<p>This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (Bg.8.6): yam yam vapi smaran bhavam tyajaty ante kalevaram.</p>
<p>Everything is examined at the time of death.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the body is temporary, not eternal, one can take from it the best service and make one’s life perfect.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Rupa Gosvami says:</p>

<p>vairagyam phalgu kathyate</p>
<p>One who rejects things without knowledge of their relationship to Krsna is incomplete in his renunciation (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu1.2.66) When the body is engaged in the service of the Lord, one should not consider the body material.</p>
<p>Sometimes the spiritual body of the spiritual master is misunderstood.</p>
<p>But Srila Rupa Gosvami instructs, prapancikataya buddhya hari-sambandhi-vastunah.</p>
<p>The body fully engaged in Krsna’s service should not be neglected as material.</p>
<p>One who does neglect it is false in his renunciation.</p>
<p>If the body is not properly maintained, it falls down and dries up like an uprooted tree, from which flowers and fruit can no longer be obtained.</p>
<p>The Vedas therefore enjoin:</p>

<p>The purport is that activities performed with the help of the body for the satisfaction of the Absolute Truth (om tat sat) are never temporary, although performed by the temporary body.</p>
<p>Indeed, such activities are everlasting.</p>
<p>Therefore, the body should be properly cared for.</p>
<p>Because the body is temporary, not permanent, one cannot expose the body to being devoured by a tiger or killed by an enemy.</p>
<p>All precautions should be taken to protect the body.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>parak—that which separates; riktam—that which makes one free from attachment; apurnam—that which is insufficient; va—either; aksaram—this syllable; yat—that; tat—which; om—omkara; iti—thus stated; yat—which; kincit—whatever; om—this word om; iti—thus; bruyat—if you say; tena—by such an utterance; ricyeta—one becomes free; vai—indeed; puman—a person; bhiksave—unto a beggar; sarvam—everything; om kurvan—giving charity by uttering the word om; na—not; alam—sufficiently; kamena—for sense gratification; ca—also; atmane—for self-realization.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The utterance of the word om signifies separation from one’s monetary assets.</p>
<p>In other words, by uttering this word one becomes free from attachment to money because his money is taken away from him.</p>
<p>To be without money is not very satisfactory, for in that position one cannot fulfill one’s desires.</p>
<p>In other words, by using the word om one becomes poverty-stricken.</p>
<p>Especially when one gives charity to a poor man or beggar, one remains unfulfilled in self-realization and in sense gratification.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Bali wanted to give everything to Vamanadeva, who had appeared as a beggar, but Sukracarya, being Maharaja Bali’s familial spiritual master in the line of seminal succession, could not appreciate Maharaja Bali’s promise.</p>
<p>Sukracarya gave Vedic evidence that one should not give everything to a poor man.</p>
<p>Rather, when a poor man comes for charity one should untruthfully say, Whatever I have I have given you.</p>
<p>I have no more It is not that one should give everything to him.</p>
<p>Actually the word om is meant for om tat sat, the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Omkara is meant for freedom from all attachment to money because money should be spent for the purpose of the Supreme.</p>
<p>The tendency of modern civilization is to give money in charity to the poor.</p>
<p>Such charity has no spiritual value because we actually see that although there are so many hospitals and other foundations and institutions for the poor, according to the three modes of material nature a class of poor men is always destined to continue.</p>
<p>Even though there are so many charitable institutions, poverty has not been driven from human society.</p>
<p>Therefore it is recommended here, bhiksave sarvam om kurvan nalam kamena catmane.</p>
<p>One should not give everything to the beggars among the poor.</p>
<p>The best solution is that of the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>This movement is always kind to the poor, not only because it feeds them but also because it gives them enlightenment by teaching them how to become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>We are therefore opening hundreds and thousands of centers for those who are poor, both in money and in knowledge, to enlighten them in Krsna consciousness and reform their character by teaching them how to avoid illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, which are the most sinful activities and which cause people to suffer, life after life.</p>
<p>The best way to use money is to open such a center, where all may come live and reform their character.</p>
<p>They may live very comfortably, without denial of any of the body’s necessities, but they live under spiritual control, and thus they live happily and save time for advancement in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If one has money, it should not be squandered away on nothing.</p>
<p>It should be used to push forward the Krsna consciousness movement so that all of human society will become happy, prosperous and hopeful of being promoted back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The Vedic mantra in this regard reads as follows:</p>
<p>parag va etad riktam aksaram yad etad om iti tad yat kincid om iti ahatraivasmai tad ricyate; sa yat sarvam om kuryad ricyad atmanam sa kamebhyo nalam syat.</p>

<p>Therefore, the safe course is to say no.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, if one always pleads that he has nothing, he is condemned, for he is a dead body while living, or while still breathing he should be killed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Beggars always present themselves as possessing nothing, and this may be very good for them because in this way they are assured of not losing their money and of always drawing the attention and compassion of others for the sake of collection.</p>
<p>But this is also condemned.</p>
<p>If one purposely continues this professional begging, he is supposed to be dead while breathing, or, according to another interpretation, such a man of falsity should be killed while still breathing.</p>
<p>The Vedic injunction in this regard is as follows: athaitat purnam abhyatmam yan neti sa yat sarvam neti bruyat papikasya kirtir jayate sainam tatraiva hanyat.</p>
<p>If one continuously poses himself as possessing nothing and collects money by begging, he should be killed (sainam tatraiva hanyat).</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#bali-maharaja-surrenders-the-universe" id="bali-maharaja-surrenders-the-universe">Bali Maharaja Surrenders the Universe</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-18" id="summary-18">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#820" id="820">8.20</a></h3>
<p>The summary of this Twentieth Chapter is as follows.</p>
<p>Despite his knowledge that Lord Vamanadeva was cheating him, Bali Maharaja gave everything to the Lord in charity, and thus the Lord extended His body and assumed a gigantic form as Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>After hearing the instructive advice of Sukracarya, Bali Maharaja became contemplative.</p>
<p>Because it is the duty of a householder to maintain the principles of religion, economic development and sense gratification, Bali Maharaja thought it improper to withdraw his promise to the brahmacari.</p>
<p>To lie or fail to honor a promise given to a brahmacari is never proper, for lying is the most sinful activity.</p>
<p>Everyone should be afraid of the sinful reactions to lying, for mother earth cannot even bear the weight of a sinful liar.</p>
<p>The spreading of a kingdom or empire is temporary; if there is no benefit for the general public, such expansion has no value.</p>
<p>Previously, all the great kings and emperors expanded their kingdoms with a regard for the welfare of the people in general.</p>
<p>Indeed, while engaged in such activities for the benefit of the general public, eminent men sometimes even sacrificed their lives.</p>
<p>It is said that one who is glorious in his activities is always living and never dies.</p>
<p>Therefore, fame should be the aim of life, and even if one becomes poverty-stricken for the sake of a good reputation, that is not a loss.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja thought that even if this brahmacari, Vamanadeva, were Lord Visnu, if the Lord accepted his charity and then again arrested him, Bali Maharaja would not envy Him.</p>
<p>Considering all these points, Bali Maharaja finally gave in charity everything he possessed.</p>
<p>Lord Vamanadeva then immediately extended Himself into a universal body.</p>
<p>By the mercy of Lord Vamanadeva, Bali Maharaja could see that the Lord is all-pervading and that everything rests in His body.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja could see Lord Vamanadeva as the supreme Visnu, wearing a helmet, yellow garments, the mark of Srivatsa, the Kaustubha jewel, a flower garland, and ornaments decorating His entire body.</p>
<p>The Lord gradually covered the entire surface of the world, and by extending His body He covered the entire sky.</p>
<p>With His hands He covered all directions, and with His second footstep He covered the entire upper planetary system.</p>
<p>Therefore there was no vacant place where He could take His third footstep.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King Pariksit, when Bali Maharaja was thus advised by his spiritual master, Sukracarya, his family priest, he remained silent for some time, and then, after full deliberation, he replied to his spiritual master as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Bali Maharaja remained silent at a critical point.</p>
<p>How could he disobey the instruction of Sukracarya, his spiritual master? It is the duty of such a sober personality as Bali Maharaja to abide by the orders of his spiritual master immediately, as his spiritual master had advised.</p>
<p>But Bali Maharaja also considered that Sukracarya was no longer to be accepted as a spiritual master, for he had deviated from the duty of a spiritual master.</p>
<p>According to sastra, the duty of the guru is to take the disciple back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>If he is unable to do so and instead hinders the disciple in going back to Godhead, he should not be a guru.</p>
<p>Gurur na sa syat (Bhag.5.5.18).</p>
<p>One should not become a guru if he cannot enable his disciple to advance in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The goal of life is to become a devotee of Lord Krsna so that one may be freed from the bondage of material existence (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>The spiritual master helps the disciple attain this stage by developing Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Now Sukracarya has advised Bali Maharaja to deny the promise to Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, therefore, Bali Maharaja thought that there would be no fault if he disobeyed the order of his spiritual master.</p>
<p>He deliberated on this point—should he refuse to accept the advise of his spiritual master, or should he independently do everything to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead? He took some time.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, tusnim bhutva ksanam rajann uvacavahito gurum.</p>
<p>After deliberating on this point, he decided that Lord Visnu should be pleased in all circumstances, even at the risk of ignoring the guru’s advice to the contrary.</p>
<p>Anyone who is supposed to be a guru but who goes against the principle of visnu-bhakti cannot be accepted as guru.</p>
<p>If one has falsely accepted such a guru, one should reject him.</p>
<p>Such a guru is described as follows (Mahabharata, Udyoga179.25):</p>
<p>guror apy avaliptasya</p>
<p>karyakaryam ajanatah</p>
<p>utpatha-pratipannasya</p>
<p>parityago vidhiyate</p>
<p>Srila Jiva Gosvami has advised that such a useless guru, a family priest acting as guru, should be given up, and that the proper, bona-fide guru should be accepted sat-karma-nipuno vipro</p>

<p>sri-balih uvaca—Bali Maharaja said; satyam—it is truth; bhagavata—by Your Greatness; proktam—what has already been spoken; dharmah—a religious principle; ayam—that is; grhamedhinam—especially for the householders; artham—economic development; kamam—sense gratification; yasah vrttim—reputation and means of livelihood; yah—which religious principle; na—not; badheta—hinders; karhicit—at any time.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja said: As you have already stated, the principle of religion that does not hinder one’s economic development, sense gratification, fame and means of livelihood is the real occupational duty of the householder.</p>
<p>I also think that this religious principle is correct.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja’s grave answer to Sukracarya is meaningful.</p>
<p>Sukracarya stressed that one’s material means of livelihood and one’s material reputation, sense gratification and economic development must continue properly.</p>
<p>To see to this is the first duty of a man who is a householder, especially one who is interested in material affairs.</p>
<p>If a religious principle does not affect one’s material condition, it is to be accepted.</p>
<p>At the present time, in this age of Kali, this idea is extremely prominent.</p>
<p>No one is prepared to accept any religious principle if it hampers material prosperity.</p>
<p>Sukracarya, being a person of this material world, did not know the principles of a devotee.</p>
<p>A devotee is determined to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead to His full satisfaction.</p>
<p>Anything that hampers such determination should certainly be rejected.</p>
<p>This is the principle of bhakti.</p>
<p>Anukulyasya sankalpah pratikulyasya varjanam (Cc.Madhya22.100).</p>
<p>To perform devotional service, one must accept only that which is favorable and reject that which is unfavorable.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja had the opportunity to contribute everything he possessed to the lotus feet of Lord Vamanadeva, but Sukracarya was putting forward a material argument to hamper this process of devotional service.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, Bali Maharaja decided that such hindrances should certainly be avoided.</p>
<p>In other words, he decided immediately to reject the advice of Sukracarya and go on with his duty.</p>
<p>Thus he gave all his possessions to Lord Vamanadeva.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I am the grandson of Maharaja Prahlada.</p>
<p>How can I withdraw my promise because of greed for money when I have already said that I shall give this land? How can I behave like an ordinary cheater, especially toward a brahmana?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja had already been blessed by his grandfather Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was a pure devotee, although born in a family of demons.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of highly elevated devotees, called sadhana-siddha and krpa-siddha.</p>
<p>Sadhana-siddha refers to one who has become a devotee by regular execution of the regulative principles mentioned in the sastras, as ordered and directed by the spiritual master.</p>
<p>If one regularly executes such devotional service, he will certainly attain perfection in due course of time.</p>
<p>But there are other devotees, who may not have undergone all the required details of devotional service but who, by the special mercy of guru and Krsna—the spiritual master and the Supreme Personality of Godhead—have immediately attained the perfection of pure devotional service.</p>
<p>Examples of such devotees are the yajna-patnis, Maharaja Bali and Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>The yajna-patnis were the wives of ordinary brahmanas engaged in fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Although the brahmanas were very learned and advanced in Vedic knowledge, they could not achieve the mercy of Krsna-Balarama, whereas their wives achieved complete perfection in devotional service, despite their being women.</p>
<p>Similarly, Vairocani, Bali Maharaja, received the mercy of Prahlada Maharaja, and by Prahlada Maharaja’s mercy he also received the mercy of Lord Visnu, who appeared before him as a brahmacari beggar.</p>
<p>Thus Bali Maharaja became a krpa-siddha because of the special mercy of both guru and Krsna.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu confirms this favor: guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija (Cc.Madhya19.151).</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, by the grace of Prahlada Maharaja, got the seed of devotional service, and when that seed developed, he achieved the ultimate fruit of that service, namely love of Godhead (prema pum-artho mahan), immediately upon the appearance of Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja regularly maintained devotion for the Lord, and because he was purified, the Lord appeared before him.</p>
<p>Because of unalloyed love for the Lord, he then immediately decided, I shall give this little dwarf brahmana whatever He asks from me This is a sign of love.</p>
<p>Thus Bali Maharaja is understood to be one who received the highest perfection of devotional service by special mercy.</p>

<p>Even in the most common dealings, people are accustomed to speaking so many lies.</p>

<p>The word vipra means brahmana, and at the same time confidential Bali Maharaja had confidentially decided to give the gift to Lord Vamanadeva without discussion, but because such a decision would hurt the hearts of the asuras and his spiritual master, Sukracarya, he spoke equivocally.</p>

<p>Dadhici, Sibi and many other great personalities were willing to sacrifice even their lives for the benefit of the people in general.</p>
<p>This is the evidence of history.</p>
<p>So why not give up this insignificant land? What is the serious consideration against it?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was prepared to give everything to Lord Visnu, and Sukracarya, being a professional priest, might have been anxiously waiting, doubting whether there had been any such instance in history in which one had given everything in charity.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, however, cited the tangible examples of Maharaja Sibi and Maharaja Dadhici, who had given up their lives for the benefit of the general public.</p>
<p>Certainly one has attachment for everything material, especially one’s land, but land and other possessions are forcibly taken away at the time of death, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (mrtyuh sarva-haras caham).</p>
<p>The Lord personally appeared to Bali Maharaja to take away everything he had, and thus he was so fortunate that he could see the Lord face to face.</p>
<p>Nondevotees, however, cannot see the Lord face to face; to such persons the Lord appears as death and takes away all their possessions by force.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, why should we not part with our possessions and deliver them to Lord Visnu for His satisfaction? Sri Canakya Pandita says in this regard, san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati (Canakya-sloka36).</p>
<p>Since our money and possessions do not last but will somehow or other be taken away, as long as they are in our possession it is better to use them for charity to a noble cause.</p>
<p>Therefore Bali Maharaja defied the order of his so-called spiritual master.</p>

<p>Bali Maharaja therefore decided not to follow his spiritual master’s instruction that he deny his promise to Vamanadeva; instead, he decided to give the land according to the promise and be everlastingly celebrated as one of the twelve mahajanas (balir vaiyasakir vayam).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O best of the brahmanas, many men have laid down their lives on the battlefield, being unafraid of fighting, but rarely has one gotten the chance to give his accumulated wealth faithfully to a saintly person who creates holy places.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Many ksatriyas have laid down their lives on the battlefield for their nations, but hardly a person can be found who has given up all his property and his accumulated wealth in charity to a person worthy of the gift.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (17.20):</p>
<p>datavyam iti yad danam</p>
<p>diyate ’nupakarine</p>
<p>dese kale ca patre ca</p>
<p>tad danam sattvikam smrtam</p>
<p>That gift which is given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a worthy person, and without expectation of return is considered to be charity in the mode of goodness Thus charity given in the proper place is called sattvika.</p>
<p>And above this charity in goodness is transcendental charity, in which everything is sacrificed for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Vamanadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, had come to Bali Maharaja for alms.</p>
<p>How could one get such an opportunity to give charity? Therefore, Bali Maharaja decided without hesitation to give the Lord whatever He wanted.</p>
<p>One may get various opportunities to lay down his life on the battlefield, but such an opportunity as this is hardly ever obtained.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By giving charity, a benevolent and merciful person undoubtedly becomes even more auspicious, especially when he gives charity to a person like your good self.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, I must give this little brahmacari whatever charity He wants from me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If one accepts a poverty-stricken position because of losing money in business, gambling, prostitution or intoxication, no one will praise him, but if one becomes poverty-stricken by giving all of his possessions in charity, he becomes adored all over the world.</p>
<p>Aside from this, if a benevolent and merciful person exhibits his pride in becoming poverty-stricken by giving his possessions in charity for good causes, his poverty is a welcome and auspicious sign of a great personality.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja decided that even though he would become poverty-stricken by giving everything to Vamanadeva, this is what he would prefer.</p>

<p>visnor aradhanam param</p>

<p>(Padma Purana)</p>
<p>Although in the Vedas there are recommendations for worshiping many demigods, Lord Visnu is the Supreme Person, and worship of Visnu is the ultimate goal of life.</p>
<p>The Vedic principles of the varnasrama institution are meant to organize society to prepare everyone to worship Lord Visnu varnasramacaravata</p>
<p>purusena parah puman</p>
<p>visnur aradhyate pantha</p>
<p>nanyat tat-tosa-karanam</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, is worshiped by the proper execution of prescribed duties in the system of varna and asrama.</p>
<p>There is no other way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Visnu Purana3.8.9) One must ultimately worship Lord Visnu, and for that purpose the varnasrama system organizes society into brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras, brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannyasis.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, having been perfectly educated in devotional service by his grandfather Prahlada Maharaja, knew how things are to be done.</p>
<p>He was never to be misguided by anyone, even by a person who happened to be his so-called spiritual master.</p>
<p>This is the sign of full surrender.</p>
<p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura said:</p>
<p>marabi rakhabi——yo iccha tohara</p>
<p>nitya-dasa-prati tuya adhikara</p>
<p>When one surrenders to Lord Visnu, one must be prepared to abide by His orders in all circumstances, whether He kills one or gives one protection.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu must be worshiped in all circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yadyapi—although; asau—Lord Visnu; adharmena—crookedly, without reference to the straight way; mam—me; badhniyat—kills; anagasam—although I am not sinful; tathapi—still; enam—against Him; na—not; himsisye—I shall take any retaliation; bhitam—because He is afraid; brahma-tanum—having assumed the form of a brahmana-brahmacari; ripum—even though He is my enemy.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although He is Visnu Himself, out of fear He has covered Himself in the form of a brahmana to come to me begging.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, because He has assumed the form of a brahmana, even if He irreligiously arrests me or even kills me, I shall not retaliate, although He is my enemy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If Lord Visnu as He is had come to Bali Maharaja and asked him to do something, Bali Maharaja certainly would not have refused His request.</p>
<p>But to enjoy a little humor between Himself and His devotee, the Lord covered Himself as a brahmana-brahmacari and thus came to Bali Maharaja to beg for only three feet of land.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If this brahmana really is Lord Visnu, who is worshiped by Vedic hymns, He would never give up His widespread reputation; either He would lie down having been killed by me, or He would kill me in a fight.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja’s statement that Visnu would lie down having been killed is not the direct meaning, for Visnu cannot be killed by anyone.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu can kill everyone, but He cannot be killed.</p>
<p>Thus the real meaning of the words lie dow is that Lord Visnu would reside within the core of Bali Maharaja’s heart.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is defeated by a devotee through devotional service; otherwise, no one can defeat Lord Visnu.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam—thus; asraddhitam—who was not very respectful to the instruction of the spiritual master; sisyam—unto such a disciple; anadesa-karam—who was not prepared to carry out the order of his spiritual master; guruh—the spiritual master (Sukracarya); sasapa—cursed; daiva-prahitah—being inspired by the Supreme Lord; satya-sandham—one who was fixed in his truthfulness; manasvinam—who was of a highly elevated character.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thereafter, the spiritual master, Sukracarya, being inspired by the Supreme Lord, cursed his exalted disciple Bali Maharaja, who was so magnanimous and fixed in truthfulness that instead of respecting his spiritual master’s instructions, he wanted to disobey his order.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the behavior of Bali Maharaja and that of his spiritual master, Sukracarya, was that Bali Maharaja had already developed love of Godhead, whereas Sukracarya, being merely a priest of routine rituals, had not.</p>
<p>Thus Sukracarya was never inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to develop in devotional service.</p>
<p>As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):</p>
<p>tesam satata-yuktanam</p>
<p>bhajatam priti-purvakam</p>
<p>dadami buddhi-yogam tam</p>
<p>yena mam upayanti te</p>
<p>To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me Devotees who actually engage in devotional service with faith and love are inspired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Vaisnavas are never concerned with ritualistic smarta-brahmanas.</p>
<p>Srila Sanatana Gosvami has therefore compiled Hari-bhakti-vilasa to guide the Vaisnavas, who never follow the smarta-viddhi.</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Lord is situated in the core of everyone’s heart, unless one is a Vaisnava, unless one is engaged in devotional service, one does not get sound advice by which to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Such instructions are meant only for devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore in this verse the word daiva-prahitah, being inspired by the Supreme Lord is important.</p>
<p>Sukracarya should have encouraged Bali Maharaja to give everything to Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>This would have been a sign of love for the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>But he did not do so.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he wanted to punish his devoted disciple by cursing him.</p>

<p>Although you have no knowledge, you have become a so-called learned person, and therefore you dare be so impudent as to disobey my order.</p>
<p>Because of disobeying me, you shall very soon be bereft of all your opulence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that Bali Maharaja was not pandita-mani, or one who falsely assumes himself learned; rather, he was pandita-manya-jnah, one who is so learned that all other learned persons worship him.</p>
<p>Aid because he was so learned, he could disobey the order of his so-called spiritual master.</p>
<p>He had no fear of any condition of material existence.</p>
<p>Anyone cared for by Lord Visnu does not need to care about anyone else.</p>
<p>Thus Bali Maharaja could never be bereft of all opulences.</p>
<p>The opulences offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead are not to be compared to the opulences obtained by karma-kanda.</p>
<p>In other words, if a devotee becomes very opulent, it is to be understood that his opulence is a gift of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Such opulence will never be vanquished, whereas the opulence achieved by one’s fruitive activity may be vanquished at any moment.</p>

<p>The unlimited Supreme Personality of Godhead, who had assumed the form of Vamana, then began increasing in size, acting in terms of the material energy, until everything in the universe was within His body, including the earth, the planetary systems, the sky, the directions, the various holes in the universe, the seas, the oceans, the birds, beasts, human beings, the demigods and the great saintly persons.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja wanted to give charity to Vamanadeva, but the Lord expanded His body in such a way that He showed Bali Maharaja that everything in the universe is already in His body.</p>
<p>Actually, no one can give anything to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is full in everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes we see a devotee offering Ganges water to the Ganges.</p>
<p>After taking his bath in the Ganges, a devotee takes a palmful of water and offers it back to the Ganges.</p>
<p>Actually, when one takes a palmful of water from the Ganges, the Ganges does not lose anything, and similarly if a devotee offers a palmful of water to the Ganges, the Ganges does not increase in any way.</p>
<p>But by such an offering, the devotee becomes celebrated as a devotee of mother Ganges.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we offer anything with devotion and faith, what we offer does not belong to us, nor does it enrich the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But if one offers whatever he has in his possession, he becomes a recognized devotee.</p>
<p>In this regard, the example is given that when one’s face is decorated with a garland and sandalwood pulp, the reflection of one’s face in a mirror automatically becomes beautiful.</p>
<p>The original source of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is our original source also.</p>
<p>Therefore when the Supreme Personality of Godhead is decorated, the devotees and all living entities are decorated automatically.</p>

<p>Mat-sthani sarva-bhutani na caham tesv avasthitah: everything rests in the body of the Lord, yet the Lord is not everywhere.</p>
<p>Mayavadi philosophers think that since the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, has become everything, He has no separate existence.</p>
<p>Their philosophy is called advaita-vada.</p>
<p>Actually, however, their philosophy is not correct.</p>
<p>Here, Bali Maharaja was the seer of the Personality of Godhead’s universal body, and that body was that which was seen.</p>

<p>From His words came all the Vedic mantras, on His tongue was the demigod of water, Varunadeva, on His eyebrows were the regulative principles, and on His eyelids were day and night (When His eyes were open it was daytime, and when they were closed it was night.) On His forehead was anger, and on His lips was greed.</p>
<p>O King, in His touch were lusty desires, in His semen were all the waters, on His back was irreligion, and in His wonderful activities or steps was the fire of sacrifice.</p>
<p>On His shadow was death, in His smile was the illusory energy, and on the hairs of His body were all the drugs and herbs.</p>
<p>In His veins were all the rivers, on His nails were all the stones, in His intelligence were Lord Brahma, the demigods and the great saintly persons, and throughout His entire body and senses were all living entities, moving and stationary.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja thus saw everything in the gigantic body of the Lord.</p>

<p>These associates, headed by Sunanda and other chief associates and accompanied by all the predominating deities of the various planets, offered prayers to the Lord, who wore a brilliant helmet, bracelets, and glittering earrings that resembled fish.</p>
<p>On the Lord’s bosom were the lock of hair called Srivatsa and the transcendental jewel named Kaustubha.</p>
<p>He wore a yellow garment, covered by a belt, and He was decorated by a flower garland, surrounded by bees.</p>
<p>Manifesting Himself in this way, O King, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose activities are wonderful, covered the entire surface of the earth with one footstep, the sky with His body, and all directions with His arms.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One might argue, Since Bali Maharaja promised Vamanadeva only the land occupied by His steps, why did Lord Vamanadeva occupy the sky also In this regard, Srila Jiva Gosvami says that the steps include everything, downward and upward.</p>
<p>When one stands up, he certainly occupies certain parts of the sky and certain portions of the earth below his feet.</p>
<p>Thus there was nothing uncommon for the Supreme Personality of Godhead when He occupied the entire sky with His body.</p>

<p>And not even a spot remained for the third step, for the Lord’s foot extended higher and higher, beyond Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and even Satyaloka.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When the Lord’s footstep exceeded the height of all the lokas, including Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka, His nails certainly pierced the covering of the universe.</p>
<p>The universe is covered by the five material elements (bhumir apo ’nalo vayuh kham).</p>
<p>As stated in the sastra, these elements are in layers, each ten times thicker than the previous one.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the nails of the Lord pierced through all these layers and made a hole penetrating into the spiritual world.</p>
<p>From this hole, the water of the Ganges infiltrated into this material world, and therefore it is said, pada-nakha-nira janita jana-pavana (Dasavatara-stotra5).</p>
<p>Because the Lord kicked a hole in the covering of the universe, the water of the Ganges came into this material world to deliver all the fallen souls.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-19" id="summary-19">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#821-1" id="821-1">8.21</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Visnu, desiring to advertise the glories of Bali Maharaja, arrested him for not fulfilling his promise in regard to the Lord’s third step.</p>
<p>With the second step the Supreme Personality of Godhead reached the topmost planet of the universe, Brahmaloka, which He diminished in beauty by the effulgence of His toenails.</p>
<p>Thus Lord Brahma, accompanied by great sages like Marici and the predominating deities of all the higher planets, offered humble prayers and worship to the Lord.</p>
<p>They washed the Lord’s feet and worshiped Him with all paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Rksaraja, Jambavan, played his bugle to vibrate the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja was deprived of all his possessions, the demons were very angry.</p>
<p>Although Bali Maharaja warned them not to do so, they took up weapons against Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>All of them were defeated, however, by Lord Visnu’s eternal associates, and, in accordance with Bali Maharaja’s order, they all entered the lower planets of the universe.</p>
<p>Understanding Lord Visnu’s purpose, Garuda, the carrier of Lord Visnu, immediately arrested Bali Maharaja with the ropes of Varuna.</p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja was thus reduced to a helpless position, Lord Visnu asked him for the third step of land.</p>
<p>Because Lord Visnu appreciated Bali Maharaja’s determination and integrity, when Bali Maharaja was unable to fulfill his promise, Lord Visnu ascertained that the place for him would be the planet Sutala, which is better than the planets of heaven.</p>

<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: When Lord Brahma, who was born of a lotus flower, saw that the effulgence of his residence, Brahmaloka, had been reduced by the glaring effulgence from the toenails of Lord Vamanadeva, he approached the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma was accompanied by all the great sages, headed by Marici, and by yogis like Sanandana, but in the presence of that glaring effulgence, O King, even Lord Brahma and his associates seemed insignificant.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Among the great personalities who came to worship the lotus feet of the Lord were those who had attained perfection in self-control and regulative principles, as well as experts in logic, history, general education and the Vedic literature known as kalpe (dealing with old historical incidents).</p>
<p>Others were experts in the Vedic corollaries like Brahma-samhita, all the other knowledge of the Vedas (Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva), and also the supplementary Vedic knowledge (Ayur-veda, Dhanur-veda, etc.).</p>
<p>Others were those who had been freed of the reactions to fruitive activities by transcendental knowledge awakened by practice of yoga.</p>
<p>And still others were those who had attained residence in Brahmaloka not by ordinary karma but by advanced Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>After devotedly worshiping the upraised lotus feet of the Supreme Lord with oblations of water, Lord Brahma, who was born of the lotus emanating from Lord Visnu’s navel, offered prayers to the Lord.</p>

<p>O King, the water from Lord Brahma’s kamandalu washed the lotus feet of Lord Vamanadeva, who is known as Urukrama, the wonderful actor.</p>
<p>Thus that water became so pure that it was transformed into the water of the Ganges, which went flowing down from the sky, purifying the three worlds like the pure fame of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here we understand that the Ganges began when the water from Lord Brahma’s kamandalu washed the lotus feet of Lord Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>But in the Fifth Canto it is stated that the Ganges began when Vamanadeva’s left foot pierced the covering of the universe so that the transcendental water of the Causal Ocean leaked through.</p>

<p>The water of the Ganges, therefore, is a combination of three transcendental waters, and thus the Ganges is able to purify the three worlds.</p>

<p>Vamanadeva first expanded Himself to the universal form and then reduced Himself to the original Vamana-rupa.</p>

<p>Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, never fear any condition of life.</p>
<p>For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord (Bhag.6.12.28) A devotee engaged in the service of Narayana is always in equilibrium.</p>
<p>A devotee actually lives transcendentally.</p>
<p>Although he may appear to have gone to hell or heaven, he does not live in either place; rather, he always lives in Vaikuntha (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate (Bg.14.26)).</p>
<p>Vamanadeva asked Bali Maharaja to go to the hellish planets, apparently just to show the entire universe how tolerant he was, and Bali Maharaja did not hesitate to carry out the order.</p>
<p>A devotee does not live alone.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because the devotee is engaged in His service, he actually does not live in any material condition.</p>
<p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, kita janma hao yatha tuya dasa.</p>
<p>Thus he prays to take birth as an insignificant insect in the association of devotees.</p>
<p>Because devotees are engaged in the service of the Lord, anyone who lives with them also lives in Vaikuntha.</p>

<p>Therefore, because your promise was false, you must live for a few years in hellish life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The false prestige of thinking I am very rich, and I possess such vast propert is another side of material life.</p>
<p>Everything belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and no one else possesses anything.</p>
<p>This is the real fact.</p>
<p>Isavasyam idam samam yat kinca jagatyam jagat.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was undoubtedly the most exalted devotee, whereas previously he had maintained a misunderstanding due to false prestige.</p>
<p>By the supreme will of the Lord, he now had to go to the hellish planets, but because he went there by the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he lived there more opulently than one could expect to live in the planets of heaven.</p>
<p>A devotee always lives with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, engaging in His service, and therefore he is always transcendental to hellish or heavenly residences.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-20" id="summary-20">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#822" id="822">8.22</a></h3>
<p>The summary of this Twenty-second Chapter is as follows.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead was pleased by the behavior of Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord placed him on the planet Sutala, and there, after bestowing benedictions upon him, the Lord agreed to become his doorman.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was extremely truthful.</p>
<p>Being unable to keep his promise, he was very much afraid, for he knew that one who has deviated from truthfulness is insignificant in the eyes of society.</p>
<p>An exalted person can suffer the consequences of hellish life, but he is very much afraid of being defamed for deviation from the truth.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja agreed with great pleasure to accept the punishment awarded him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In Bali Maharaja’s dynasty there were many asuras who because of their enmity toward Visnu had achieved a destination more exalted than that of many mystic yogis.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja specifically remembered the determination of Prahlada Maharaja in devotional service.</p>
<p>Considering all these points, he decided to give his head in charity as the place for Visnu’s third step.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja also considered how great personalities give up their family relationships and material possessions to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Indeed, they sometimes even sacrifice their lives for the satisfaction of the Lord, just to become His personal servants.</p>
<p>Accordingly, by following in the footsteps of previous acaryas and devotees, Bali Maharaja perceived himself successful.</p>
<p>While Bali Maharaja, having been arrested by the ropes of Varuna, was offering prayers to the Lord, his grandfather Prahlada Maharaja appeared there and described how the Supreme Personality of Godhead had delivered Bali Maharaja by taking his possessions in a tricky way.</p>
<p>While Prahlada Maharaja was present, Lord Brahma and Bali’s wife, Vindhyavali, described the supremacy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Since Bali Maharaja had given everything to the Lord, they prayed for his release.</p>
<p>The Lord then described how a nondevotee’s possession of wealth is a danger whereas a devotee’s opulence is a benediction from the Lord.</p>
<p>Then, being pleased with Bali Maharaja, the Supreme Lord offered His disc to protect Bali Maharaja and promised to remain with him.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja said: O best Personality of Godhead, most worshipable for all the demigods, if You think that my promise has become false, I shall certainly rectify matters to make it truthful.</p>
<p>I cannot allow my promise to be false.</p>
<p>Please, therefore, place Your third lotus footstep on my head.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja could understand the pretense of Lord Vamanadeva, who had taken the side of the demigods and come before him as a beggar.</p>
<p>Although the Lord’s purpose was to cheat him, Bali Maharaja took pleasure in understanding how the Lord will cheat His devotee to glorify the devotee’s position.</p>
<p>It is said that God is good, and this is a fact.</p>
<p>Whether He cheats or rewards, He is always good.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja therefore addressed Him as Uttamasloka Your Lordship he said, You are always praised with the best of selected verses.</p>
<p>On behalf of the demigods, You disguised Yourself to cheat me, saying that You wanted only three paces of land, but later You expanded Your body to such an extent that with two footsteps You covered the entire universe.</p>
<p>Because You were working on behalf of Your devotees, You do not regard this as cheating.</p>
<p>Never mind.</p>
<p>I cannot be considered a devotee.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, because although You are the husband of the goddess of fortune You have come to me to beg, I must satisfy You to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>So please do not think that I wanted to cheat You; I must fulfill my promise.</p>
<p>I still have my body.</p>
<p>When I place my body for Your satisfaction, please put Your third step on my head Since the Lord had covered the entire universe with two steps, one might ask how Bali Maharaja’s head could be sufficient for His third step? Bali Maharaja, however, thought that the possessor of wealth must be greater than the possession.</p>
<p>Therefore although the Lord had taken all his possessions, the head of Bali Maharaja, the possessor, would provide adequate place for the Lord’s third step.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Bali Maharaja fully surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he could not tolerate being defamed for cheating a brahmana-brahmacari, Being quite alert in regard to his reputation, he thought deeply about how to prevent being defamed.</p>
<p>The Lord, therefore, gave him the good counsel to prevent defamation by offering his head.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava does not fear any punishment.</p>

<p>Although a father, mother, brother or friend may sometimes punish one as a well-wisher, they never punish their subordinate like this.</p>
<p>But because You are the most worshipable Lord, I regard the punishment You have given me as most exalted.</p>

<p>One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances to You is certainly a bona fide candidate for liberation (Bhag.10.14.8) A devotee knows that so-called punishment by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is only His favor to correct His devotee and bring him to the right path.</p>
<p>Therefore the punishment awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be compared to even the greatest benefit awarded by one’s material father, mother, brother or friend.</p>

<p>Since Your Lordship is indirectly the greatest well-wisher of us demons, You act for our best welfare by posing as if our enemy.</p>
<p>Because demons like us always aspire for a position of false prestige, by chastising us You give us the eyes by which to see the right path.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja considered the Supreme Personality of Godhead a better friend to the demons than to the demigods.</p>
<p>In the material world, the more one gets material possessions, the more he becomes blind to spiritual life.</p>
<p>The demigods are devotees of the Lord for the sake of material possessions, but although the demons apparently do not have the Supreme Personality of Godhead on their side, He always acts as their well-wisher by depriving them of their positions of false prestige.</p>
<p>By false prestige one is misguided, so the Supreme Lord takes away their position of false prestige as a special favor.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja appreciated the Lord’s mercy not only upon him but upon many other demons.</p>
<p>Because this mercy is liberally distributed, the Supreme Lord is called all-merciful.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was indeed a fully surrendered devotee, but even some demons who were not at all devotees but merely enemies of the Lord attained the same exalted position achieved by many mystic yogis.</p>
<p>Thus Bali Maharaja could understand that the Lord had some hidden purpose in punishing him.</p>
<p>Consequently he was neither unhappy nor ashamed because of the awkward position in which he had been put by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>A vivid example is Prahlada Maharaja.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>What is the use of the material body, which automatically leaves its owner at the end of life? And what is the use of all one’s family members, who are actually plunderers taking away money that is useful for the service of the Lord in spiritual opulence? What is the use of a wife? She is only the source of increasing material conditions.</p>
<p>And what is the use of family, home, country and community? Attachment for them merely wastes the valuable energy of one’s lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, advises, sama-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: Give up all other varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me The common man does not appreciate such a statement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead because he thinks that during his lifetime his family, society, country, body and relatives are everything.</p>
<p>Why should one give up any one of them and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? But from the behavior of great personalities like Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja we understand that surrendering to the Lord is the right action for an intelligent person.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja took shelter of Visnu against the will of his father.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bali Maharaja took shelter of Vamanadeva against the will of his spiritual master, Sukracarya, and all the leading demons.</p>
<p>People may be surprised that devotees like Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja could seek shelter of the side of the enemy, giving up the natural affinity for family, hearth and home.</p>
<p>In this connection, Bali Maharaja explains that the body, which is the center of all material activities, is also a foreign element.</p>
<p>Even though we want to keep the body fit and helpful to our activities, the body cannot continue eternally.</p>
<p>Although I am the soul, which is eternal, after using the body for some time I have to accept another body (tatha dehantara-praptih), according to the laws of nature, unless I render some service with the body for advancement in devotional service.</p>
<p>One should not use the body for any other purpose.</p>
<p>One must know that if he uses the body for any other purpose he is simply wasting time, for as soon as the time is ripe, the soul will automatically leave the body.</p>
<p>We are very interested in society, friendship and love, but what are they? Those in the garb of friends and relatives merely plunder the hard-earned money of the bewildered soul.</p>
<p>Everyone is affectionate toward his wife and is attached to her, but what is this wife? The wife is called stri, which means, one who expands the material condition If a person lives without a wife, his material conditions are less extensive.</p>
<p>As soon as one marries and is connected with a wife, his material necessities increase pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam</p>
<p>tayor mitho hrdaya-granthim ahuh</p>
<p>ato grha-ksetra-sutapta-vittair</p>
<p>janasya moho ’yam aham mameti</p>
<p>The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence.</p>
<p>On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth.</p>
<p>In this way one increases life’s illusions and thinks in terms of ‘I and mine.’ (Bhag.5.5.8) Human life is meant for self-realization, not for increasing unwanted things.</p>
<p>Actually, a wife increases unwanted things.</p>
<p>One’s lifetime, one’s home and everything one has, if not properly used in the service of the Lord, are all sources of material conditions of perpetual suffering under the threefold miseries (adhyatmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no institution in human society for education on this subject.</p>
<p>People are kept in darkness about the goal of life, and thus there is a continuous struggle for existence.</p>
<p>We speak of survival of the fittest but no one survives, for no one is free under material conditions.</p>

<p>Only by providence have I been saved from that condition.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja appreciated the actions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although all the members of the demoniac families except Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja considered Visnu their eternal traditional enemy.</p>
<p>As described by Bali Maharaja, Lord Visnu was actually not the enemy of the family but the best friend of the family.</p>
<p>The principle of this friendship has already been stated.</p>
<p>Yasyaham anugrhnami harisye tad-dhanam sanaih: the Lord bestows special favor upon His devotee by taking away all his material opulences.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja appreciated this behavior by the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore he said, daivena nitah prasabham tyajita-srih: It is to bring me to the right platform of eternal life that You have put me into these circumstances Actually, everyone should fear the so-called society, friendship and love for which he works so hard all day and night.</p>
<p>As indicated by Bali Maharaja by the words janad bhitah, every devotee in Krsna consciousness should always be afraid of the common man engaged in pursuing material prosperity.</p>
<p>Such a person is described as pramatta, a madman chasing the will-o’-the-wisp.</p>
<p>Such men do not know that after a hard struggle for life one must change his body, with no certainty of what kind of body he will receive next.</p>
<p>Those who are completely established in Krsna conscious philosophy and who therefore understand the aim of life will never take to the activities of the materialistic dog race.</p>
<p>But if a sincere devotee somehow does fall down, the Lord corrects him and saves him from gliding down to the darkest region of hellish life adanta-gobhir visatam tamisram</p>
<p>punah punas carvita-carvananam</p>
<p>(Bhag.7.5.30)</p>
<p>The materialistic way of life is nothing but the repeated chewing of that which has already been chewed.</p>
<p>Although there is no profit in such a life, people are enamored of it because of uncontrolled senses.</p>

<p>Because of uncontrolled senses, people fully engage in sinful activities by which they get a body full of suffering.</p>

<p>His tall, elegant figure was dressed in yellow garments, he had long arms, and his beautiful eyes were like the petals of a lotus.</p>
<p>He was very dear and pleasing to everyone.</p>

<p>Being bound by the ropes of Varuna, Bali Maharaja could not offer befitting respect to Prahlada Maharaja as he had before.</p>
<p>Rather, he simply offered respectful obeisances with his head, his eyes being inundated with tears and his face lowered in shame.</p>

<p>Since Bali Maharaja had been arrested by Lord Vamanadeva, he was certainly to be considered an offender.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja seriously felt that he was an offender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Certainly Prahlada Maharaja would not like this.</p>
<p>Therefore Bali Maharaja was ashamed and hung his head.</p>

<p>It is by the mercy of the Lord that one gets all material opulence, but if such material opulence causes one to become puffed up and forget the process of self-realization, the Lord certainly takes all the opulence away.</p>
<p>The Lord bestows mercy upon His devotee by helping him find out his constitutional position.</p>
<p>For that purpose, the Lord is always ready to help the devotee in every way.</p>
<p>But material opulence is sometimes dangerous because it diverts one’s attention to false prestige by giving one the impression that he is the owner and master of everything he surveys, although actually this is not the fact.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Srimati Vindhyavali said: O my Lord, You have created the entire universe for the enjoyment of Your personal pastimes, but foolish, unintelligent men have claimed proprietorship for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Certainly they are shameless agnostics.</p>
<p>Falsely claiming proprietorship, they think they can give charity and enjoy.</p>
<p>In such a condition, what good can they do for You, who are the independent creator, maintainer and annihilator of this universe?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja’s wife, who was most intelligent, supported the arrest of her husband and accused him of having no intelligence because he had claimed proprietorship of the property of the Lord.</p>
<p>Such a claim is a sign of demoniac life.</p>
<p>Although the demigods, who are officials appointed by the Lord for management, are attached to materialistic enjoyment, they never claim to be proprietors of the universe, for they know that the actual proprietor of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the qualification of the demigods.</p>
<p>But the demons, instead of accepting the exclusive proprietorship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, claim the property of the universe for themselves through demarcations of nationalism This part is mine, and that part is yours they say This part I can give in charity, and this part I can keep for my enjoyment These are all demoniac conceptions.</p>
<p>This is described in Bhagavad-gita (16.13): idam adya maya labdham imam prapsye manoratham Thus far I have acquired so much money and land.</p>
<p>Now I have to add more and more.</p>
<p>In this way I shall be the greatest proprietor of everything.</p>
<p>Who can compete with me These are all demoniac conceptions.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja’s wife accused Bali Maharaja by saying that although the Supreme Personality of Godhead had arrested him, showing him extraordinary mercy, and although Bali Maharaja was offering his body to the Supreme Lord for the Lord’s third step, he was still in the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>Actually the body did not belong to him, but because of his long-standing demoniac mentality he could not understand this.</p>
<p>He thought that since he had been defamed for his inability to fulfill his promise of charity, and since the body belonged to him, he would free himself from defamation by offering his body.</p>
<p>Actually, however, the body does not belong to anyone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by whom the body is given.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):</p>
<p>isvarah sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati</p>
<p>bhramayan sarva-bhutani</p>
<p>yantrarudhani mayaya</p>
<p>The Lord is situated in the core of everyone’s heart, and, according to the material desires of the living entity, the Lord offers a particular type of machine—the body—through the agency of the material energy.</p>
<p>The body actually does not belong to the living entity; it belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, how could Bali Maharaja claim that the body belonged to him? Thus Vindhyavali, Bali Maharaja’s intelligent wife, prayed that her husband be released, by the Lord’s causeless mercy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Bali Maharaja was nothing but a shameless demon, specifically described as tyakta-hriyas tvad-avaropita-kartr-vadah, a foolish person claiming proprietorship over the property of the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>In the present age, Kali-yuga, the number of such shameless men, who are agnostics disbelieving in the existence of God, has increased.</p>
<p>Trying to defy the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so-called scientists, philosophers and politicians manufacture plans and schemes for the destruction of the world.</p>
<p>They cannot do anything good for the world, and unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, they have plunged the affairs of the world into mismanagement.</p>
<p>Thus there is a great need for the Krsna consciousness movement for the benefit of innocent people who are being carried away by propaganda of such demons.</p>
<p>If the present status quo is allowed to continue, people will certainly suffer more and more under the leadership of these demoniac agnostics.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While rotating in the cycle of birth and death again and again in different species because of his own fruitive activities, the dependent living entity, by good fortune, may happen to become a human being.</p>
<p>This human birth is very rarely obtained.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully independent.</p>
<p>Thus it is not always a fact that a living being’s loss of all opulence is a sign of the Supreme Lord’s mercy upon him.</p>
<p>The Lord can act any way He likes.</p>
<p>He may take away one’s opulence, or He may not.</p>
<p>There are varieties of forms of life, and the Lord treats them according to the circumstances, as He chooses.</p>

<p>The living entity in material nature follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>This is due to his association with that material nature.</p>
<p>Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species (Bg.13.22) After thus rotating through many, many forms of life in the cycle of birth and death, the living being gets a chance for a human form.</p>
<p>Therefore every human being, especially one belonging to a civilized nation or culture, must be extremely responsible in his activities.</p>
<p>He should not risk degradation in the next life.</p>
<p>Because the body will change (tatha dehantara-praptir), we should be extremely careful.</p>
<p>To see to the proper use of life is the purpose of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>The foolish living entity declares freedom from all control, but factually he is not free; he is fully under the control of material nature.</p>

<p>If a human being is born in an aristocratic family or a higher status of life, if he performs wonderful activities, if he is youthful, if he has personal beauty, a good education and good wealth, and if he is nonetheless not proud of his opulences, it is to be understood that he is especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When in spite of possessing all these opulences a person is not proud, this means that he is fully aware that all his opulences are due to the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He therefore engages all his possessions in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>A devotee knows very well that everything, even his body, belongs to the Supreme Lord.</p>

<p>The conclusion is that one’s being deprived of his wealth is not to be considered the special mercy of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although aristocratic birth and other such opulences are impediments to advancement in devotional service because they are causes of false prestige and pride, these opulences never disturb a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Devotees like Dhruva Maharaja, who was given unlimited material opulence, have the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Once Kuvera wanted to give Dhruva Maharaja a benediction, but although Dhruva Maharaja could have asked him for any amount of material opulence, he instead begged Kuvera that he might continue his devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When a devotee is fixed in his devotional service, there is no need for the Lord to deprive him of his material opulences.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead never takes away material opulences achieved because of devotional service, although He sometimes takes away opulences achieved by pious activities.</p>
<p>He does this to make a devotee prideless or put him in a better position in devotional service.</p>
<p>If a special devotee is meant for preaching but does not give up his family life or material opulences to take to the service of the Lord, the Lord surely takes away his material opulences and establishes him in devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus the pure devotee becomes fully engaged in propagating Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>esah—this Bali Maharaja; danava-daityanam—among the demons and unbelievers; agranih—the foremost devotee; kirti-vardhanah—the most famous; ajaisit—has already surpassed; ajayam—the insurmountable; mayam—material energy; sidan—being bereft (of all material opulences); api—although; na—not; muhyati—is bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja has become the most famous among the demons and nonbelievers, for in spite of being bereft of all material opulences, he is fixed in his devotional service.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, the words sidann api na muhyati are very important.</p>
<p>A devotee is sometimes put into adversity while executing devotional service.</p>
<p>In adversity, everyone laments and becomes aggrieved, but by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee, even in the worst condition, can understand that he is going through a severe examination by the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja passed all such examinations, as explained in the following verses.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#82229-30" id="82229-30">8.22.29-30</a></h3>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although bereft of his riches, fallen from his original position, defeated and arrested by his enemies, rebuked and deserted by his relatives and friends, although suffering the pain of being bound and although rebuked and cursed by his spiritual master, Bali Maharaja, being fixed in his vow, did not give up his truthfulness.</p>
<p>It was certainly with pretension that I spoke about religious principles, but he did not give up religious principles, for he is true to his word.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja passed the severe test put before him by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is further proof of the Lord’s mercy toward His devotee.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead sometimes puts a devotee to severe tests that are almost unbearable.</p>
<p>One could hardly even live under the conditions forced upon Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>That Bali Maharaja endured all these severe tests and austerities is the mercy of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord certainly appreciates the devotee’s forbearance, and it is recorded for the future glorification of the devotee.</p>
<p>This was not an ordinary test.</p>
<p>As described in this verse, hardly anyone could survive such a test, but for the future glorification of Bali Maharaja, one of the mahajanas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead not only tested him but also gave him the strength to tolerate such adversity.</p>
<p>The Lord is so kind to His devotee that when severely testing him the Lord gives him the necessary strength to be tolerant and continue to remain a glorious devotee.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>esah—Bali Maharaja; me—by Me; prapitah—has achieved; sthanam—a place; dusprapam—extremely difficult to obtain; amaraih api—even by the demigods; savarneh antarasya—during the period of the Manu known as Savarni; ayam—this Bali Maharaja; bhavita—will become; indrah—the lord of the heavenly planet; mat-asrayah—completely under My protection.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Lord continued: Because of his great tolerance, I have given him a place not obtainable even by the demigods.</p>
<p>He will become King of the heavenly planets during the period of the Manu known as Savarni.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Even if the Lord takes away a devotee’s material opulences, the Lord immediately offers him a position of which the demigods cannot even dream.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this in the history of devotional service.</p>
<p>One of them is the opulence of Sudama Vipra.</p>
<p>Sudama Vipra suffered severe material scarcity, but he was not disturbed and did not deviate from devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he was ultimately given an exalted position by the mercy of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Here the word mad-asrayah is very significant.</p>
<p>Because the Lord wanted to give Bali Maharaja the exalted position of Indra, the demigods might naturally have been envious of him and might have fought to disturb his position.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Personality of Godhead assured Bali Maharaja that he would always remain under the Lord’s protection (mad-asrayah).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Until Bali Maharaja achieves the position of King of heaven, he shall live on the planet Sutala, which was made by Visvakarma according to My order.</p>
<p>Because it is especially protected by Me, it is free from mental and bodily miseries, fatigue, dizziness, defeat and all other disturbances.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja, you may now go live there peacefully.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Visvakarma is the engineer or architect for the palatial buildings in the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Therefore, since he was engaged to construct the residential quarters of Bali Maharaja, the buildings and palaces on the planet Sutala must at least equal those on the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>A further advantage of this place designed for Bali Maharaja was that he would not be disturbed by any outward calamity.</p>
<p>Moreover, he would not be disturbed by mental or bodily miseries.</p>
<p>These are all extraordinary features of the planet Sutala, where Bali Maharaja would live.</p>
<p>In the Vedic literatures we find descriptions of many different planets where there are many, many palaces, hundreds and thousands of times better than those of which we have experience on this planet earth.</p>
<p>When we speak of palaces, this naturally includes the idea of great cities and towns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when modern scientists try to explore other planets they see nothing but rocks and sand.</p>
<p>Of course, they may go on their frivolous excursions, but the students of the Vedic literature will never believe them or give them any credit for exploring other planets.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja was transferred from the heavenly planet to the planet Sutala, which is hundreds of times better than heaven, as indicated by the words svargibhih prarthyam.</p>
<p>When the Supreme Personality of Godhead deprives His devotee of material opulences, this does not mean that the Lord puts him into poverty; rather, the Lord promotes him to a higher position.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead did not ask Bali Maharaja to separate from his family; instead, the Lord allowed him to stay with his family members (jnatibhih parivaritah).</p>

<p>The Lord assured Bali Maharaja of all protection, and finally the Lord assured him of protection from the effects of bad association with the demons.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-21" id="summary-21">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#823" id="823">8.23</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Bali Maharaja, along with his grandfather Prahlada Maharaja, entered the planet Sutala and how the Supreme Personality of Godhead allowed Indra to reenter the heavenly planet.</p>
<p>The great soul Bali Maharaja experienced that the highest gain in life is to attain devotional service under the shelter of the Lord’s lotus feet in full surrender.</p>
<p>Being fixed in this conclusion, his heart full of ecstatic devotion and his eyes full of tears, he offered obeisances to the Personality of Godhead and then, with his associates, entered the planet known as Sutala.</p>
<p>Thus the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfied the desire of Aditi and reinstalled Lord Indra.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja, being aware of Bali’s release from arrest, then described the transcendental pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in this material world.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja praised the Supreme Lord for creating the material world, for being equal to everyone and for being extremely liberal to the devotees, just like a desire tree.</p>
<p>Indeed, Prahlada Maharaja said that the Lord is kind not only to His devotees but also to the demons.</p>
<p>In this way he described the unlimited causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then, with folded hands, he offered his respectful obeisances unto the Lord, and after circumambulating the Lord he also entered the planet Sutala in accordance with the Lord’s order.</p>
<p>The Lord then ordered Sukracarya to describe Bali Maharaja’s faults and discrepancies in executing the sacrificial ceremony.</p>
<p>Sukracarya became free from fruitive actions by chanting the holy name of the Lord, and he explained how chanting can diminish all the faults of the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>He then completed Bali Maharaja’s sacrificial ceremony.</p>
<p>All the great saintly persons accepted Lord Vamanadeva as the benefactor of Lord Indra because He had returned Indra to his heavenly planet.</p>
<p>They accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the maintainer of all the affairs of the universe.</p>
<p>Being very happy, Indra, along with his associates, placed Vamanadeva before him and reentered the heavenly planet in their airplane.</p>
<p>Having seen the wonderful activities of Lord Visnu in the sacrificial arena of Bali Maharaja, all the demigods, saintly persons, Pitas, Bhutas and Siddhas glorified the Lord again and again.</p>
<p>The chapter concludes by saying that the most auspicious function of the conditioned soul is to chant and hear about the glorious activities of Lord Visnu.</p>

<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: When the supreme, ancient, eternal Personality of Godhead had thus spoken to Bali Maharaja, who is universally accepted as a pure devotee of the Lord and therefore a great soul, Bali Maharaja, his eyes filled with tears, his hands folded and his voice faltering in devotional ecstasy, responded as follows.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bali Maharaja said: What a wonderful effect there is in even attempting to offer respectful obeisances to You! I merely endeavored to offer You obeisances, but nonetheless the attempt was as successful as those of pure devotees.</p>
<p>The causeless mercy You have shown to me, a fallen demon, was never achieved even by the demigods or the leaders of the various planets.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Vamanadeva appeared before Bali Maharaja, Bali Maharaja immediately wanted to offer Him respectful obeisances, but he was unable to do so because of the presence of Sukracarya and other demoniac associates.</p>
<p>The Lord is so merciful, however, that although Bali Maharaja did not actually offer obeisances but only endeavored to do so within his mind, the Supreme Personality of Godhead blessed him with more mercy than even the demigods could ever expect.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.40), svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: Even a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as bhava-grahi janardana because He takes only the essence of a devotee’s attitude.</p>
<p>If a devotee sincerely surrenders, the Lord, as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart, immediately understands this.</p>
<p>Thus even though, externally, a devotee may not render full service, if he is internally sincere and serious the Lord welcomes his service nonetheless.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord is known as bhava-grahi janardana because He takes the essence of one’s devotional mentality.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my Lord, Your pastimes are all wonderfully performed by Your inconceivable spiritual energy; and by her perverted reflection, the material energy, You have created all the universes.</p>
<p>As the Supersoul of all living entities, You are aware of everything, and therefore You are certainly equal toward everyone.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, You favor Your devotees.</p>
<p>This is not partiality, however, for Your characteristic is just like that of a desire tree, which yields everything according to one’s desire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):</p>
<p>samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu</p>
<p>na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah</p>
<p>ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya</p>
<p>mayi te tesu capy aham</p>
<p>I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone.</p>
<p>I am equal to all.</p>
<p>But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him The Supreme Personality of Godhead is certainly equal toward all living entities, but a devotee who fully surrenders at the lotus feet of the Lord is different from a nondevotee.</p>
<p>In other words, everyone can take shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord to enjoy equal benedictions from the Lord, but nondevotees do not do so, and therefore they suffer the consequences created by the material energy.</p>
<p>We can understand this fact by a simple example.</p>
<p>The king or government is equal to all citizens.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a citizen capable of receiving special favors from the government is offered such favors, this does not mean that the government is partial.</p>
<p>One who knows how to receive favors from the authority can receive them, but one who does not neglects these favors and does not receive them.</p>
<p>There are two classes of men—the demons and the demigods.</p>
<p>The demigods are fully aware of the Supreme Lord’s position, and therefore they are obedient to Him, but even if demons know about the supremacy of the Lord they purposely defy His authority.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord makes distinctions according to the mentality of the living being, but otherwise He is equal to everyone.</p>
<p>Like a desire tree, the Lord fulfills the desires of one who takes shelter of Him, but one who does not take such shelter is distinct from the surrendered soul.</p>
<p>One who takes shelter at the lotus feet of the Lord is favored by the Lord, regardless of whether such a person is a demon or a demigod.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead assured Prahlada Maharaja: You shall be able to see Me there in My usual feature with conchshell, disc, club and lotus in My hand.</p>
<p>Because of your transcendental bliss due to always personally seeing Me, you will have no further bondage to fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Karma-bandha, the bondage of fruitive activities, entails the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>One performs fruitive activities in such a way that he creates another body for his next life.</p>
<p>As long as one is attached to fruitive activities, he must accept another material body.</p>
<p>This repeated acceptance of material bodies is called samsara-bandhana.</p>
<p>To stop this, a devotee is advised to see the Supreme Lord constantly.</p>
<p>The kanistha-adhikari, or neophyte devotee, is therefore advised to visit the temple every day and see the form of the Lord regularly.</p>
<p>Thus the neophyte devotee can be freed from the bondage of fruitive activities.</p>

<p>O best of the brahmanas, Sukracarya, please describe the fault or discrepancy in your disciple Bali Maharaja, who engaged in performing sacrifices.</p>
<p>This fault will be nullified when judged in the presence of qualified brahmanas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Bali Maharaja and Prahlada Maharaja had departed for the planet Sutala, Lord Visnu asked Sukracarya what the fault was in Bali Maharaja for which Sukracarya had cursed him.</p>
<p>It might be argued that since Bali Maharaja had now left the scene, how could his faults be judged? In reply to this, Lord Visnu informed Sukracarya that there was no need for Bali Maharaja’s presence, for his faults and discrepancies could be nullified if judged before the brahmanas.</p>
<p>As will be seen in the next verse, Bali Maharaja had no faults; Sukracarya had unnecessarily cursed him.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this was better for Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Being cursed by Sukracarya, Bali Maharaja was deprived of all his possessions, with the result that the Supreme Personality of Godhead favored him for his strong faith in devotional service.</p>
<p>Of course, a devotee is not required to engage in fruitive activities.</p>
<p>As stated in the sastra, sarvarhanam acyutejya (Bhag.4.31.14).</p>
<p>By worshiping Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one satisfies everyone.</p>
<p>Because Bali Maharaja had satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there were no discrepancies in his performance of sacrifices.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukracarya said: My Lord, You are the enjoyer and lawgiver in all performances of sacrifice, and You are the yajna-purusa, the person to whom all sacrifices are offered.</p>
<p>If one has fully satisfied You, where is the chance of discrepancies or faults in his performances of sacrifice?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (5.29) the Lord says, bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram: the Lord, the supreme proprietor, is the actual person to he satisfied by the performance of yajnas.</p>
<p>Visnu Purana (3.8.9) says:</p>
<p>varnasramacaravata</p>
<p>purusena parah puman</p>
<p>visnur aradhyate pantha</p>
<p>nanyat tat-tosa-karanam</p>
<p>All the Vedic ritualistic sacrifices are performed for the purpose of satisfying Lord Visnu, the yajna-purusa.</p>
<p>The divisions of society—brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa—are all meant to satisfy the Supreme Lord, Visnu.</p>
<p>To act according to this principle of the varnasrama institution is called varnasramacarana.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.13), Suta Gosvami says:</p>
<p>atah pumbhir dvija-srestha</p>
<p>varnasrama-vibhagasah</p>
<p>svanusthitasya dharmasya</p>
<p>samsiddhir hari-tosanam</p>
<p>O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve by discharging his prescribed duties according to caste divisions and orders of life is to please the Personality of Godhead Everything is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, since Bali Maharaja had satisfied the Lord, he had no faults, and Sukracarya admitted that cursing him was not good.</p>

<p>There may be discrepancies in pronouncing the mantras and observing the regulative principles, and, moreover, there may be discrepancies in regard to time, place, person and paraphernalia.</p>
<p>But when Your Lordship’s holy name is chanted, everything becomes faultless.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended:</p>
<p>harer nama harer nama</p>
<p>harer namaiva kevalam</p>
<p>kalau nasty eva nasty eva</p>
<p>nasty eva gatir anyatha</p>
<p>(Adi 17.21)</p>
<p>In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way (Brhan-naradiya Purana38.126) In this age of Kali, it is extremely difficult to perform Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or sacrifices perfectly.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone can chant the Vedic mantras with perfect pronunciation or accumulate the paraphernalia for Vedic performances.</p>
<p>Therefore the sacrifice recommended in this age is sankirtana, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag.11.5.29).</p>
<p>Instead of wasting time performing Vedic sacrifices, those who are intelligent, those who possess good brain substance, should take to the chanting of the Lord’s holy name and thus perform sacrifice perfectly.</p>
<p>I have seen that many religious leaders are addicted to performing yajnas and spending hundreds and thousands of rupees for imperfect sacrificial performances.</p>
<p>This is a lesson for those who unnecessarily execute such imperfect sacrifices.</p>
<p>We should take the advice of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah).</p>
<p>Although Sukracarya was a strict brahmana addicted to ritualistic activities, he also admitted, nischidram anusankirtanam tava: My Lord, constant chanting of the holy name of Your Lordship makes everything perfect In Kali-yuga the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies cannot be performed as perfectly as before.</p>
<p>Therefore Srila Jiva Gosvami has recommended that although one should take care to follow all the principles in every kind of spiritual activity, especially in worship of the Deity, there is still a chance of discrepancies, and one should compensate for this by chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In our Krsna consciousness movement we therefore give special stress to the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra in all activities.</p>

<p>The Lord therefore says in Bhagavad-gita (10.42), vistabhyaham idam krtsnam ekamsena sthito jagat: With a single fragment of Myself, I pervade and support this entire universe The material world consists of innumerable universes, each one full of innumerable planets, which are all considered to be products of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s material energy.</p>
<p>Yet this is only one fourth of God’s creation.</p>
<p>The other three fourths of creation constitute the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Among the innumerable planets in only one universe, the so-called scientists cannot understand even the moon and Mars, but they try to defy the creation of the Supreme Lord and His uncommon energy.</p>
<p>Such men have been described as crazy.</p>
<p>Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma (Bhag.5.5.4).</p>
<p>Such crazy men unnecessarily waste time, energy and money in attempting to defy the glorious activities of Urukrama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-22" id="summary-22">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#824-1" id="824-1">8.24</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s incarnation as a fish, and it also describes the saving of Maharaja Satyavrata from an inundation.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead expands Himself by svamsa (His personal expansions) and vibhinnamsa (His expansions as the living entities).</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears on this planet for the protection of the sadhus, or devotees, and for the destruction of the miscreants, or nondevotees.</p>
<p>He especially descends to give protection to the cows, the brahmanas, the demigods, the devotees and the Vedic system of religion.</p>
<p>Thus He appears in various forms—sometimes as a fish, sometimes a boar, sometimes Nrsimhadeva, sometimes Vamanadeva and so on—but in any form or incarnation, although He comes within the atmosphere of the material modes of nature, He is unaffected.</p>
<p>This is a sign of His supreme controlling power.</p>
<p>Although He comes within the material atmosphere, maya cannot touch Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, no material qualities can be attributed to Him in any degree.</p>
<p>Once, at the end of the previous kalpa, a demon named Hayagriva wanted to take the Vedic knowledge away from Lord Brahma at the time of annihilation.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead took the incarnation of a fish at the beginning of the period of Svayambhuva Manu and saved the Vedas.</p>
<p>During the reign of Caksusa Manu there was a king named Satyavrata, who was a great pious ruler.</p>
<p>To save him, the Lord appeared as the fish incarnation for a second time.</p>
<p>King Satyavrata later became the son of the sun-god and was known as Sraddhadeva.</p>
<p>He was established as Manu by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>To receive the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Satyavrata engaged in the austerity of subsisting only by drinking water.</p>
<p>Once, while performing this austerity on the bank of the Krtamala River and offering oblations of water with the palm of his hand, he found a small fish.</p>
<p>The fish appealed to the King for protection, asking the King to keep Him in a safe place.</p>
<p>Although the King did not know that the small fish was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, as a king he gave shelter to the fish and kept Him in a water jug.</p>
<p>The fish, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, wanted to show His potency to King Satyavrata, and thus He immediately expanded His body in such a way that He could no longer be kept in the jug of water.</p>
<p>The King then put the fish in a big well, but the well was also too small.</p>
<p>Then the King put the fish in a lake, but the lake was also unsuitable.</p>
<p>Finally the King put the fish in the sea, but even the sea could not accommodate Him.</p>
<p>Thus the King understood that the fish was no one else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he requested the Lord to describe His incarnation as a fish.</p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead, being pleased with the King, informed him that within a week there would be an inundation throughout the universe and that the fish incarnation would protect the King, along with the rsis, herbs, seeds and other living entities, in a boat, which would be attached to the fish’s horn.</p>
<p>After saying this, the Lord disappeared.</p>
<p>King Satyavrata offered respectful obeisances to the Supreme Lord and continued to meditate upon Him.</p>
<p>In due course of time, annihilation took place, and the King saw a boat coming near.</p>
<p>After getting aboard with learned brahmanas and saintly persons, he offered prayers to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, and thus he taught Maharaja Satyavrata and the saintly persons about Vedic knowledge from the core of the heart.</p>
<p>King Satyavrata took his next birth as Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Vivasvan manave praha: the sun-god spoke the science of Bhagavad-gita to his son Manu.</p>
<p>Because of being the son of Vivasvan, this Manu is known as Vaivasvata Manu.</p>
<p>—This commentation has been finished in our New Delhi center today, the first of September, 1976, the day of Radhastami, by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the acaryas.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja’s question to Sukadeva Gosvami was based on this principle stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):</p>
<p>yada yada hi dharmasya</p>
<p>glanir bhavati bharata</p>
<p>abhyutthanam adharmasya</p>

<p>Vamanadeva, for example, appeared to save the devotee Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepted the abominable form of a fish, He must have done so to favor some devotee.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja was eager to know about the devotee for whom the Supreme Lord accepted this form.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King, for the sake of protecting the cows, brahmanas, demigods, devotees, the Vedic literature, religious principles, and principles to fulfill the purpose of life, the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts the forms of incarnations.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead generally appears in various types of incarnations to give protection to the cows and brahmanas.</p>
<p>The Lord is described as go-brahmana-hitaya ca; in other words, He is always eager to benefit the cows and brahmanas.</p>
<p>When Lord Krsna appeared, He purposefully became a cowherd boy and showed personally how to give protection to the cows and calves.</p>
<p>Similarly, He showed respect to Sudama Vipra, a real brahmana.</p>
<p>From the Lord’s personal activities, human society should learn how to give protection specifically to the brahmanas and cows.</p>
<p>Then the protection of religious principles, fulfillment of the aim of life and protection of Vedic knowledge can be achieved.</p>
<p>Without protection of cows, brahminical culture cannot be maintained; and without brahminical culture, the aim of life cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Lord, therefore, is described as go-brahmana-hitaya because His incarnation is only for the protection of the cows and brahmanas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because in Kali-yuga there is no protection of the cows and brahminical culture, everything is in a precarious position.</p>
<p>If human society wants to be exalted, the leaders of society must follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and give protection to the cows, the brahmanas and brahminical culture.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Like the air passing through different types of atmosphere, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although appearing sometimes as a human being and sometimes as a lower animal, is always transcendental.</p>
<p>Because He is above the material modes of nature, He is unaffected by higher and lower forms.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the master of the material nature (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram (Bg.9.10)).</p>
<p>Therefore, being the supreme controller of the laws of nature, the Lord cannot be under their influence.</p>
<p>An example given in this regard is that although the wind blows through many places, the air is not affected by the qualities of these places.</p>
<p>Although the air sometimes carries the odor of a filthy place, the air has nothing to do with such a place.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, being all-good and all-auspicious, is never affected by the material qualities like an ordinary living entity purusah prakrti-stho hi bhunkte prakrtijan gunan (Bg.13.21).</p>
<p>When the living entity is in the material nature, he is affected by its qualities.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is not affected.</p>
<p>Disrespectfully, one who does not know this considers the Supreme Personality of Godhead an ordinary living being (avajananti mam mudhah).</p>
<p>Param bhavam ajanantah: such a conclusion is reached by the unintelligent because they are unaware of the transcendental qualities of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my Lord, possessing eyes like the petals of a lotus, the worship of the demigods, who are in the bodily concept of life, is fruitless in all respects.</p>
<p>But because You are the supreme friend and dearmost Supersoul of everyone, worship of Your lotus feet is never useless.</p>
<p>You have therefore manifested Your form as a fish.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods like Indra, Candra and Surya are ordinary living entities who are differentiated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord expands Himself through the living beings (nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam).</p>
<p>His personal visnu-tattva forms, which are all spiritual, are called svamsa, and the living entities who are differentiated parts are called vibhinnamsa.</p>
<p>Some of the vibhinnamsa forms are spiritual, and some are a combination of matter and spirit.</p>
<p>The conditioned souls in the material world are different from their external bodies made of material energy.</p>
<p>Thus the demigods living in the upper planetary systems and the living entities living in the lower planetary system are of the same nature.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those living as human beings on this planet are sometimes attracted to worshiping the demigods in the higher planetary systems.</p>
<p>Such worship is temporary.</p>
<p>As the human beings on this planet have to change their bodies (tatha dehantara-praptih), the living entities known as Indra, Candra, Varuna and so on will also have to change their bodies in due course of time.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary Kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah: (Bg.7.20) those who do not know the position of the demigods are inclined to worship the demigods for some material purpose, but the results of such worship are never permanent.</p>
<p>Consequently, here it is said, yathetaresam prthag-atmanam satam, padopasarpanam mrsa bhavet.</p>
<p>In other words, if one is to worship someone else, he must worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then his worship will never be fruitless.</p>
<p>Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: even a slight attempt to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead is a permanent asset.</p>
<p>Therefore, as recommended in Srimad-Bhagavatam, tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam hareh.</p>
<p>One should take to the worship of the lotus feet of Hari, even if this means giving up the so-called occupational duty assigned because of the particular body one has accepted.</p>
<p>Because worship in terms of the body is temporary, it does not bear any permanent fruit.</p>
<p>But worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead gives immense benefit.</p>

<p>Pulling the boat, with you and all the rsis in it, O King, I shall travel in the water of devastation until the night of Lord Brahma’s slumber is over.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This particular devastation actually took place not during the night of Lord Brahma but during his day, for it was during the time of Caksusa Manu.</p>
<p>Brahma’s night takes place when Brahma goes to sleep, but in the daytime there are fourteen Manus, one of whom is Caksusa Manu.</p>
<p>Therefore, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that although it was daytime for Lord Brahma, Brahma felt sleepy for a short time by the supreme will of the Lord.</p>
<p>This short period is regarded as Lord Brahma’s night.</p>
<p>This has been elaborately discussed by Srila Rupa Gosvami in his Laghu-bhagavatamrta.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of his analysis.</p>
<p>Because Agastya Muni cursed Svayambhuva Manu, during the time of Svayambhuva Manu a devastation took place.</p>
<p>This devastation is mentioned in the Matsya Purana.</p>
<p>During the time of Caksusa Manu, by the supreme will of the Lord, there was suddenly another pralaya, or devastation.</p>
<p>This is mentioned by Markandeya Rsi in the Visnu-dharmottara.</p>
<p>At the end of Manu’s time there is not necessarily a devastation, but at the end of the Caksusa-manvantara, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by His illusory energy, wanted to show Satyavrata the effects of devastation.</p>
<p>Srila Sridhara Svami also agrees with this opinion.</p>
<p>The Laghu-bhagavatamrta says:</p>
<p>madhye manvantarasyaiva</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You will be thoroughly advised and favored by Me, and because of your inquiries, everything about My glories, which are known as param brahma, will be manifest within your heart.</p>
<p>Thus you will know everything about Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma, is situated in everyone’s heart, and from Him come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The Lord reveals Himself in proportion to one’s surrender to Him.</p>
<p>Ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham (Bg.4.11).</p>
<p>In responsive cooperation, the Lord reveals Himself in proportion to one’s surrender.</p>
<p>That which is revealed to one who fully surrenders is different from what is revealed to one who surrenders partially.</p>
<p>Everyone naturally surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul surrenders to the laws of nature in material existence, but when one fully surrenders to the Lord, material nature does not act upon him.</p>
<p>Such a fully surrendered soul is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.</p>
<p>Mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te (Bg.7.14).</p>
<p>One who has fully surrendered to the Lord has no fear of the modes of material nature, for everything is but an expansion of the Lord’s glories (sarvam khalv idam brahma), and these glories are gradually revealed and realized.</p>
<p>The Lord is the supreme purifier (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12)).</p>
<p>The more one is purified and the more he wants to know about the Supreme, the more the Lord reveals to him.</p>
<p>Full knowledge of Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan is revealed to the pure devotees.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):</p>

<p>I accept that Supreme Personality of Godhead as the supreme spiritual master.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the supreme spiritual master.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord knows everything about the suffering of the conditioned soul, and therefore He appears in this material world, sometimes personally, sometimes by an incarnation and sometimes by authorizing a living being to act on His behalf.</p>
<p>In all cases, however, He is the original spiritual master who enlightens the conditioned souls who are suffering in the material world.</p>
<p>The Lord is always busy helping the conditioned souls in many ways.</p>
<p>Therefore He is addressed here as paramo gurur bhavan.</p>
<p>The representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who acts to spread Krsna consciousness is also guided by the Supreme Lord to act properly in executing the Lord’s order.</p>
<p>Such a person may appear to be an ordinary human being, but because he acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual master, he is not to be neglected as ordinary.</p>
<p>It is therefore said, acaryam mam vijaniyat: an acarya who acts on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead should be understood to be as good as the Supreme Lord Himself saksad dharitvena samasta-sastrair</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who wants to be free of material entanglement should take to the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and give up the contamination of ignorance, involving pious and impious activities.</p>
<p>Thus one regains his original identity, just as a block of gold or silver sheds all dirt and becomes purified when treated with fire.</p>
<p>May that inexhaustible Supreme Personality of Godhead become our spiritual master, for He is the original spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In human life one is meant to undergo austerity to purify one’s existence.</p>
<p>Tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam suddhyet.</p>
<p>Because of contamination by the modes of material nature, one continues in the cycle of birth and death (karanam guna-sango ’sya sad-asad-yoni janmasu).</p>
<p>Therefore the purpose of human life is to purify oneself of this contamination so that one can regain his spiritual form and not undergo this cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>The recommended process of decontamination is devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>There are various processes for self-realization, such as karma, jnana and yoga, but none of them is equal to the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>As gold and silver can be freed from all dirty contamination by being put into a fire but not merely by being washed, the living entity can be awakened to his own identity by performing devotional service (yat-sevaya), but not by karma, jnana or yoga.</p>
<p>Cultivation of speculative knowledge or practice of yogic gymnastics will not be helpful.</p>
<p>The word varnam refers to the luster of one’s original identity.</p>
<p>The original luster of gold or silver is brilliant.</p>
<p>Similarly, the original luster of the living being, who is part of the sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), is the luster of ananda, or pleasure.</p>
<p>Anandamayo bhyasat.</p>
<p>Every living entity has the right to become anandamaya, joyful, because he is part of the sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), Krsna.</p>
<p>Why should the living being be put into tribulation because of dirty contamination by the material modes of nature? The living entity should become purified and regain his svarupa, his original identity.</p>
<p>This he can do only by devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should adopt the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described here as guror guruh, the spiritual master of all other spiritual masters.</p>
<p>Even though we may not have the fortune to contact the Supreme Lord personally, the Lord’s representative is as good as the Lord Himself because such a representative does not say anything unless it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore gives a definition of guru.</p>
<p>Yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa: (Cc.Madhya 7.128) the bona fide guru is he who advises his disciples exactly in accordance with the principles spoken by Krsna.</p>
<p>The bona fide guru is he who has accepted Krsna as guru.</p>
<p>This is the guru-parampara system.</p>
<p>The original guru is Vyasadeva because he is the speaker of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, wherein everything spoken relates to Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore guru-puja is known as Vyasa-puja.</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the original guru is Krsna, His disciple is Narada, whose disciple is Vyasa, and in this way we gradually come in touch with the guru-parampara.</p>
<p>One cannot become a guru if he does not know what the Personality of Godhead Krsna or His incarnation wants.</p>
<p>The mission of the guru is the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: to spread Krsna consciousness all over the world.</p>

<p>Therefore I wish to take shelter of Your lotus feet.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah: (Bg.7.20) people in general, being motivated by material desires, worship the demigods to get fruitive results very quickly.</p>
<p>People generally do not become devotees of Lord Visnu, since Lord Visnu never becomes the order-supplier of His devotee.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu does not give a devotee benedictions that will create a further demand for benedictions.</p>
<p>By worshiping the demigods one may get results, but, as described in Bhagavad-gita, antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: whatever great benedictions one may achieve from the demigods are all temporary.</p>
<p>Because the demigods themselves are temporary, their benedictions are also temporary and have no permanent value.</p>
<p>Those who aspire for such benedictions have a poor fund of knowledge (tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam).</p>
<p>The benedictions of Lord Visnu are different.</p>
<p>By the mercy of the Lord Visnu, one can be completely freed from material contamination and go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the benedictions offered by the demigods cannot compare to even one ten-thousandth of the Lord’s benedictions.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, try to obtain benedictions from the demigods or false gurus.</p>
<p>One should aspire only for the benediction offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The conditioned soul, being wrapped in ignorance and therefore not knowing the goal of life, accepts a guru who can juggle words and make some display of magic that is wonderful to a fool.</p>
<p>Sometimes a foolish person accepts someone as a guru because he can manufacture a small quantity of gold by mystic yogic power.</p>
<p>Because such a disciple has a poor fund of knowledge, he cannot judge whether the manufacture of gold is the criterion for a guru.</p>
<p>Why should one not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, from whom unlimited numbers of gold mines come into being? Aham sarvasya prabhavo mattah sarvam pravartate (Bg.10.8).</p>
<p>All the gold mines are created by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, why should one accept a magician who can manufacture only a small portion of gold? Such gurus are accepted by those who are blind, not knowing the goal of life.</p>
<p>Maharaja Satyavrata, however, knew the goal of life.</p>
<p>He knew the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he accepted the Lord as his guru.</p>
<p>Either the Supreme Lord or His representative can become guru.</p>
<p>The Lord says, mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te: (Bg.7.14) One can get relief from the clutches of maya as soon as he surrenders unto Me Therefore it is the guru’s business to instruct his disciple to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he wants relief from the material clutches.</p>
<p>This is the symptom of the guru.</p>
<p>This same principle was instructed by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu: yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa (Cc.Madhya 7.128).</p>
<p>In other words, one is advised not to accept a guru who does not follow the path of instruction given by Lord Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>So-called gurus instruct their disciples for the sake of material profit.</p>

<p>But although You are within the heart, the foolish, because of lusty desires in the heart, cannot understand You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Herein the reason for foolishness is described.</p>
<p>Because the conditioned soul in this material world is full of materialistic lusty desires, he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although the Lord is situated in everyone’s heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese’rjuna tisthati (Bg.18.61)).</p>
<p>It is because of this foolishness that one cannot take instructions from the Lord, although the Lord is ready to instruct everyone both externally and internally.</p>
<p>The Lord says, dadami buddhi-yogam tam yena mam upayanti te.</p>
<p>In other words, the Lord can give instructions on devotional service by which one can return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, people do not take this devotional service.</p>
<p>The Lord, being situated in everyone’s heart, can give one complete instructions on going back to Godhead, but because of lusty desires one engages himself in materialistic activities and does not render service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore one is bereft of the value of the Lord’s instructions.</p>
<p>By mental speculation one can understand that one is not the body but a spirit soul, but unless one engages in devotional service, the real purpose of life is never fulfilled.</p>
<p>The real purpose of life is to go back home, back to Godhead, and live with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, play with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, dance with the Supreme Personality of Godhead and eat with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>These are different items of ananda, spiritual happiness in spiritual variegatedness.</p>
<p>Even though one may come to the platform of brahma-bhuta and understand his spiritual identity by speculative knowledge, one cannot enjoy spiritual life without understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is indicated here by the word abhista-siddhih.</p>
<p>One can fulfill the ultimate goal of life only by engaging in devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Then the Lord will give one proper instructions on how to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Supreme Lord, for self-realization I surrender unto You, who are worshiped by the demigods as the supreme controller of everything.</p>
<p>By Your instructions, exposing life’s purpose, kindly cut the knot from the core of my heart and let me know the destination of my life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it is argued that people do not know who is a spiritual master and that finding a spiritual master from whom to get enlightenment in regard to the destination of life is very difficult.</p>
<p>To answer all these questions, King Satyavrata shows us the way to accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the real spiritual master.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord has given full directions in Bhagavad-gita about how to deal with everything in this material world and how to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should not be misled by so-called gurus who are rascals and fools.</p>
<p>Rather, one should directly see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the guru or instructor.</p>
<p>It is difficult, however, to understand Bhagavad-gita without the help of the guru.</p>
<p>Therefore the guru appears in the parampara system.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead recommends:</p>
<p>tad viddhi pranipatena</p>
<p>pariprasnena sevaya</p>
<p>upadeksyanti te jnanam</p>
<p>jnaninas tattva-darsinah</p>
<p>Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.</p>
<p>Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth Lord Krsna directly instructed Arjuna.</p>
<p>Arjuna is therefore tattva-darsi or guru.</p>
<p>Arjuna accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12)).</p>
<p>Similarly, following in the footsteps of Sri Arjuna, who is a personal devotee of the Lord, one should accept the supremacy of Lord Krsna, as supported by Vyasa, Devala, Asita, Narada and later by the acaryas Ramanujacarya, Madhvacarya, Nimbarka and Visnusvami and still later by the greatest acarya, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Where, then, is the difficulty in finding a guru? If one is sincere he can find the guru and learn everything.</p>
<p>One should take lessons from the guru and find out the goal of life.</p>
<p>Maharaja Satyavrata, therefore, shows us the way of the mahajana.</p>
<p>Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah.</p>
<p>One should surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dasavatara) and learn from Him about the spiritual world and the goal of life.</p>

<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who pretended to be a gigantic fish, who restored the Vedic literature to Lord Brahma when Lord Brahma awakened from sleep, and who explained the essence of Vedic literature to King Satyavrata and the great saintly persons.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is a summary of Satyavrata’s meeting with the fish incarnation of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu’s purpose was to take back all the Vedic literatures from the demon Hayagriva and restore them to Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Incidentally, by His causeless mercy, the Lord spoke with Satyavrata.</p>
<p>The word satyavratanam is significant because it indicates that those on the level of Satyavrata can take knowledge from the Vedas delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Whatever is spoken by the Supreme Lord is accepted as Veda.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, vedanta-krd veda-vit: the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the compiler of all Vedic knowledge, and He knows the purport of the Vedas.</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who takes knowledge from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, or from Bhagavad-gita as it is, knows the purpose of the Vedas (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>One cannot understand Vedic knowledge from the veda-vada-ratas, who read the Vedas and misconstrue their subject matter.</p>
<p>One has to know the Vedas from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa janame janame haya, ei abhilasa.</p>
<p>I am attempting to present Srimad-Bhagavatam in the English language by the order of my spiritual master, Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, and by his grace the work of translation is gradually progressing, and the European and American devotees who have joined the Krsna consciousness movement are helping me considerably.</p>
<p>Thus we have expectations of finishing the great task before my passing away.</p>
<p>All glories to Sri Guru and Gauranga.</p>
