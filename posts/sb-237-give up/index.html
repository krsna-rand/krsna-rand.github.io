<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—the same Jada Bharata who was formerly Maharaja Bharata, the son of Maharaja Rsabhadeva; dustyajan—very difficult to give up; dara-sutan—the wife and children or the most opulent family life; suhrt—friends and well-wishers; rajyam—a kingdom that extended all over the world; hrdi-sprsah—that which is situated within the core of one’s heart; jahau—he gave up; yuva eva—even as a young man; mala-vat—like stool; uttama-sloka-lalasah—who was so fond of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, known as Uttamasloka.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While in the prime of life, the great Maharaja Bharata gave up everything because he was fond of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Uttamasloka.</p>
<p>He gave up his beautiful wife, nice children, great friends and an enormous empire.</p>
<p>Although these things were very difficult to give up, Maharaja Bharata was so exalted that he gave them up just as one gives up stool after evacuating.</p>
<p>Such was the greatness of His Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The name of God is Krsna, because He is so attractive that the pure devotee can give up everything within this material world on His behalf.</p>
<p>Maharaja Bharata was an ideal king, instructor and emperor of the world.</p>
<p>He possessed all the opulences of the material world, but Krsna is so attractive that He attracted Maharaja Bharata from all his material possessions.</p>
<p>Yet somehow or other, the King became affectionate to a little deer and, falling from his position, had to accept the body of a deer in his next life.</p>
<p>Due to Krsna’s great mercy upon him, he could not forget his position, and he could understand how he had fallen.</p>
<p>Therefore in the next life, as Jada Bharata, Maharaja Bharata was careful not to spoil his energy, and therefore he presented himself as a deaf and dumb person.</p>
<p>In this way he could concentrate on his devotional service.</p>
<p>We have to learn from the great King Bharata how to become cautious in cultivating Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>A little inattention will retard our devotional service for the time being.</p>
<p>Yet any service rendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is never lost: svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat (Bg.2.40).</p>
<p>A little devotional service rendered sincerely is a permanent asset.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.5.17):</p>
<p>tyaktva sva-dharmam caranambujam harer</p>
<p>bhajann apakvo ’tha patet tato yadi</p>
<p>yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim</p>
<p>ko vartha apto ’bhajatam sva-dharmatah</p>
<p>Somehow or other, if one is attracted to Krsna, whatever he does in devotional service is a permanent asset.</p>
<p>Even if one falls down due to immaturity or bad association, his devotional assets are never lost.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this—Ajamila, Maharaja Bharata, and many others.</p>
<p>This Krsna consciousness movement is giving everyone a chance to engage in devotional service for at least some time.</p>
<p>A little service will give one an impetus to advance and thus make one’s life successful.</p>
<p>In this verse the Lord is described as Uttamasloka.</p>
<p>Uttama means the best and sloka means reputation. </p>
<p>Lord Krsna is full in six opulences, one of which is reputation.</p>
<p>Aisvaryasya samagrasya viryasya yasasah sriyah.</p>
<p>Krsna’s reputation is still expanding.</p>
<p>We are spreading the glories of Krsna by pushing forward this Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>Krsna’s reputation, five thousand years after the Battle of Kuruksetra, is still expanding throughout the world.</p>
<p>Every important individual within this world must have heard of Krsna, especially at the present moment, due to the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>Even people who do not like us and want to suppress the movement are also somehow or other chanting Hare Krsna.</p>
<p>They say, "The Hare Krsna people should be chastised."</p>
<p>Such foolish people do not realize the true value of this movement, but the mere fact that they want to criticize it gives them a chance to chant Hare Krsna, and this is its success.</p>
