<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#91" id="91">9.1</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Sudyumna became a woman and how the dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu was amalgamated with the Soma-vamsa, the dynasty coming from the moon.</p>
<p>By the desire of Maharaja Pariksit, Sukadeva Gosvami told about the dynasty of Vaivasvata Manu, who was formerly King Satyavrata, the ruler of Dravida.</p>
<p>While describing this dynasty, he also described how the Supreme Personality of Godhead, while lying down in the waters of devastation, gave birth to Lord Brahma from a lotus generated from His navel.</p>
<p>From the mind of Lord Brahma, Marici was generated, and his son was Kasyapa.</p>
<p>From Kasyapa, through Aditi, Vivasvan was generated, and from Vivasvan came Sraddhadeva Manu, who was born from the womb of Samjna.</p>
<p>Sraddhadeva’s wife, Sraddha, gave birth to ten sons, such as Iksvaku and Nrga.</p>
<p>Sraddhadeva, or Vaivasvata Manu, the father of Maharaja Iksvaku, was sonless before Iksvaku’s birth, but by the grace of the great sage Vasistha he performed a yajna to satisfy Mitra and Varuna.</p>
<p>Then, although Vaivasvata Manu wanted a son, by the desire of his wife he got a daughter named Ila.</p>
<p>Manu, however, was not satisfied with the daughter.</p>
<p>Consequently, for Manu’s satisfaction, the great sage Vasistha prayed for Ila to be transformed into a boy, and his prayer was fulfilled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus Ila became a beautiful young man named Sudyumna.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Sudyumna went on tour with his ministers.</p>
<p>At the foot of the mountain Sumeru there is a forest named Sukumara, and as soon as they entered that forest, they were all transformed into women.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami about the reason for this transformation, Sukadeva Gosvami described how Sudyumna, being transformed into a woman, accepted Budha, the son of the moon, as her husband and had a son named Pururava.</p>
<p>By the grace of Lord Siva, Sudyumna received the benediction that he would live one month as a woman and one month as a man.</p>
<p>Thus he regained his kingdom and had three sons, named Utkala, Gaya and Vimala, who were all very religious.</p>
<p>Thereafter, he entrusted his kingdom to Pururava and took the order of vanaprastha life.</p>

<p>How then has the result been opposite to the one desired? This is a matter for lamentation.</p>
<p>There should not have been such a reversal of the results of the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this age, the performance of yajna has been forbidden because no one can properly chant the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>If Vedic mantras are chanted properly, the desire for which a sacrifice is performed must be successful.</p>
<p>Therefore the Hare Krsna chant is called the maha-mantra, the great, exalted mantra above all other Vedic mantras, because simply chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra brings so many beneficial effects.</p>
<p>As explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu (Siksastaka1):</p>

<p>sarvatma-snapanam param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam</p>
<p>(Cc.Antya 20.12)</p>
<p>Glory to the Sri Krsna sankirtana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death.</p>
<p>This sankirtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon.</p>
<p>It is the life of all transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious Therefore, the best performance of yajna given to us is the sankirtana-yajna.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (Bhag.11.5.32).</p>
<p>Those who are intelligent take advantage of the greatest yajna in this age by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra in congregation.</p>
<p>When the Hare Krsna mantra is chanted by many men together, the chanting is called sankirtana, and as a result of such a yajna there will be clouds in the sky (yajnad bhavati parjanyah (Bg.3.14)).</p>
<p>In these days of drought, people can gain relief from scarcity of rain and food by the simple method of the Hare Krsna yajna.</p>
<p>Indeed, this can relieve all of human society.</p>
<p>At present there are droughts throughout Europe and America, and people are suffering, but if people take this Krsna consciousness movement seriously, if they stop their sinful activities and chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, all their problems will be solved without difficulty.</p>
<p>In other processes of yajna there are difficulties because there are no learned scholars who can chant the mantras perfectly well, nor is it possible to secure the ingredients to perform the yajna.</p>
<p>Because human society is poverty-stricken and men are devoid of Vedic knowledge and the power to chant the Vedic mantras, the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only shelter people should be intelligent enough to chant it.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (SB 11.5.32).</p>
<p>Those whose brains are dull cannot understand this chanting, nor can they take to it.</p>

<p>tatha sarirani vihaya jirnany</p>

<p>As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones The body is just like a dress, and here this is proved.</p>
<p>Sudyumna and his associates were all male, which means that their souls were covered by male dress, but now they became female, which means that their dress was changed.</p>
<p>The soul, however, remains the same.</p>
<p>It is said that by modern medical treatment a male can be transformed into a female, and a female into a male.</p>
<p>The body, however, has no connection with the soul.</p>
<p>The body can be changed, either in this life or the next.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word gotrajah is significant in this connection.</p>
<p>Brahmanas generally act as spiritual masters of two dynasties.</p>
<p>One is their disciplic succession, and the other is the dynasty born of their semen.</p>
<p>Both descendants belong to the same gotra, or dynasty.</p>
<p>In the Vedic system we sometimes find that both brahmanas and ksatriyas and even vaisyas come in the disciplic succession of the same rsis.</p>
<p>Because the gotra and dynasty are one, there is no difference between the disciples and the family born of the semen.</p>
<p>The same system still prevails in Indian society, especially in regard to marriage, for which the gotra is calculated.</p>
<p>Here the word gotrajah refers to those born in the same dynasty, whether they be disciples or members of the family.</p>

<p>Thereafter, when the time was ripe, when Sudyumna, the king of the world, was sufficiently old, he delivered the entire kingdom to his son Pururava and entered the forest.</p>

<p>According to the Vedic system, one within the institution of varna and asrama must leave his family life after he reaches fifty years of age (pancasad urdhvam vanam vrajet).</p>
<p>Thus Sudyumna followed the prescribed regulations of varnasrama by leaving the kingdom and going to the forest to complete his spiritual life.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#92" id="92">9.2</a></h3>
<p>This Second Chapter describes the dynasties of the sons of Manu, headed by Karusa.</p>
<p>After Sudyumna accepted the order of vanaprastha and departed for the forest, Vaivasvata Manu, being desirous of sons, worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead and consequently begot ten sons like Maharaja Iksvaku, all of whom were like their father.</p>
<p>One of these sons, Prsadhra, was engaged in the duty of protecting cows at night with a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Following the order of his spiritual master, he would stand in this way for the entire night.</p>
<p>Once, in the darkness of night, a tiger seized a cow from the cowshed, and when Prsadhra came to know this, he took a sword in his hand and followed the tiger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when he finally approached the tiger, he could not distinguish between the cow and the tiger in the dark, and thus he killed the cow.</p>
<p>Because of this, his spiritual master cursed him to take birth in a sudra family, but Prsadhra practiced mystic yoga, and in bhakti-yoga he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Then he voluntarily entered a blazing forest fire, thus relinquishing his material body and going back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Kavi, the youngest son of Manu, was a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from his very childhood.</p>
<p>From Manu’s son known as Karusa, a sect of ksatriyas known as Karusas was generated.</p>
<p>Manu also had a son known as Dhrsta, from whom another sect of ksatriyas was generated, but although they were born of one who had the qualities of a ksatriya, they became brahmanas.</p>
<p>From Nrga, another son of Manu, came the sons and grandsons known as Sumati, Bhutajyoti and Vasu.</p>
<p>From Vasu, in succession, came Pratika, and from him came Oghavan.</p>
<p>Descending in order from the seminal dynasty of Narisyanta, another son of Manu, were Citrasena, Rksa, Midhvan, Purna, Indrasena, Vitihotra, Satyasrava, Urusrava, Devadatta and Agnivesya.</p>
<p>From the ksatriya known as Agnivesya came the celebrated brahmana dynasty known as Agnivesyayana.</p>
<p>From the seminal dynasty of Dista, another son of Manu, came Nabhaga, and from him in succession came Bhalandana, Vatsapriti, Pramsu, Pramati, Khanitra, Caksusa, Vivimsati, Rambha, Khaninetra, Karandhama, Aviksit, Marutta, Dama, Rajyavardhana, Sudhrti, Nara, Kevala, Dhundhuman, Vegavan, Budha and Trnabindu.</p>
<p>In this way, many sons and grandsons were born in this dynasty.</p>
<p>From Trnabindu came a daughter named Ilavila, from whom Kuvera took birth.</p>
<p>Trnabindu also had three sons, named Visala, Sunyabandhu and Dhumraketu.</p>
<p>The son of Visala was Hemacandra, his son was Dhumraksa, and his son was Samyama.</p>
<p>The sons of Samyama were Devaja and Krsasva.</p>
<p>Krsasva’s son, Somadatta, performed an Asvamedha sacrifice, and by worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, he achieved the supreme perfection of going back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>One who becomes virasana takes the vow to stand all night with a sword to give protection to the cows.</p>

<p>We can further understand from this vow accepted by Prsadhra how essential it is to protect the cows.</p>
<p>Some son of a ksatriya would take this vow to protect the cows from ferocious animals, even at night.</p>

<p>Instead, you shall take birth as a sudra because of killing the cow</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that Vasistha was not free from tamo-guna, the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>As the family priest or spiritual master of Prsadhra, Vasistha should have taken Prsadhra’s offense very lightly, but instead Vasistha cursed him to become a sudra.</p>
<p>It is the duty of a family priest not to curse a disciple but to give him relief through the performance of some sort of atonement.</p>
<p>Vasistha, however, did just the opposite.</p>
<p>Therefore Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that he was durmati; in other words, his intelligence was not very good.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Prsadhra gained relief from all responsibilities, became peaceful in mind, and established control over all his senses.</p>
<p>Being unaffected by material conditions, being pleased with whatever was available by the grace of the Lord to maintain body and soul together, and being equal toward everyone, he gave full attention to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, who is the transcendental Supersoul, free from material contamination.</p>

<p>Immediately after giving up his body in the fire, he reached the spiritual world, as mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (mam eti), as a result of his devotional situation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dista had a son by the name Nabhaga.</p>
<p>This Nabhaga, who was different from the Nabhaga described later, became a vaisya by occupational duty.</p>
<p>The son of Nabhaga was known as Bhalandana, the son of Bhalandana was Vatsapriti, and his son was Pramsu.</p>
<p>Pramsu’s son was Pramati, Pramati’s son was Khanitra, Khanitra’s son was Caksusa, and his son was Vivimsati.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From Manu, one son became a ksatriya, another a brahmana, and another a vaisya.</p>
<p>This confirms the statement by Narada Muni, yasya yal laksanam proktam pumso varnabhivyanjakam (Bhag.7.11.35).</p>
<p>One should always remember that brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas should never be regarded as members of a caste by birth.</p>
<p>A brahmana may be changed into a ksatriya, and a ksatriya into a brahmana.</p>
<p>Similarly, a brahmana or ksatriya may be changed into a vaisya, and a vaisya into a brahmana or ksatriya.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>So one is a brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya never by birth, but by quality.</p>
<p>There is a great need of brahmanas.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the Krsna consciousness movement, we are trying to train some brahmanas to guide human society.</p>
<p>Because at present there is a scarcity of brahmanas, the brain of human society is lost.</p>
<p>Because practically everyone is a sudra, no one at the present moment can guide the members of society to the proper path by which to achieve perfection in life.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#93" id="93">9.3</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasty of Saryati, another son of Manu, and also tells about Sukanya and Revati.</p>
<p>Devajna Saryati gave instructions about what to do in the ritualistic ceremony observed on the second day of the yajna of the Angirasas.</p>
<p>One day, Saryati, along with his daughter, known as Sukanya, went to the asrama of Cyavana Muni.</p>
<p>There Sukanya saw two glowing substances within a hole of earthworms, and by chance she pierced those two glowing substances.</p>
<p>As soon as she did this, blood began to ooze from that hole.</p>
<p>Consequently, King Saryati and his companions suffered from constipation and inability to pass urine.</p>
<p>When the King asked why circumstances had suddenly changed, he found that Sukanya was the cause of this misfortune.</p>
<p>Then they all offered prayers to Cyavana Muni just to satisfy him according to his own desire, and Devajna Saryati offered his daughter to Cyavana Muni, who was a very old man.</p>
<p>When the heavenly physicians the Asvini-kumara brothers once visited Cyavana Muni, the muni requested them to give him back his youth.</p>
<p>These two physicians took Cyavana Muni to a particular lake, in which they bathed and regained full youth.</p>
<p>After this, Sukanya could not distinguish her husband.</p>
<p>She then surrendered unto the Asvini-kumaras, who were very satisfied with her chastity and who therefore introduced her again to her husband.</p>
<p>Cyavana Muni then engaged King Saryati in performing the soma-yajna and gave the Asvini-kumaras the privilege to drink soma-rasa.</p>
<p>The King of heaven, Lord Indra, became very angry at this, but he could do no harm to Saryati.</p>
<p>Henceforward, the Asvini-kumara physicians were able to share in the soma-rasa.</p>
<p>Saryati later had three sons, named Uttanabarhi, Anarta and Bhurisena.</p>
<p>Anarta had one son, whose name was Revata.</p>
<p>Revata had one hundred sons, of whom the eldest was Kakudmi.</p>
<p>Kakudmi was advised by Lord Brahma to offer his beautiful daughter, Revati, to Baladeva, who belongs to the visnu-tattva category.</p>
<p>After doing this, Kakudmi retired from family life and entered the forest of Badarikasrama to execute austerities and penances.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Cyavana Muni was very irritable, but since Sukanya had gotten him as her husband, she dealt with him carefully, according to his mood.</p>
<p>Knowing his mind, she performed service to him without being bewildered.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is an indication of the relationship between husband and wife.</p>
<p>A great personality like Cyavana Muni has the temperament of always wanting to be in a superior position.</p>
<p>Such a person cannot submit to anyone.</p>
<p>Therefore, Cyavana Muni had an irritable temperament.</p>
<p>His wife, Sukanya, could understand his attitude, and under the circumstances she treated him accordingly.</p>
<p>If any wife wants to be happy with her husband, she must try to understand her husband’s temperament and please him.</p>
<p>This is victory for a woman.</p>
<p>Even in the dealings of Lord Krsna with His different queens, it has been seen that although the queens were the daughters of great kings, they placed themselves before Lord Krsna as His maidservants.</p>
<p>However great a woman may be, she must place herself before her husband in this way; that is to say, she must be ready to carry out her husband’s orders and please him in all circumstances.</p>
<p>Then her life will be successful.</p>
<p>When the wife becomes as irritable as the husband, their life at home is sure to be disturbed or ultimately completely broken.</p>
<p>In the modern day, the wife is never submissive, and therefore home life is broken even by slight incidents.</p>
<p>Either the wife or the husband may take advantage of the divorce laws.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic law, however, there is no such thing as divorce laws, and a woman must be trained to be submissive to the will of her husband.</p>
<p>Westerners contend that this is a slave mentality for the wife, but factually it is not; it is the tactic by which a woman can conquer the heart of her husband, however irritable or cruel he may be.</p>
<p>In this case we clearly see that although Cyavana Muni was not young but indeed old enough to be Sukanya’s grandfather and was also very irritable, Sukanya, the beautiful young daughter of a king, submitted herself to her old husband and tried to please him in all respects.</p>
<p>Thus she was a faithful and chaste wife.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kasyacit—after some (time); tu—but; atha—in this way; kalasya—time having passed; nasatyau—the two Asvini-kumaras; asrama—that place of Cyavana Muni; agatau—reached; tau—unto those two; pujayitva—offering respectful obeisances; provaca—said; vayah—youth; me—unto me; dattam—please give; isvarau—because you two are able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, some time having passed, the Asvini-kumara brothers, the heavenly physicians, happened to come to Cyavana Muni’s asrama.</p>
<p>After offering them respectful obeisances, Cyavana Muni requested them to give him youthful life, for they were able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The heavenly physicians like the Asvini-kumaras could give youthful life even to one who was advanced in age.</p>
<p>Indeed, great yogis, with their mystic powers, can even bring a dead body back to life if the structure of the body is in order.</p>
<p>We have already discussed this in connection with Bali Maharaja’s soldiers and their treatment by Sukracarya.</p>
<p>Modern medical science has not yet discovered how to bring a dead body back to life or bring youthful energy to an old body, but from these verses we can understand that such treatment is possible if one is able to take knowledge from the Vedic information.</p>
<p>The Asvini-kumaras were expert in Ayur-veda, as was Dhanvantari.</p>
<p>In every department of material science, there is a perfection to be achieved, and to achieve it one must consult the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>The highest perfection is to become a devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>To attain this perfection, one must consult Srimad-Bhagavatam, which is understood to be the ripe fruit of the Vedic desire tree (nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam (SB 1.1.3)).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O unchaste girl, what is this that you have desired to do? You have cheated the most respectable husband, who is honored by everyone, for I see that because he was old, diseased and therefore unattractive, you have left his company to accept as your husband this young man, who appears to be a beggar from the street.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This shows the values of Vedic culture.</p>
<p>According to the circumstances, Sukanya had been given a husband who was too old to be compatible with her.</p>
<p>Because Cyavana Muni was diseased and very old, he was certainly unfit for the beautiful daughter of King Saryati.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, her father expected her to be faithful to her husband.</p>
<p>When he suddenly saw that his daughter had accepted someone else, even though the man was young and handsome, he immediately chastised her as asati, unchaste, because he assumed that she had accepted another man in the presence of her husband.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, even if a young woman is given an old husband, she must respectfully serve him.</p>
<p>This is chastity.</p>
<p>It is not that because she dislikes her husband she may give him up and accept another.</p>
<p>This is against Vedic culture.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, a woman must accept the husband given to her by her parents and remain chaste and faithful to him.</p>
<p>Therefore King Saryati was surprised to see a young man by the side of Sukanya.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my daughter, who were born in a respectable family, how have you degraded your consciousness in this way? How is it that you are shamelessly maintaining a paramour? You will thus degrade the dynasties of both your father and your husband to hellish life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is quite clear that according to Vedic culture a woman who accepts a paramour or second husband in the presence of the husband she has married is certainly responsible for the degradation of her father’s family and the family of her husband.</p>
<p>The rules of Vedic culture in this regard are strictly observed in the respectable families of brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas even today; only the sudras are degraded in this matter.</p>
<p>For a woman of the brahmana, ksatriya or vaisya class to accept another husband in the presence of the husband she has married, or to file for divorce or accept a boyfriend or paramour, is unacceptable in the Vedic culture.</p>
<p>Therefore King Saryati, who did not know the real facts of Cyavana Muni’s transformation, was surprised to see the behavior of his daughter.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-2" id="summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#94" id="94">9.4</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the history of Maharaja Nabhaga, of his son Nabhaga, and of Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>The son of Manu was Nabhaga, and his son Nabhaga lived for many years in the gurukula.</p>
<p>In Nabhaga’s absence, his brothers did not consider his share of the kingdom, but instead divided the property among themselves.</p>
<p>When Nabhaga returned home, his brothers bestowed upon him their father as his share, but when Nabhaga went to his father and told him about the dealings of the brothers, his father informed him that this was cheating and advised him that for his livelihood he should go to the sacrificial arena and describe two mantras to be chanted there.</p>
<p>Nabhaga executed the order of his father, and thus Angira and other great saintly persons gave him all the money collected in that sacrifice.</p>
<p>To test Nabhaga, Lord Siva challenged his claim to the wealth, but when Lord Siva was satisfied by Nabhaga’s behavior, Lord Siva offered him all the riches.</p>
<p>From Nabhaga was born Ambarisa, the most powerful and celebrated devotee.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa was the emperor of the entire world, but he considered his opulence temporary.</p>
<p>Indeed, knowing that such material opulence is the cause of downfall into conditional life, he was unattached to this opulence.</p>
<p>He engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This process is called yukta-vairagya, or feasible renunciation, which is quite suitable for worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Because Maharaja Ambarisa, as the emperor, was immensely opulent, he performed devotional service with great opulence, and therefore, despite his wealth, he had no attachment to his wife, children or kingdom.</p>
<p>He constantly engaged his senses and mind in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, to say nothing of enjoying material opulence, he never desired even liberation.</p>
<p>Once Maharaja Ambarisa was worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vrndavana, observing the vow of Dvadasi.</p>
<p>On Dvadasi, the day after Ekadasi, when he was about to break his Ekadasi fast, the great mystic yogi Durvasa appeared in his house and became his guest.</p>
<p>King Ambarisa respectfully received Durvasa Muni, and Durvasa Muni, after accepting his invitation to eat there, went to bathe in the Yamuna River at noontime.</p>
<p>Because he was absorbed in samadhi, he did not come back very soon.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa, however, upon seeing that the time to break the fast was passing, drank a little water, in accordance with the advice of learned brahmanas, just to observe the formality of breaking the fast.</p>
<p>By mystic power, Durvasa Muni could understand that this had happened, and he was very angry.</p>
<p>When he returned he began to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa, but he was not satisfied, and finally he created from his hair a demon appearing like the fire of death.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is always the protector of His devotee, and to protect Maharaja Ambarisa, He sent His disc, the Sudarsana cakra, which immediately vanquished the fiery demon and then pursued Durvasa, who was so envious of Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>Durvasa fled to Brahmaloka, Sivaloka and all the other higher planets, but he could not protect himself from the wrath of the Sudarsana cakra.</p>
<p>Finally he went to the spiritual world and surrendered to Lord Narayana, but Lord Narayana could not excuse a person who had offended a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>To be excused from such an offense, one must submit to the Vaisnava whom he has offended.</p>
<p>There is no other way to be excused.</p>
<p>Thus Lord Narayana advised Durvasa to return to Maharaja Ambarisa and beg his pardon.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: The son of Nabhaga named Nabhaga lived for a long time at the place of his spiritual master.</p>
<p>Therefore, his brothers thought that he was not going to become a grhastha and would not return.</p>
<p>Consequently, without providing a share for him, they divided the property of their father among themselves.</p>
<p>When Nabhaga returned from the place of his spiritual master, they gave him their father as his share.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two kinds of brahmacaris.</p>
<p>One may return home, marry and become a householder, whereas the other, known as brhad-vrata, takes a vow to remain a brahmacari perpetually.</p>
<p>The brhad-vrata brahmacari does not return from the place of the spiritual master; he stays there, and later he directly takes sannyasa.</p>
<p>Because Nabhaga did not return from the place of his spiritual master, his brothers thought that he had taken brhadvrata-brahmacarya.</p>
<p>Therefore, they did not preserve his share, and when he returned they gave him their father as his share.</p>

<p>Nabhaga was very simple hearted.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: Maharaja Ambarisa, the most fortunate personality, achieved the rule of the entire world, consisting of seven islands, and achieved inexhaustible, unlimited opulence and prosperity on earth.</p>
<p>Although such a position is rarely obtained, Maharaja Ambarisa did not care for it at all, for he knew very well that all such opulence is material.</p>
<p>Like that which is imagined in a dream, such opulence will ultimately be destroyed.</p>
<p>The King knew that any nondevotee who attains such opulence merges increasingly into material nature’s mode of darkness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>For a devotee material opulence is insignificant, whereas for a nondevotee material opulence is the cause of increasing bondage, for a devotee knows that anything material is temporary, whereas a nondevotee regards the temporary so-called happiness as everything and forgets the path of self-realization.</p>
<p>Thus for the nondevotee material opulence is a disqualification for spiritual advancement.</p>

<p>He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Krsna, Krsna’s temples and Krsna’s places like Mathura and Vrndavana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord’s devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasi offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord’s prasada.</p>
<p>He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and all his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day.</p>
<p>Indeed, Maharaja Ambarisa never desired anything for his own sense gratification.</p>
<p>He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (7.1) the Lord recommends, mayy asakta-manah partha yogam yunjan mad-asrayah.</p>
<p>This indicates that one must execute devotional service under the guidance of a devotee or directly under the guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is not possible, however, to train oneself without guidance from the spiritual master.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the instructions of Srila Rupa Gosvami, the first business of a devotee is to accept a bona fide spiritual master who can train him to engage his various senses in rendering transcendental service to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gita (7.1), asamsayam samagram mam yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu.</p>
<p>In other words, if one wants to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead in completeness, one must follow the prescriptions given by Krsna by following in the footsteps of Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>It is said, hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate: (Cc.Madhya 19.170) bhakti means to engage the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Krsna, who is called Hrsikesa or Acyuta.</p>
<p>These words are used in these verses.</p>
<p>Acyuta-sat-kathodaye, hrsikesa-padabhivandane.</p>
<p>The words Acyuta and Hrsikesa are also used in Bhagavad-gita.Bhagavad-gita is krsna-katha spoken directly by Krsna, and Srimad-Bhagavatam is also krsna-katha because everything described in the Bhagavatam is in relationship with Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>evam—thus (living a devotional life); sada—always; karma-kalapam—the prescribed occupational duties as a ksatriya king; atmanah—of himself, personally (the head of the state); pare—unto the supreme transcendence; adhiyajne—unto the supreme proprietor, the supreme enjoyer; bhagavati—unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adhoksaje—unto He who is beyond material sense perception; sarva-atma-bhavam—all different varieties of devotional service; vidadhat—executing, offering; mahim—the planet earth; imam—this; tat-nistha—who are faithful devotees of the Lord; vipra—by such brahmanas; abhihitah—directed; sasasa—ruled; ha—in the past.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In performing his prescribed duties as king, Maharaja Ambarisa always offered the results of his royal activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who is the enjoyer of everything and is beyond the perception of material senses.</p>
<p>He certainly took advice from brahmanas who were faithful devotees of the Lord, and thus he ruled the planet earth without difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (5.29):</p>
<p>bhoktaram yajna-tapasam</p>
<p>sarva-loka-mahesvaram</p>
<p>suhrdam sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>jnatva mam santim rcchati</p>
<p>People are very much anxious to live in peace and prosperity in this material world, and here in Bhagavad-gita the peace formula is given personally by the Supreme Personality of Godhead: everyone should understand that Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate proprietor of all the planets and is therefore the enjoyer of all activities, political, social, cultural, religious, economic and so on.</p>
<p>The Lord has given perfect advice in Bhagavad-gita, and Ambarisa Maharaja, as the ideal executive head, ruled the entire world as a Vaisnava, taking advice from Vaisnava brahmanas.</p>
<p>The sastras enjoin that even though a brahmana may be well versed in the occupational brahminical duties and may be very learned in Vedic knowledge, he cannot give advice as a guru until he is a Vaisnava sat-karma-nipuno vipro</p>
<p>mantra-tantra-visaradah</p>
<p>avaisnavo gurur na syad</p>
<p>vaisnavah sva-paco guruh</p>
<p>Therefore, as indicated here by the words tan-nistha-viprabhihitah, Maharaja Ambarisa took advice from brahmanas who were pure devotees of the Lord, for ordinary brahmanas who are merely learned scholars or experts in performing ritualistic ceremonies are not competent to give advice.</p>
<p>In modern times, there are legislative assemblies whose members are authorized to make laws for the welfare of the state, but according to this description of the kingdom of Maharaja Ambarisa, the country or the world should be ruled by a chief executive whose advisors are all devotee brahmanas.</p>
<p>Such advisors or members of the legislative assembly should not be professional politicians, nor should they be selected by the ignorant public.</p>
<p>Rather, they should be appointed by the king.</p>
<p>When the king, the executive head of the state, is a devotee and he follows the instructions of devotee brahmanas in ruling the country, everyone will be peaceful and prosperous.</p>
<p>When the king and his advisors are perfect devotees, nothing can be wrong in the state.</p>
<p>All the citizens should become devotees of the Lord, and then their good character will automatically follow yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana</p>
<p>sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah</p>
<p>harav abhaktasya kuto mahad-guna</p>
<p>manorathenasati dhavato bahih</p>
<p>One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods.</p>
<p>But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value.</p>
<p>This is because he is hovering on the mental plane and is certain to be attracted by the glaring material energy (Bhag.5.18.12) Citizens under the guidance of a Krsna conscious king will become devotees, and then there will be no need to enact new laws every day to reform the way of life in the state.</p>
<p>If the citizens are trained to become devotees, they will automatically become peaceful and honest, and if they are guided by a devoted king advised by devotees, the state will not be in the material world but in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>All the states of the world should therefore follow the ideal of the rule or administration of Maharaja Ambarisa, as described here.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In desert countries where there flowed the River Sarasvati, Maharaja Ambarisa performed great sacrifices like the asvamedha-yajna and thus satisfied the master of all yajnas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Such sacrifices were performed with great opulence and suitable paraphernalia and with contributions of daksina to the brahmanas, who were supervised by great personalities like Vasistha, Asita and Gautama, representing the king, the performer of the sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When one performs ritualistic sacrifices as prescribed in the Vedas, one needs expert brahmanas known as yajnika-brahmanas.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, however, there is a scarcity of such brahmanas.</p>
<p>Therefore in Kali-yuga the sacrifice recommended in sastra is sankirtana-yajna (yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (SB 11.5.32)).</p>
<p>Instead of spending money unnecessarily on performing yajnas impossible to perform in this age of Kali because of the scarcity of yajnika-brahmanas, one who is intelligent performs sankirtana-yajna.</p>
<p>Without properly performed yajnas to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be scarcity of rain (yajnad bhavati parjanyah (Bg.3.14)).</p>
<p>Therefore the performance of yajna is essential.</p>
<p>Without yajna there will be a scarcity of rain, and because of this scarcity, no food grains will be produced, and there will be famines.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the king, therefore, to perform different types of yajnas, such as the asvamedha-yajna, to maintain the production of food grains.</p>
<p>Annad bhavanti bhutani.</p>
<p>Without food grains, both men and animals will starve.</p>
<p>Therefore yajna is necessary for the state to perform because by yajna the people in general will be fed sumptuously.</p>
<p>The brahmanas and yajnika priests should be sufficiently paid for their expert service.</p>
<p>This payment is called daksina.</p>
<p>Ambarisa Maharaja, as the head of the state, performed all these yajnas through great personalities like Vasistha, Gautama and Asita.</p>
<p>Personally, however, he was engaged in devotional service, as mentioned before (sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayoh).</p>
<p>The king or head of state must see that things go on well under proper guidance, and he must be an ideal devotee, as exemplified by Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the king to see that food grains are produced even in desert countries, what to speak of elsewhere.</p>

<p>The citizens of the state of Maharaja Ambarisa were accustomed to chanting and hearing about the glorious activities of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus they never aspired to be elevated to the heavenly planets, which are extremely dear even to the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A pure devotee who has been trained in the practice of chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord and His fame, qualities, form, paraphernalia and so on is never interested in elevation to the heavenly planets, even though such places are extremely dear even to the demigods narayana-parah sarve</p>

<p>The heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same to a devotee (Bhag.6.17.28) A devotee is always situated in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Therefore he does not desire anything.</p>
<p>He is known as akama, or desireless, because he has nothing to desire except to render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Because Maharaja Ambarisa was a most exalted devotee of the Lord, he trained his subjects in such a way that the citizens in his state were not interested in anything material, including even the happiness of the heavenly planets.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those who are saturated with the transcendental happiness of rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead are uninterested even in the achievements of great mystics, for such achievements do not enhance the transcendental bliss felt by a devotee who always thinks of Krsna within the core of his heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A pure devotee is uninterested not only in elevation to the higher planetary systems but even in the perfections of mystic yoga.</p>
<p>Real perfection is devotional service.</p>
<p>The happiness derived from merging in the impersonal Brahman and the happiness derived from the eight perfections of mystic yoga (anima, laghima, prapti and so on) do not give any pleasure to the devotee.</p>
<p>As stated by Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati:</p>
<p>kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate</p>
<p>durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate</p>
<p>visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate</p>
<p>yat karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah</p>
<p>(Caitanya-candramrta5)</p>
<p>When a devotee has achieved the position of rendering transcendental loving service to the Lord through the mercy of Lord Caitanya, he thinks the impersonal Brahman to be no better than hell, and he regards material happiness in the heavenly planets to be like a will-o’-the-wisp.</p>
<p>As far as the perfection of mystic powers is concerned, a devotee compares it to a venomous snake with no teeth.</p>
<p>A mystic yogi is especially concerned with controlling the senses, but because the senses of a devotee are engaged in the service of the Lord (hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate (Cc.Madhya 19.170)) there is no need for separate control of the senses.</p>
<p>For those who are materially engaged, control of the senses is required, but a devotee’s senses are all engaged in the service of the Lord, which means that they are already controlled param drstva nivartate (Bg.2.59).</p>
<p>A devotee’s senses are not attracted by material enjoyment.</p>
<p>And even though the material world is full of misery, the devotee considers this material world to be also spiritual because everything is engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>The difference between the spiritual world and material world is the mentality of service.</p>
<p>Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate.</p>
<p>When there is no mentality of service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one’s activities are material prapanci-kataya buddhya</p>

<p>mumuksubhih parityago</p>
<p>vairagyam phalgu kathyate</p>
<p>(Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu1.2.256)</p>
<p>That which is not engaged in the service of the Lord is material, and nothing thus engaged should be given up.</p>
<p>In the construction of a high skyscraper and the construction of a temple, there may be the same enthusiasm, but the endeavors are different, for one is material and the other spiritual.</p>
<p>Spiritual activities should not be confused with material activities and given up.</p>
<p>Nothing connected with Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is material.</p>
<p>A devotee who considers all this is always situated in spiritual activities, and therefore he is no longer attracted by material activities (param drstva nivartate).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The king of this planet, Maharaja Ambarisa, thus performed devotional service to the Lord and in this endeavor practiced severe austerity.</p>
<p>Always satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his constitutional activities, he gradually gave up all material desires.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Severe austerities in the practice of devotional service are of many varieties.</p>
<p>For example, in worshiping the Deity in the temple there are certainly laborious activities.</p>
<p>Sri-vigraharadhana-nitya-nana srngara-tan-mandira-marjanadau .</p>
<p>One must decorate the Deity, cleanse the temple, bring water from the Ganges and Yamuna, continue the routine work, perform arati many times, prepare first-class food for the Deity, prepare dresses and so on.</p>
<p>In this way, one must constantly be engaged in various activities, and the hard labor involved is certainly an austerity.</p>
<p>Similarly, the hard labor involved in preaching, preparing literature, preaching to atheistic men and distributing literature door to door is of course an austerity (tapo-yuktena).</p>
<p>Tapo divyam putraka.</p>
<p>Such austerity is necessary.</p>
<p>Yena sattvam suddhyet.</p>
<p>By such austerity in devotional service, one is purified of material existence (kaman sanair jahau).</p>
<p>Indeed, such austerity leads one to the constitutional position of devotional service.</p>
<p>In this way one can give up material desires, and as soon as one is freed from material desires, he is free from the repetition of birth and death, old age and disease.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Maharaja Ambarisa satisfied all the guests who arrived at his house, especially the brahmanas.</p>
<p>He gave in charity sixty crores of cows whose horns were covered with gold plate and whose hooves were covered with silver plate.</p>
<p>All the cows were well decorated with garments and had full milk bags.</p>
<p>They were mild-natured, young and beautiful and were accompanied by their calves.</p>
<p>After giving these cows, the King first sumptuously fed all the brahmanas, and when they were fully satisfied, he was about to observe the end of Ekadasi, with their permission, by breaking the fast.</p>

<p>In the meantime, only a muhurta of the Dvadasi day was left on which to break the fast.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The King said: To transgress the laws of respectful behavior toward the brahmanas is certainly a great offense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if one does not observe the breaking of the fast within the time of Dvadasi, there is a flaw in one’s observance of the vow.</p>
<p>Therefore, O brahmanas, if you think that it will be auspicious and not irreligious, I shall break the fast by drinking water In this way, after consulting with the brahmanas, the King reached this decision, for according to brahminical opinion, drinking water may be accepted as eating and also as not eating.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Maharaja Ambarisa, in his dilemma, consulted the brahmanas about whether he should break the fast or wait for Durvasa Muni, apparently they could not give a definite answer about what to do.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava, however, is the most intelligent personality.</p>
<p>Therefore Maharaja Ambarisa himself decided, in the presence of the brahmanas, that he would drink a little water, for this would confirm that the fast was broken but would not transgress the laws for receiving a brahmana.</p>
<p>In the Vedas it is said, apo ’snati tan naivasitam naivanasitam.</p>
<p>This Vedic injunction declares that the drinking of water may be accepted as eating or as not eating.</p>
<p>Sometimes in our practical experience we see that some political leader adhering to satyagraha will not eat but will drink water.</p>
<p>Considering that drinking water would not be eating, Maharaja Ambarisa decided to act in this way.</p>

<p>Being proud of his material opulence and his position, he considers himself God.</p>
<p>Just see how he has transgressed the laws of religion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has diverted the entire meaning of this verse as spoken by Durvasa Muni.</p>
<p>Durvasa Muni used the word nr-samsasya to indicate that the King was cruel, but Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura interprets it to mean that the King’s character was glorified by all the local people.</p>
<p>He says that the word nr means by all the local peopl and that samsasya means of he (Ambarisa) whose character was glorified Similarly, one who is very rich becomes mad because of his wealth and is therefore called sriya-unmattasya, but Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura interprets these words to mean that although Maharaja Ambarisa was such an opulent king, he was not mad after money, for he had already surpassed the madness of material opulence.</p>
<p>Similarly, the word isa-maninah is interpreted to mean that he was so respectful to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that he did not transgress the laws for observing Ekadasi-parana, despite the thinking of Durvasa Muni, for he only took water.</p>
<p>In this way, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura has supported Ambarisa Maharaja and all his activities.</p>

<p>A devotee cannot be defeated by a so-called mystic yogi.</p>

<p>Therefore, following the examples of Ambarisa Maharaja and Prahlada Maharaja, a devotee should learn how to tolerate all such awkward positions in this world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As fire in the forest immediately burns to ashes an angry snake, so, by the previous order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His disc, the Sudarsana cakra, immediately burnt to ashes the created demon to protect the Lord’s devotee.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa, although in such danger, did not move an inch from his position, nor did he request the Supreme Personality of Godhead to give him protection.</p>
<p>He was fixed in understanding, and it was certain that he was simply thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the core of his heart.</p>
<p>A devotee is never fearful of his death, for he meditates on the Supreme Personality of Godhead always, not for any material profit, but as his duty.</p>
<p>The Lord, however, knows how to protect His devotee.</p>
<p>As indicated by the words prag distam, the Lord knew everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, before anything happened, He had already arranged for His cakra to protect Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>This protection is offered to a devotee even from the very beginning of his devotional service.</p>
<p>Kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati (Bg.9.31).</p>
<p>If one simply begins devotional service, he is immediately protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.66): aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami.</p>
<p>Protection begins immediately.</p>
<p>The Lord is so kind and merciful that He gives the devotee proper guidance and all protection, and thus the devotee very peacefully makes solid progress in Krsna consciousness without outward disturbances.</p>
<p>A serpent may be very angry and ready to bite, but the furious snake is helpless when faced by a blazing fire in the forest.</p>
<p>Although an enemy of a devotee may be very strong, he is compared to an angry serpent before the fire of devotional service.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said to the brahmana: I am completely under the control of My devotees.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am not at all independent.</p>
<p>Because My devotees are completely devoid of material desires, I sit only within the cores of their hearts.</p>
<p>What to speak of My devotee, even those who are devotees of My devotee are very dear to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>All the great stalwart personalities in the universe, including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, are fully under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is fully under the control of His devotee.</p>
<p>Why is this? Because the devotee is anyabhilasita-sunya; in other words, he has no material desires in his heart.</p>
<p>His only desire is to think always of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and how to serve Him best.</p>
<p>Because of this transcendental qualification, the Supreme Lord is extremely favorable to the devotees—indeed, not only the devotees, but also the devotees of the devotees.</p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura says, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: without being a devotee of a devotee, one cannot be released from material entanglement.</p>
<p>Therefore Caitanya Mahaprabhu identified Himself as gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah.</p>
<p>Thus he instructed us to become not directly servants of Krsna but servants of the servant of Krsna.</p>
<p>Devotees like Brahma, Narada, Vyasadeva and Sukadeva Gosvami are directly servants of Krsna, and one who becomes a servant of Narada, Vyasadeva and Sukadeva, like the six Gosvamis, is still more devoted.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura therefore says, yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah:  if one very sincerely serves the spiritual master, Krsna certainly becomes favorable to such a devotee.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of a devotee is more valuable than following the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O best of the brahmanas, without saintly persons for whom I am the only destination, I do not desire to enjoy My transcendental bliss and My supreme opulences.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is self-sufficient, but to enjoy His transcendental bliss He requires the cooperation of His devotees.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana, for example, although Lord Krsna is full in Himself, He wants the cooperation of His devotees like the cowherd boys and the gopis to increase His transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>Such pure devotees, who can increase the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are certainly most dear to Him.</p>
<p>Not only does the Supreme Personality of Godhead enjoy the company of His devotees, but because He is unlimited He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly.</p>
<p>Thus, He descends to the material world to induce the nondevotees and rebellious living entities to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>He requests them to surrender unto Him because, unlimited as He is, He wants to increase His devotees unlimitedly.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is an attempt to increase the number of pure devotees of the Supreme Lord more and more.</p>
<p>It is certain that a devotee who helps in this endeavor to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes indirectly a controller of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Although the Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, He does not feel transcendental bliss without His devotees.</p>
<p>An example that may be cited in this regard is that if a very rich man does not have sons in a family he does not feel happiness.</p>
<p>Indeed, sometimes a rich man adopts a son to complete his happiness.</p>
<p>The science of transcendental bliss is known to the pure devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore the pure devotee is always engaged in increasing the transcendental happiness of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Since pure devotees give up their homes, wives, children, relatives, riches and even their lives simply to serve Me, without any desire for material improvement in this life or in the next, how can I give up such devotees at any time?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped by the words brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca.</p>
<p>Thus He is the well-wisher of the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Durvasa Muni was certainly a very great brahmana, but because he was a nondevotee, he could not sacrifice everything in devotional service.</p>
<p>Great mystic yogis are actually self-interested.</p>
<p>The proof is that when Durvasa Muni created a demon to kill Maharaja Ambarisa, the King stayed fixed in his place, praying to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and depending solely and wholly on Him, whereas when Durvasa Muni was chased by the Sudarsana cakra by the supreme will of the Lord, he was so perturbed that he fled all over the world and tried to take shelter in every nook and corner of the universe.</p>
<p>At last, in fear of his life, he approached Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He was so interested in his own body that he wanted to kill the body of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Therefore, he did not have very good intelligence, and how can an unintelligent person be delivered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The Lord certainly tries to give all protection to His devotees who have given up everything for the sake of serving Him.</p>
<p>Another point in this verse is that attachment to daragara-putrapta—home, wife, children, friendship, society and love—is not the way to achieve the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One who is attached to hearth and home for material pleasure cannot become a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Sometimes a pure devotee may have a habit or attraction for wife, children and home but at the same time want to serve the Supreme Lord to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>For such a devotee, the Lord makes a special arrangement to take away the objects of his false attachment and thus free him from attachment to wife, home, children, friends and so on.</p>
<p>This is special mercy bestowed upon the devotee to bring him back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As chaste women bring their gentle husbands under control by service, the pure devotees, who are equal to everyone and completely attached to Me in the core of the heart, bring Me under their full control.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, the word sama-darsanah is significant.</p>
<p>The pure devotee is actually equal toward everyone, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.54): brahma-bhutah prasannatma na socati na kanksati/ samah sarvesu bhutesu.</p>
<p>Universal brotherhood is possible when one is a pure devotee (panditah sama-darsinah (Bg.5.18)).</p>
<p>A pure devotee is actually learned because he knows his constitutional position, he knows the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he knows the relationship between the living entity and the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Thus he has full spiritual knowledge and is automatically liberated (brahma-bhutah).</p>
<p>He can therefore see everyone on the spiritual platform.</p>
<p>He can comprehend the happiness and distress of all living entities.</p>
<p>He understands that what is happiness to him is also happiness to others and that what is distress to him is distressing for others.</p>
<p>Therefore he is sympathetic to everyone.</p>
<p>As Prahlada Maharaja said:</p>
<p>soce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyartha-</p>
<p>maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan</p>
<p>(Bhag.7.9.43)</p>
<p>People suffer from material distress because they are not attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>A pure devotee’s chief concern, therefore, is to raise the ignorant mass of people to the sense of Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>

<p>What then is to be said of such perishable happiness as elevation to the higher planetary systems?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>

<p>muktih svayam mukulitanjalih sevate ’sman</p>
<p>dharmartha-kama-gatayah samaya-pratiksah</p>
<p>Bilvamangala Thakura realized that if one develops his natural devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, mukti stands before him with folded hands to offer all kinds of service.</p>
<p>In other words, the devotee is already liberated.</p>
<p>There is no need for him to aspire for different types of liberation.</p>
<p>The pure devotee automatically achieves liberation, even without desiring it.</p>

<p>My devotees do not know anything else but Me, and I do not know anyone else but them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Durvasa Muni wanted to chastise Maharaja Ambarisa, it is to be understood that he wanted to give pain to the heart of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for the Lord says, sadhavo hrdayam mahyam: The pure devotee is always within the core of My heart The Lord’s feelings are like those of a father, who feels pain when his child is in pain.</p>
<p>Therefore, offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee are serious.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu has very strongly recommended that one not commit any offense at the lotus feet of a devotee.</p>
<p>Such offenses are compared to a mad elephant because when a mad elephant enters a garden it causes devastation.</p>
<p>Therefore one should be extremely careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Actually Maharaja Ambarisa was not at all at fault; Durvasa Muni unnecessarily wanted to chastise him on flimsy grounds.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa wanted to complete the Ekadasi-parana as part of devotional service to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he drank a little water.</p>
<p>But although Durvasa Muni was a great mystic brahmana, he did not know what is what.</p>
<p>That is the difference between a pure devotee and a so-called learned scholar of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>The devotees, being always situated in the core of the Lord’s heart, surely get all instructions directly from the Lord, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.11):</p>
<p>tesam evanukampartham</p>
<p>aham ajnana-jam tamah</p>
<p>nasayamy atma-bhavastho</p>
<p>jnana-dipena bhasvata</p>
<p>Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance The devotee does not do anything not sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As it is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya.</p>
<p>Even the most learned or experienced person cannot understand the movements of a Vaisnava, a pure devotee.</p>
<p>No one, therefore, should criticize a pure Vaisnava.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava knows his own business; whatever he does is precisely right because he is always guided by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>O brahmana, let Me now advise you for your own protection.</p>
<p>Please hear from Me.</p>
<p>By offending Maharaja Ambarisa, you have acted with self-envy.</p>
<p>Therefore you should go to him immediately, without a moment’s delay.</p>
<p>One’s so-called prowess, when employed against the devotee, certainly harms he who employs it.</p>
<p>Thus it is the subject, not the object, who is harmed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A Vaisnava is always an object of envy for nondevotees, even when the nondevotee happens to be his father.</p>
<p>To give a practical example, Hiranyakasipu was envious of Prahlada Maharaja, but this envy of the devotee was harmful to Hiranyakasipu, not to Prahlada.</p>
<p>Every action taken by Hiranyakasipu against his son Prahlada Maharaja was taken very seriously by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus when Hiranyakasipu was on the verge of killing Prahlada, the Lord personally appeared and killed Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Service to a Vaisnava gradually accumulates and becomes an asset for the devotee.</p>
<p>Similarly, harmful activities directed against the devotee gradually become the ultimate cause of the performer’s falldown.</p>
<p>Even such a great brahmana and mystic yogi as Durvasa was in a most dangerous situation because of his offense at the lotus feet of Maharaja Ambarisa, a pure devotee.</p>

<p>Durvasa Muni was a very learned brahmana equipped with mystic power, but because he was not a gentleman, he did not know how to use his power.</p>
<p>He was therefore extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is never inclined toward a dangerous person who uses his mystic power for some personal design.</p>
<p>By the laws of nature, therefore, such misuse of power is ultimately dangerous not for society but for the person who misuses it.</p>

<p>The lesson to be derived from this narration concerning Maharaja Ambarisa and Durvasa Muni is that all the demigods, including Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, are under the control of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a Vaisnava is offended, the offender is punished by Visnu, the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>No one can protect such a person, even Lord Brahma or Lord Siva.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-3" id="summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#95" id="95">9.5</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter we find Maharaja Ambarisa offering prayers to the Sudarsana cakra and we find how the Sudarsana cakra became merciful to Durvasa Muni.</p>
<p>By the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, Durvasa Muni immediately went to Maharaja Ambarisa and fell at his lotus feet.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa, being naturally very humble and meek, felt shy and ashamed because Durvasa Muni had fallen at his feet, and thus he began to offer prayers to the Sudarsana cakra just to save Durvasa.</p>
<p>What is this Sudarsana cakra? The Sudarsana cakra is the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by which He creates the entire material world.</p>
<p>Sa aiksata, sa asrjata.</p>
<p>This is the Vedic version.</p>
<p>The Sudarsana cakra, which is the origin of creation and is most dear to the Lord, has thousands of spokes.</p>
<p>This Sudarsana cakra is the killer of the prowess of all other weapons, the killer of darkness, and the manifester of the prowess of devotional service; it is the means of establishing religious principles, and it is the killer of all irreligious activities.</p>
<p>Without his mercy, the universe cannot be maintained, and therefore the Sudarsana cakra is employed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Ambarisa thus prayed that the Sudarsana cakra be merciful, the Sudarsana cakra, being appeased, refrained from killing Durvasa Muni, who thus achieved the Sudarsana cakra’s mercy.</p>
<p>Durvasa Muni thus learned to give up the nasty idea of considering a Vaisnava an ordinary person (vaisnave jati-buddhi).</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa belonged to the ksatriya group, and therefore Durvasa Muni considered him lower than the brahmanas and wanted to exercise brahminical power against him.</p>
<p>By this incident, everyone should learn how to stop mischievous ideas of neglecting Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>After this incident, Maharaja Ambarisa gave Durvasa Muni sumptuous food to eat, and then the King, who had been standing in the same place for one year without eating anything, also took prasada.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa later divided his property among his sons and went to the bank of the Manasa-sarovara to execute devotional meditation.</p>

<p>The word sudarsana means auspicious vision From Vedic instructions we understand that this material world is created by the glance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sa aiksata, sa asrjata).</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead glanced over the mahat-tattva, or the total material energy, and when it was agitated, everything came into existence.</p>
<p>Western philosophers sometimes think that the original cause of creation was a chunk that exploded.</p>
<p>If one thinks of this chunk as the total material energy, the mahat-tattva, one can understand that the chunk was agitated by the glance of the Lord, and thus the Lord’s glance is the original cause of material creation.</p>

<p>I can simply utter the word namah, offering all obeisances unto you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The disc of the Lord is called Sudarsana because he does not discriminate between high and low criminals or demons.</p>
<p>Durvasa Muni was certainly a powerful brahmana, but his acts against the pure devotee Maharaja Ambarisa were no better than the activities of asuras.</p>
<p>As stated in the sastras, dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam: (SB 6.3.19) the word dharma refers to the orders or laws given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) real dharma is surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore real dharma means bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Sudarsana cakra is here addressed as dharma-setave, the protector of dharma.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa was a truly religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudarsana cakra was ready to punish even such a strict brahmana as Durvasa Muni because he had acted like a demon.</p>
<p>There are demons even in the form of brahmanas.</p>
<p>Therefore the Sudarsana cakra does not discriminate between brahmana demons and sudra demons.</p>
<p>Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees is called a demon.</p>
<p>In the sastras we find many brahmanas and ksatriyas who acted as demons and have been described as demons.</p>
<p>According to the verdict of the sastras, one has to be understood according to his symptoms.</p>
<p>If one is born of a brahmana father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon.</p>
<p>The Sudarsana cakra is always concerned with annihilating the demons.</p>
<p>Therefore he is described as adharma-silasura-dhuma-ketave.</p>
<p>Those who are not devotees are called adharma-sila.</p>
<p>The Sudarsana cakra is just like an inauspicious comet for all such demons.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O master of speech, by your effulgence, full of religious principles, the darkness of the world is dissipated, and the knowledge of learned persons or great souls is manifested.</p>
<p>Indeed, no one can surpass your effulgence, for all things, manifested and unmanifested, gross and subtle, superior and inferior, are but various forms of you that are manifested by your effulgence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Without illumination, nothing can be seen, especially in this material world.</p>
<p>The illumination in this world emanates from the effulgence of Sudarsana, the original vision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The illuminating principles of the sun, the moon and fire emanate from Sudarsana.</p>
<p>Similarly, illumination by knowledge also comes from Sudarsana because with the illumination of Sudarsana one can distinguish one thing from another, the superior from the inferior.</p>
<p>Generally people accept a powerful yogi like Durvasa Muni as wonderfully superior, but if such a person is chased by the Sudarsana cakra, we can see his real identity and understand how inferior he is because of his dealings with devotees.</p>

<p>Durvasa Muni said: I am very pleased with you, my dear King.</p>
<p>At first I thought of you as an ordinary human being and accepted your hospitality, but later I could understand, by my own intelligence, that you are the most exalted devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, simply by seeing you, touching your feet and talking with you, I have been pleased and have become obliged to you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya: even a very intelligent man cannot understand the activities of a pure Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Therefore, because Durvasa Muni was a great mystic yogi, he first mistook Maharaja Ambarisa for an ordinary human being and wanted to punish him.</p>
<p>Such is the mistaken observation of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>When Durvasa Muni was persecuted by the Sudarsana cakra, however, his intelligence developed.</p>
<p>Therefore the word atma-medhasa is used to indicate that by his personal experience he would understand how great a Vaisnava the King was.</p>
<p>When Durvasa Muni was chased by the Sudarsana cakra, he wanted to take shelter of Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, and he was even able to go to the spiritual world, meet the Personality of Godhead and talk with Him face to face, yet he was unable to be rescued from the attack of the Sudarsana cakra.</p>
<p>Thus he could understand the influence of a Vaisnava by personal experience.</p>
<p>Durvasa Muni was certainly a great yogi and a very learned brahmana, but despite his being a real yogi he was unable to understand the influence of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, vaisnavera kriya mudra vijneha na bujhaya: even the most learned person cannot understand the value of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>There is always a possibility for so-called jnanis and yogis to be mistaken when studying the character of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava can be understood by how much he is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in terms of his inconceivable activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thus being satisfied in all respects, the great mystic yogi Durvasa took permission and left, continuously glorifying the King.</p>
<p>Through the skyways, he went to Brahmaloka, which is devoid of agnostics and dry philosophical speculators.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Durvasa Muni went back to Brahmaloka through the spaceways, he did not need an airplane, for great mystic yogis can transport themselves from any planet to any other without any machine.</p>
<p>There is a planet named Siddhaloka whose inhabitants can go to any other planet because they naturally have all the perfection of yoga practice.</p>
<p>Thus Durvasa Muni, the great mystic yogi, could go through the skyways to any planet, even to Brahmaloka.</p>
<p>In Brahmaloka, everyone is self-realized, and thus there is no need of philosophical speculation to come to the conclusion of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Durvasa Muni’s purpose in going to Brahmaloka was apparently to speak to the residents of Brahmaloka about how powerful a devotee is and how a devotee can surpass every living entity within this material world.</p>
<p>The so-called jnanis and yogis cannot compare to a devotee.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After one year, when Durvasa Muni had returned, King Ambarisa sumptuously fed him all varieties of pure food, and then he himself also ate.</p>
<p>When the King saw that the brahmana Durvasa had been released from the great danger of being burned, he could understand that by the grace of the Lord he himself was also powerful, but he did not take any credit, for everything had been done by the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A devotee like Maharaja Ambarisa is certainly always busy in many activities.</p>
<p>Of course, this material world is full of dangers that one has to meet, but a devotee, because of his full dependence on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is never disturbed.</p>
<p>The vivid example is Maharaja Ambarisa.</p>
<p>He was the emperor of the entire world and had many duties to perform, and in the course of these duties there were many disturbances created by persons like Durvasa Muni, but the King tolerated everything, patiently depending fully on the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord, however, is situated in everyone’s heart (sarvasya caham hrdi sannivistah), and He manages things as He desires.</p>
<p>Thus although Maharaja Ambarisa was faced with many disturbances, the Lord, being merciful to him, managed things so nicely that in the end Durvasa Muni and Maharaja Ambarisa became great friends and parted cordially on the basis of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>After all, Durvasa Muni was convinced of the power of bhakti-yoga, although he himself was a great mystic yogi.</p>
<p>Therefore, as stated by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):</p>
<p>yoginam api sarvesam</p>
<p>mad-gatenantaratmana</p>
<p>sraddhavan bhajate yo mam</p>
<p>sa me yuktatamo matah</p>
<p>Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all Thus it is a fact that a devotee is the topmost yogi, as proved in the dealings of Maharaja Ambarisa with Durvasa Muni.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this way, because of devotional service, Maharaja Ambarisa, who was endowed with varieties of transcendental qualities, was completely aware of Brahman, Paramatma and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and thus he executed devotional service perfectly.</p>
<p>Because of his devotion, he thought even the topmost planet of this material world no better than the hellish planets.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>An exalted and pure devotee like Maharaja Ambarisa is in full awareness of Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan; in other words, a devotee of Vasudeva, Krsna, is in full knowledge of the other features of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>The Absolute Truth is realized in three features—Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan (brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate).</p>
<p>A devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, knows everything (vasudevah sarvam iti (Bg.7.19)) because Vasudeva, Krsna, includes both Paramatma and Brahman.</p>
<p>One does not have to realize Paramatma by the yoga system, for the devotee always thinking of Vasudeva is the topmost yogi (yoginam api sarvesam (Bg.6.47)).</p>
<p>And as far as jnana is concerned, if one is a perfect devotee of Vasudeva, he is the greatest mahatma (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah (Bg.7.19)).</p>
<p>A mahatma is one who has full knowledge of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Thus Maharaja Ambarisa, being a devotee of the personality of Godhead, was in full awareness of Paramatma, Brahman, maya, the material world, the spiritual world, and how things are going on everywhere.</p>
<p>Everything was known to him.</p>
<p>Yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati.</p>
<p>Because the devotee knows Vasudeva, he knows everything within the creation of Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah (Bg.7.19)).</p>
<p>Such a devotee does not give much value to the highest standard of happiness within this material world narayana-parah sarve</p>
<p>na kutascana bibhyati</p>
<p>svargapavarga-narakesv</p>
<p>api tulyartha-darsinah</p>
<p>(Bhag.6.17.28)</p>
<p>Because he is fixed in devotional service, a devotee does not regard any position in the material world as important.</p>
<p>Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati has therefore written (Caitanya-candramrta5):</p>
<p>kaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate</p>
<p>durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate</p>
<p>visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate</p>
<p>yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah</p>
<p>For one who becomes a pure devotee through devotional service to great personalities like Caitanya Mahaprabhu, kaivalya, or merging into Brahman, appears no better than hell.</p>
<p>As far as the heavenly planets are concerned, to a devotee they are like a phantasmagoria or will-o’-the-wisp, and as far as yogic perfection is concerned, a devotee does not care a fig for such perfection, since the purpose of yogic perfection is achieved automatically by the devotee.</p>
<p>This is all possible when one becomes a devotee of the Lord through the medium of Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s instructions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Thereafter, because of his advanced position in devotional life, Maharaja Ambarisa, who no longer desired to live with material things, retired from active family life.</p>
<p>He divided his property among his sons, who were equally as qualified, and he himself took the order of vanaprastha and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully upon Lord Vasudeva.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As a pure devotee, Maharaja Ambarisa was liberated in any condition of life because, as enunciated by Srila Rupa Gosvami, a devotee is always liberated iha yasya harer dasye</p>

<p>Maharaja Ambarisa was undoubtedly liberated in any condition, but as an ideal king he accepted the vanaprastha order of retirement from family life.</p>
<p>It is essential for one to renounce family responsibilities and fully concentrate on the lotus feet of Vasudeva.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who chants this narration or even thinks of this narration about the activities of Maharaja Ambarisa certainly becomes a pure devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura herein gives a very good example.</p>
<p>When one is very eager for more and more money, he is not satisfied even when he is a millionaire or a multimillionaire, but wants to earn more and more money by any means.</p>
<p>The same mentality is present in a devotee.</p>
<p>The devotee is never satisfied, thinking, This is the limit of my devotional service The more he engages in the service of the Lord, the more service he wants to give.</p>
<p>This is the position of a devotee.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa, in his family life, was certainly a pure devotee, complete in every respect, because his mind and all his senses were engaged in devotional service (sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane).</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa was self-satisfied because all of his senses were engaged in devotional service (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam/ hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate (Cc.Madhya 19.170)).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, although Maharaja Ambarisa had engaged all his senses in devotional service, he left his home and went to the forest to concentrate his mind fully at the lotus feet of Krsna, exactly as a mercantile man, even though complete in wealth, tries to earn more and more.</p>
<p>This mentality of getting more and more engaged in devotional service puts one in the most exalted position.</p>
<p>Whereas on the karma platform the mercantile man who wants more and more money becomes increasingly bound and entangled, the devotee becomes increasingly liberated.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-4" id="summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#96" id="96">9.6</a></h3>
<p>After describing the descendants of Maharaja Ambarisa, Sukadeva Gosvami described all the kings from Sasada to Mandhata, and in this connection he also described how the great sage Saubhari married the daughters of Mandhata.</p>
<p>Maharaja Ambarisa had three sons, named Virupa, Ketuman and Sambhu.</p>
<p>The son of Virupa was Prsadasva, and his son was Rathitara.</p>
<p>Rathitara had no sons, but when he requested the favor of the great sage Angira, the sage begot several sons in the womb of Rathitara’s wife.</p>
<p>When the sons were born, they became the dynasty of Angira Rsi and of Rathitara.</p>
<p>The son of Manu was Iksvaku, who had one hundred sons, of whom Vikuksi, Nimi and Dandaka were the eldest.</p>
<p>The sons of Maharaja Iksvaku became kings of different parts of the world.</p>
<p>Because of violating sacrificial rules and regulations, one of these sons, Vikuksi, was banished from the kingdom.</p>
<p>By the mercy of Vasistha and the power of mystic yoga, Maharaja Iksvaku attained liberation after giving up his material body.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Iksvaku expired, his son Vikuksi returned and took charge of the kingdom.</p>
<p>He performed various types of sacrifices, and thus he pleased the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This Vikuksi later became celebrated as Sasada.</p>
<p>Vikuksi’s son fought with the demons for the sake of the demigods, and because of his valuable service he became famous as Puranjaya, Indravaha and Kakutstha.</p>
<p>The son of Puranjaya was Anena, the son of Anena was Prthu, and the son of Prthu was Visvagandhi.</p>
<p>The son of Visvagandhi was Candra, the son of Candra was Yuvanasva, and his son was Sravasta, who constructed Sravasti Puri.</p>
<p>The son of Sravasta was Brhadasva.</p>
<p>Brhadasva’s son Kuvalayasva killed a demon named Dhundhu, and thus he became celebrated as Dhundhumara, the killer of Dhundhu The sons of the killer of Dhundhu were Drdhasva, Kapilasva and Bhadrasva.</p>
<p>He also had thousands of other sons, but they burned to ashes in the fire emanating from Dhundhu.</p>
<p>The son of Drdhasva was Haryasva, the son of Haryasva was Nikumbha, the son of Nikumbha was Bahulasva, and the son of Bahulasva was Krsasva.</p>
<p>The son of Krsasva was Senajit, and his son was Yuvanasva.</p>
<p>Yuvanasva married one hundred wives, but he had no sons, and therefore he entered the forest.</p>
<p>In the forest, the sages performed a sacrifice known as Indra-yajna on his behalf.</p>
<p>Once, however, the King became so thirsty in the forest that he drank the water kept for performing yajna.</p>
<p>Consequently, after some time, a son came forth from the right side of his abdomen.</p>
<p>The son, who was very beautiful, was crying to drink breast milk, and Indra gave the child his index finger to suck.</p>
<p>Thus the son became known as Mandhata.</p>
<p>In due course of time, Yuvanasva achieved perfection by performing austerities.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Mandhata became the emperor and ruled the earth, which consists of seven islands.</p>
<p>Thieves and rogues were very much afraid of this powerful king, and therefore the king was known as Trasaddasyu, meaning one who is very fearful to rogues and thieves Mandhata begot sons in the womb of his wife, Bindumati.</p>
<p>These sons were Purukutsa, Ambarisa and Mucukunda.</p>
<p>These three sons had fifty sisters, all of whom became wives of the great sage known as Saubhari.</p>
<p>In this connection, Sukadeva Gosvami described the history of Saubhari Muni, who, because of sensual agitation caused by fish, fell from his yoga and wanted to marry all the daughters of Mandhata for sexual pleasure.</p>
<p>Later, Saubhari Muni became very regretful.</p>
<p>Thus he accepted the order of vanaprastha, performed very severe austerities, and thus attained perfection.</p>
<p>In this regard, Sukadeva Gosvami described how Saubhari Muni’s wives also became perfect.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Rathitara had no sons, and therefore he requested the great sage Angira to beget sons for him.</p>
<p>Because of this request, Angira begot sons in the womb of Rathitara’s wife.</p>
<p>All these sons were born with brahminical prowess.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Vedic age a man was sometimes called upon to beget sons in the womb of a lesser man’s wife for the sake of better progeny.</p>
<p>In such an instance, the woman is compared to an agricultural field.</p>
<p>A person possessing an agricultural field may employ another person to produce food grains from it, but because the grains are produced from the land, they are considered the property of the owner of the land.</p>
<p>Similarly, a woman was sometimes allowed to be impregnated by someone other than her husband, but the sons born of her would then become her husband’s sons.</p>
<p>Such sons were called ksetra jata.</p>
<p>Because Rathitara had no sons, he took advantage of this method.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Having been born from the womb of Rathitara’s wife, all these sons were known as the dynasty of Rathitara, but because they were born from the semen of Angira, they were also known as the dynasty of Angira.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, Iksvaku’s son Vikuksi went to the forest and killed many animals suitable for being offered as oblations.</p>
<p>But when fatigued and hungry he became forgetful and ate a rabbit he had killed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is evident that ksatriyas killed animals in the forest because the flesh of the animals was suitable to be offered at a particular type of yajna.</p>
<p>Offering oblations to the forefathers in the ceremony known as sraddha is also a kind of yajna.</p>
<p>In this yajna, flesh obtained from the forest by hunting could be offered.</p>
<p>However, in the present age, Kali-yuga, this kind of offering is forbidden.</p>
<p>Quoting from the Brahma-vaivarta Purana, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said:</p>
<p>asvamedham gavalambham</p>
<p>sannyasam pala-paitrkam</p>
<p>devarena sutotpattim</p>
<p>kalau panca vivarjayet</p>
<p>(Cc.Adi 17.164)</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of sannyasa, the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife The word pala-paitrkam refers to an offering of flesh in oblations to forefathers.</p>
<p>Formerly, such an offering was allowed, but in this age it is forbidden.</p>
<p>In this age, Kali-yuga, everyone is expert in hunting animals, but most of the people are sudras, not ksatriyas.</p>
<p>According to Vedic injunctions, however, only ksatriyas are allowed to hunt, whereas sudras are allowed to eat flesh after offering goats or other insignificant animals before the deity of goddess Kali or similar demigods.</p>
<p>On the whole, meat-eating is not completely forbidden; a particular class of men is allowed to eat meat according to various circumstances and injunctions.</p>
<p>As far as eating beef is concerned, however, it is strictly prohibited to everyone.</p>
<p>Thus in Bhagavad-gita Krsna personally speaks of go-raksyam, cow protection.</p>
<p>Meat-eaters, according to their different positions and the directions of the sastra, are allowed to eat flesh, but never the flesh of cows.</p>
<p>Cows must be given all protection.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Vikuksi offered the remnants of the flesh to King Iksvaku, who gave it to Vasistha for purification.</p>
<p>But Vasistha could immediately understand that part of the flesh had already been taken by Vikuksi, and therefore he said that it was unfit to be used in the sraddha ceremony.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>That which is meant to be offered in yajna cannot be tasted by anyone before being offered to the Deity.</p>
<p>In our temples, this regulation is in effect.</p>
<p>One cannot eat food from the kitchen unless it is offered to the Deity.</p>
<p>If something is taken before being offered to the Deity, the entire preparation is polluted and can no longer be offered.</p>
<p>Those engaged in Deity worship must know this very well so that they may be saved from committing offenses in Deity worship.</p>

<p>Because Saubhari Muni was expert in chanting mantras perfectly, his severe austerities resulted in an opulent home, with garments, ornaments, properly dressed and decorated maidservants and manservants, and varieties of parks with clear-water lakes and gardens.</p>
<p>In the gardens, fragrant with varieties of flowers, birds chirped and bees hummed, surrounded by professional singers.</p>
<p>Saubhari Muni’s home was amply provided with valuable beds, seats, ornaments, and arrangements for bathing, and there were varieties of sandalwood creams, flower garlands, and palatable dishes.</p>
<p>Thus surrounded by opulent paraphernalia, the muni engaged in family affairs with his numerous wives.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Saubhari Rsi was a great yogi.</p>
<p>Yogic perfection makes available eight material opulences—anima, laghima, mahima, prapti, prakamya, isitva, vasitva and kamavasayita.</p>
<p>Saubhari Muni exhibited super-excellence in material enjoyment by dint of his yogic perfection.</p>
<p>The word bahv-rca means expert in chanting mantras As material opulence can be achieved by ordinary material means, it can also be achieved by subtle means through mantras.</p>
<p>By chanting mantras, Saubhari Muni arranged for material opulence, but this was not perfection in life.</p>
<p>As will be seen, Saubhari Muni became very dissatisfied with material opulence and thus left everything and reentered the forest in the vanaprastha order and achieved final success.</p>
<p>Those who are not atma-tattva-vit, who do not know the spiritual value of life, can be satisfied with external material opulences, but those who are atma-tattva-vit are not inspired by material opulence.</p>

<p>In this way, Saubhari Muni enjoyed sense gratification in the material world, but he was not at all satisfied, just as a fire never ceases blazing if constantly supplied with drops of fat.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material desire is just like a blazing fire.</p>
<p>If a fire is continually supplied with drops of fat, the fire will increase more and more and never be extinguished.</p>
<p>Therefore the policy of trying to satisfy material desires by catering to one’s material demands will never be successful.</p>
<p>In modern civilization, everyone is engaged in economic development, which is another way of constantly dropping fat into the material fire.</p>
<p>The Western countries have reached the summit of material civilization, but people are still dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Real satisfaction is Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (5.29), where Krsna says:</p>
<p>bhoktaram yajna-tapasam</p>
<p>sarva-loka-mahesvaram</p>
<p>suhrdam sarva-bhutanam</p>

<p>The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries One must therefore take to Krsna consciousness and advance in Krsna consciousness by properly following the regulative principles.</p>

<p>Thereafter, one day while Saubhari Muni, who was expert in chanting mantras, was sitting in a secluded place, he thought to himself about the cause of his falldown, which was simply that he had associated himself with the sexual affairs of the fish.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Saubhari Muni had fallen from his austerity because of a vaisnava-aparadha.</p>
<p>The history is that when Garuda wanted to eat fish, Saubhari Muni unnecessarily gave the fish shelter under his care.</p>
<p>Because Garuda’s plans for eating were disappointed, Saubhari Muni certainly committed a great offense to a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Because of this vaisnava-aparadha, an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava, Saubhari Muni fell from his exalted position of mystic tapasya.</p>
<p>One should not, therefore, impede the activities of a Vaisnava.</p>

<p>A person desiring liberation from material bondage must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and should not employ his senses externally (in seeing, hearing, talking, walking and so on).</p>
<p>One should always stay in a secluded place, completely fixing his mind at the lotus feet of the unlimited Personality of Godhead, and if one wants any association at all, he should associate with persons similarly engaged.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Saubhari Muni, giving conclusions derived from his practical experience, instructs us that persons interested in crossing to the other side of the material ocean must give up the association of persons interested in sex life and accumulating money.</p>
<p>This is also advised by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu:</p>

<p>Alas, for a person seriously desiring to cross the material ocean and engage in the transcendental loving service of the Lord without material motives, seeing a materialist engaged in sense gratification and seeing a woman who is similarly interested is more abominable than drinking poison willingly One who desires complete freedom from material bondage can engage himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>He must not associate with visayi—materialistic persons or those interested in sex life.</p>
<p>Every materialist is interested in sex.</p>
<p>Thus in plain language it is advised that an exalted saintly person avoid the association of those who are materially inclined.</p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura also recommends that one engage in the service of the acaryas, and if one wants to live in association, he must live in the association of devotees (tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa).</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is creating many centers just to create devotees so that by associating with the members of such a center people will automatically become uninterested in material affairs.</p>
<p>Although this is an ambitious proposal, this association is proving effective by the mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>By gradually associating with the members of the Krsna consciousness movement, simply by taking prasada and taking part in chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, ordinary persons are being considerably elevated.</p>
<p>Saubhari Muni regrets that he had bad association even in the deepest part of the water.</p>
<p>Because of the bad association of the sexually engaged fish, he fell down.</p>
<p>A secluded place is also not secure unless there is good association.</p>

<p>In the beginning I was alone and engaged in performing the austerities of mystic yoga, but later, because of the association of fish engaged in sex, I desired to marry.</p>
<p>Then I became the husband of fifty wives, and in each of them I begot one hundred sons, and thus my family increased to five thousand members.</p>
<p>By the influence of the modes of material nature, I became fallen and thought that I would be happy in material life.</p>
<p>Thus there is no end to my material desires for enjoyment, in this life and the next.</p>

<p>At the time of death, fire burns the gross body, and if there is no more desire for material enjoyment the subtle body is also ended, and in this way a pure soul remains.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>

<p>They were unfit, but because they were faithful followers of their husband, they also entered the spiritual world with him.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-5" id="summary-5">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#97" id="97">9.7</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter the descendants of King Mandhata are described, and in this connection the histories of Purukutsa and Hariscandra are also given.</p>
<p>The most prominent son of Mandhata was Ambarisa, his son was Yauvanasva, and Yauvanasva’s son was Harita.</p>
<p>These three personalities were the best in the dynasty of Mandhata.</p>
<p>Purukutsa, another son of Mandhata, married the sister of the snakes (sarpa-gana) named Narmada.</p>
<p>The son of Purukutsa was Trasaddasyu, whose son was Anaranya.</p>
<p>Anaranya’s son was Haryasva, Haryasva’s son was Praruna, Praruna’s son was Tribandhana, and Tribandhana’s son was Satyavrata, also known as Trisanku.</p>
<p>When Trisanku kidnapped the daughter of a brahmana, his father cursed him for this sinful act, and Trisanku became a candala, worse than a sudra.</p>
<p>Later, by the influence of Visvamitra, he was brought to the heavenly planets, but by the influence of the demigods he fell back downward.</p>
<p>He was stopped in his fall, however, by the influence of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra.</p>
<p>Hariscandra once performed a Rajasuya-yajna, but Visvamitra cunningly took all of Hariscandra’s possessions as a daksina contribution and chastised Hariscandra in various ways.</p>
<p>Because of this, a quarrel arose between Visvamitra and Vasistha.</p>
<p>Hariscandra had no sons, but on the advice of Narada he worshiped Varuna and in this way got a son named Rohita.</p>
<p>Hariscandra promised that Rohita would be used to perform a Varuna-yajna.</p>
<p>Varuna reminded Hariscandra repeatedly about this yajna, but the King, because of affection for his son, gave various arguments to avoid sacrificing him.</p>
<p>Thus time passed, and gradually the son grew up.</p>
<p>To safeguard his life, the boy then took bow and arrows in hand and went to the forest.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at home, Hariscandra suffered from dropsy because of an attack from Varuna.</p>
<p>When Rohita received the news that his father was suffering, he wanted to return to the capital, but King Indra prevented him from doing so.</p>
<p>Following the instructions of Indra, Rohita lived in the forest for six years and then returned home.</p>
<p>Rohita purchased Sunahsepha, the second son of Ajigarta, and gave him to his father, Hariscandra, as the sacrificial animal.</p>
<p>In this way, the sacrifice was performed, Varuna and the other demigods were pacified, and Hariscandra was freed from disease.</p>
<p>In this sacrifice, Visvamitra was the hota priest, Jamadagni was the adhvaryu, Vasistha was the brahma, and Ayasya was the udgata.</p>
<p>King Indra, being very satisfied by the sacrifice, gave Hariscandra a golden chariot, and Visvamitra gave him transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus Sukadeva Gosvami describes how Hariscandra achieved perfection.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The son of Trisanku was Hariscandra.</p>
<p>Because of Hariscandra there was a quarrel between Visvamitra and Vasistha, who for many years fought one another, having been transformed into birds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Visvamitra and Vasistha were always inimical.</p>
<p>Formerly, Visvamitra was a ksatriya, and by undergoing severe austerities he wanted to become a brahmana, but Vasistha would not agree to accept him.</p>
<p>In this way there was always disagreement between the two.</p>
<p>Later, however, Vasistha accepted him because of Visvamitra’s quality of forgiveness.</p>
<p>Once Hariscandra performed a yajna for which Visvamitra was the priest, but Visvamitra, being angry at Hariscandra, took away all his possessions, claiming them as a contribution of daksina.</p>
<p>Vasistha, however, did not like this, and therefore a fight arose between Vasistha and Visvamitra.</p>
<p>The fighting became so severe that each of them cursed the other.</p>
<p>One of them said, May you become a bird and the other said, May you become a duck Thus both of them became birds and continued fighting for many years because of Hariscandra.</p>
<p>We can see that such a great mystic yogi as Saubhari became a victim of sense gratification, and such great sages as Vasistha and Visvamitra became birds.</p>
<p>This is the material world.</p>
<p>Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino ’rjuna (Bg.8.16).</p>
<p>Within this material world, or within this universe, however elevated one may be in material qualities, one must suffer the conditions of birth, death, old age and disease (janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi).</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says that this material world is simply miserable (duhkhalayam asasvatam (Bg.8.15)).</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam says, padam padam yad vipadam: at every step here there is danger.</p>
<p>Therefore, because the Krsna consciousness movement provides the opportunity for the human being to get out of this material world simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, this movement is the greatest benediction in human society.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#98" id="98">9.8</a></h3>
<p>In this Eighth Chapter the descendants of Rohita are described.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Rohita there was a king named Sagara, whose history is described in relation to Kapiladeva and the destruction of the sons of Sagara.</p>
<p>The son of Rohita was known as Harita, and the son of Harita was Campa, who constructed a township known as Campapuri.</p>
<p>The son of Campa was Sudeva, the son of Sudeva was Vijaya, the son of Vijaya was Bharuka, and the son of Bharuka was Vrka.</p>
<p>Bahuka, the son of Vrka, was greatly disturbed by his enemies, and therefore he left home with his wife and went to the forest.</p>
<p>When he died there, his wife wanted to accept the principles of sati, dying with her husband, but when she was about to die a sage named Aurva found that she was pregnant and forbade her to do so.</p>
<p>The co-wives of this wife of Bahuka gave her poison with her food, but still her son was born with the poison.</p>
<p>The son was therefore named Sagara (sa means with and gara means poiso).</p>
<p>Following the instructions of the great sage Aurva, King Sagara reformed many clans, including the Yavanas, Sakas, Haihayas and Barbaras.</p>
<p>The king did not kill them, but reformed them.</p>
<p>Then, again following the instructions of Aurva, King Sagara performed asvamedha sacrifices, but the horse needed for such a sacrifice was stolen by Indra, the King of heaven.</p>
<p>King Sagara had two wives, named Sumati and Kesini.</p>
<p>While searching for the horse, the sons of Sumati extensively dug up the surface of the earth and in this way dug a trench, which later became known as the Sagara Ocean.</p>
<p>In the course of this search, they came upon the great personality Kapiladeva and thought Him to have stolen the horse.</p>
<p>With this offensive understanding, they attacked Him and were all burned to ashes.</p>
<p>Kesini, the second wife of King Sagara, had a son named Asamanjasa, whose son Amsuman later searched for the horse and delivered his uncles.</p>
<p>Upon approaching Kapiladeva, Amsuman saw both the horse meant for sacrifice and a pile of ashes.</p>
<p>Amsuman offered prayers to Kapiladeva, who was very pleased by his prayers and who returned the horse.</p>
<p>After getting back the horse, however, Amsuman still stood before Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva could understand that Amsuman was praying for the deliverance of his forefathers.</p>
<p>Thus Kapiladeva offered the instruction that they could be delivered by water from the Ganges.</p>
<p>Amsuman then offered respectful obeisances to Kapiladeva, circumambulated Him, and left that place with the horse for sacrifice.</p>
<p>When King Sagara finished his yajna, he handed over the kingdom to Amsuman and, following the advice of Aurva, attained salvation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kapila Muni enunciated in this material world the Sankhya philosophy, which is a strong boat with which to cross over the ocean of nescience.</p>
<p>Indeed, a person eager to cross the ocean of the material world may take shelter of this philosophy.</p>
<p>In such a greatly learned person, situated on the elevated platform of transcendence, how can there be any distinction between enemy and friend?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who is promoted to the transcendental position (brahma-bhuta) is always jubilant (prasannatma).</p>
<p>He is unaffected by the false distinctions between good and bad in the material world.</p>
<p>Therefore, such an exalted person is samah sarvesu bhutesu; that is to say, he is equal toward everyone, not distinguishing between friend and enemy.</p>
<p>Because he is on the absolute platform, free from material contamination, he is called paratma-bhuta or brahma-bhuta.</p>
<p>Kapila Muni, therefore, was not at all angry at the sons of Sagara Maharaja; rather, they were burnt to ashes by the heat of their own bodies.</p>

<p>Formerly, in his previous birth, Asamanjasa had been a great mystic yogi, but by bad association he had fallen from his exalted position.</p>
<p>Now, in this life, he was born in a royal family and was a jati-smara; that is, he had the special advantage of being able to remember his past birth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he wanted to display himself as a miscreant, and therefore he would do things that were abominable in the eyes of the public and unfavorable to his relatives.</p>
<p>He would disturb the boys sporting in the River Sarayu by throwing them into the depths of the water.</p>

<p>Asamanjasa was a jati-smara; because of his mystic power, he did not forget his previous consciousness.</p>

<p>Similarly, the demigods are generally in the mode of passion, and living entities lower than the demigods, such as human beings and animals, are in the mode of ignorance, or in mixed goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore Amsuman wanted to explain that because his uncles, who had burnt to ashes, were under the modes of material nature, they could not understand Lord Kapiladeva Because You are beyond even the direct and indirect intelligence of Lord Brahma he prayed, unless we are enlightened by Your Lordship it will not be possible for us to understand You</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You are fully situated in everyone’s heart, but the living entities, covered by the material body, cannot see You, for they are influenced by the external energy, conducted by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Their intelligence being covered by sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna, they can see only the actions and reactions of these three modes of material nature.</p>

<p>Unless one is situated in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, one is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-7" id="summary-7">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#99" id="99">9.9</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the history of the dynasty of Amsuman, up to Khatvanga, and it also describes how Bhagiratha brought the water of the Ganges to this earth.</p>
<p>The son of Maharaja Amsuman was Dilipa, who tried to bring the Ganges to this world but who died without success.Bhagaratha, the son of Dilipa, was determined to bring the Ganges to the material world, and for this purpose he underwent severe austerities.</p>
<p>Mother Ganges, being fully satisfied by his austerities, made herself visible to him, wanting to give him a benediction.Bhagaratha then asked her to deliver his forefathers.</p>
<p>Although mother Ganges agreed to come down to earth, she made two conditions: first, she wanted some suitable male to be able to control her waves; second, although all sinful men would be freed from sinful reactions by bathing in the Ganges, mother Ganges did not want to keep all these sinful reactions.</p>
<p>These two conditions were subject matters for consideration.Bhagaratha replied to mother Ganges, The Personality of Godhead Lord Siva will be completely able to control the waves of your water, and when pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions left by sinful men will be counteracted Bhagiratha then performed austerities to satisfy Lord Siva, who is called Asutosa because he is naturally satisfied very easily.</p>
<p>Lord Siva agreed to Bhagiratha’s proposal to check the force of the Ganges.</p>
<p>In this way, simply by the touch of the Ganges, Bhagiratha’s forefathers were delivered and allowed to go to the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>The son of Bhagiratha was Sruta, the son of Sruta was Nabha, and Nabha’s son was Sindhudvipa.</p>
<p>The son of Sindhudvipa was Ayutayu, and the son of Ayutayu was Rtuparna, who was a friend of Nala.</p>
<p>Rtuparna gave Nala the art of gambling and learned from him the art of asva-vidya.</p>
<p>The son of Rtuparna was known as Sarvakama, the son of Sarvakama was Sudasa, and his son was Saudasa.</p>
<p>The wife of Saudasa was named Damayanti or Madayanti, and Saudasa was also known as Kalmasapada.</p>
<p>Because of some defect in his fruitive activities, Saudasa was cursed by Vasistha to become a Raksasa.</p>
<p>While walking through the forest, he saw a brahmana engaged in sex with his wife, and because he had become a Raksasa he wanted to devour the brahmana.</p>
<p>Although the brahmana’s wife pleaded with him in many ways, Saudasa devoured the brahmana, and the wife therefore cursed him, saying, As soon as you engage in sex you will die After twelve years, therefore, even though Saudasa was released from the curse of Vasistha Muni, he remained sonless.</p>
<p>At that time, with Saudasa’s permission, Vasistha impregnated Saudasa’s wife, Madayanti.</p>
<p>Because Madayanti bore the child for many years but still could not give birth, Vasistha struck her abdomen with a stone, and thus a son was born.</p>
<p>The son was named Asmaka.</p>
<p>The son of Asmaka was known as Balika.</p>
<p>He was protected from the curse of Parasurama because of being surrounded by many women, and therefore he is also known as Narikavaca.</p>
<p>When the entire world was devoid of ksatriyas, he became the original father of more ksatriyas.</p>
<p>He is therefore sometimes called Mulaka.</p>
<p>From Balika, Dasaratha was born, from Dasaratha came Aidavidi, and from Aidavidi came Visvasaha.</p>
<p>The son of Visvasaha was Maharaja Khatvanga.</p>
<p>Maharaja Khatvanga joined the demigods in fighting the demons and was victorious, and the demigods therefore wanted to give him a benediction.</p>
<p>But when the King inquired how long he would live and understood that his life would last only a few seconds more, he immediately left the heavenly planets and returned to his own abode by airplane.</p>
<p>He could understand that everything in this material world is insignificant, and thus he fully engaged in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead says:</p>

<p>Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.</p>
<p>I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>Do not fear (Bg.18.66) The Supreme Personality of Godhead can accept the reactions of anyone’s sinful deeds and neutralize them because He is pavitra, pure, like the sun, which is never contaminated by any worldly infection.</p>
<p>Tejiyasam na dosaya vahneh sama-bhujo yatha (Bhag.10.33.29).</p>
<p>One who is very powerful is not affected by any sinful activity.</p>
<p>But here we see that mother Ganges fears being burdened with the sins of the people in general who would bathe in her waters.</p>
<p>This indicates that no one but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is able to neutralize the reactions of sinful deeds, whether one’s own or those of others.</p>
<p>Sometimes the spiritual master, after accepting a disciple, must take charge of that disciple’s past sinful activities and, being overloaded, must sometimes suffer—if not fully, then partially—for the sinful acts of the disciple.</p>
<p>Every disciple, therefore, must be very careful not to commit sinful activities after initiation.</p>
<p>The poor spiritual master is kind and merciful enough to accept a disciple and partially suffer for that disciple’s sinful activities, but Krsna, being merciful to His servant, neutralizes the reactions of sinful deeds for the servant who engages in preaching His glories.</p>
<p>Even mother Ganges feared the sinful reactions of the people in general and was anxious about how she would counteract the burden of these sins.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Bhagaratha said: Those who are saintly because of devotional service and are therefore in the renounced order, free from material desires, and who are pure devotees, expert in following the regulative principles mentioned in the Vedas, are always glorious and pure in behavior and are able to deliver all fallen souls.</p>
<p>When such pure devotees bathe in your water, the sinful reactions accumulated from other people will certainly be counteracted, for such devotees always keep in the core of their hearts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can vanquish all sinful reactions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Mother Ganges is available to everyone for bathing.</p>
<p>Therefore, not only will sinful persons bathe in the Ganges water, but in Hardwar and other holy places where the Ganges flows, saintly persons and devotees will also bathe in the waters of the Ganges.</p>
<p>Devotees and saintly persons advanced in the renounced order can deliver even the Ganges.</p>
<p>Tirthi-kurvanti tirthani svantah-sthena gadabhrta (Bhag.1.13.10).</p>
<p>Because saintly devotees always keep the Lord within the core of their hearts, they can perfectly cleanse the holy places of all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Therefore, people in general must always respectfully honor saintly persons.</p>
<p>It is ordered that as soon as one sees a Vaisnava, or even a sannyasi, one should immediately offer respects to such a holy man.</p>
<p>If one forgets to show respect in this way, one must observe a fast for that day.</p>
<p>This is a Vedic injunction.</p>
<p>One must be extremely careful to refrain from committing offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee or saintly person.</p>
<p>There are methods of prayascitta, or atonement, but they are inadequate to cleanse one of sinful reactions.</p>
<p>One can be cleansed of sinful reactions only by devotional service, as stated in regard to the history of Ajamila:</p>
<p>kecit kevalaya bhaktya</p>
<p>vasudeva-parayanah</p>
<p>agham dhunvanti kartsnyena</p>
<p>niharam iva bhaskarah</p>
<p>Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Krsna can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive.</p>
<p>He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays (Bhag.6.1.15) If one is under the protection of a devotee and sincerely renders service unto him, by this process of bhakti-yoga one is certainly able to counteract all sinful reactions.</p>

<p>Like a cloth woven of threads extending for its length and breadth, this entire universe, in all its latitude and longitude, is situated under different potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is the incarnation of the Lord, and thus he represents the Supersoul in the embodied soul.</p>
<p>He can sustain your forceful waves on his head.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The water of the Ganges is supposed to rest on the head of Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sustains the entire universe by different potencies.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.45):</p>
<p>ksiram yatha dadhi vikara-visesa-yogat</p>
<p>sanjayate na hi tatah prthag asti hetoh</p>
<p>yah sambhutam api tatha samupaiti karyad</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>Milk changes into yogurt when mixed with a yogurt culture, but actually yogurt is constitutionally nothing but milk.</p>
<p>Similarly, Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, assumes the form of Lord Siva for the special purpose of material transactions.</p>
<p>I offer my obeisances at Lord Govinda’s lotus feet Lord Siva is the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the same sense that yogurt is also milk although at the same time it is not milk.</p>
<p>For the maintenance of the material world there are three incarnations—Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara (Lord Siva).</p>
<p>Lord Siva is Visnu in an incarnation for the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>The material world exists predominantly in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Siva is compared here to the longitude and latitude of the entire universe, which resembles a cloth woven of threads extending for both its length and breadth.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The words asv atusyata indicate that Lord Siva was satisfied very soon.</p>
<p>Therefore another name for Lord Siva is Asutosa.</p>
<p>Materialistic persons become attached to Lord Siva because Lord Siva bestows benedictions upon anyone and everyone very quickly, not caring to know how his devotees prosper or suffer.</p>
<p>Although materialistic persons know that material happiness is nothing but another side of suffering, they want it, and to get it very quickly they worship Lord Siva.</p>
<p>We find that materialists are generally devotees of many demigods, especially Lord Siva and mother Durga.</p>
<p>They do not actually want spiritual happiness, for it is almost unknown to them.</p>
<p>But if one is serious about being happy spiritually, he must take shelter of Lord Visnu, as the Lord personally demands:</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because the sons of Sagara Maharaja had offended a great personality, the heat of their bodies had increased, and they were burnt to ashes.</p>
<p>But simply by being sprinkled with water from the Ganges, all of them became eligible to go to the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of those who use the water of mother Ganges to worship her?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Mother Ganges is worshiped by the water of the Ganges: a devotee takes a little water from the Ganges and offers it back to the Ganges.</p>
<p>When the devotee takes the water, mother Ganges does not lose anything, and when the water is offered back, mother Ganges does not increase, but in this way the worshiper of the Ganges is benefited.</p>
<p>Similarly, a devotee of the Lord offers the Lord patram puspam phalam toyam—a leaf, flower, fruit or water—in great devotion, but everything, including the leaf, flower, fruit and water, belongs to the Lord, and therefore there is nothing to renounce or to accept.</p>

<p>Simply by having water from the Ganges come in contact with the ashes of their burnt bodies, the sons of Sagara Maharaja were elevated to the heavenly planets.</p>

<p>O King, O hero, this human body is meant for universal benefits.</p>
<p>If you kill this body untimely, you will kill all the benefits of human life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:</p>
<p>hari hari viphale janama gonainu</p>
<p>janiya suniya visa khainu</p>
<p>The body of a human being is extremely valuable because in this body one can understand the instructions of Krsna and attain the ultimate destination of the living entity.</p>
<p>The living entity is within the material world to fulfill the mission of going back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>In the material world, one hankers for happiness, but because one does not know the ultimate destination, one changes bodies one after another.</p>
<p>However, if one gets the opportunity to possess a human form of body, in this body he can fulfill the four principles of dharma, artha, kama and moksa, and if one is properly regulated he makes further progress, after liberation, to engage in the service of Radha and Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the success of life: to stop the process of repeated birth and death and go back home, back to Godhead (mam eti), to be engaged in the service of Radha and Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, taking a human body is meant for completing one’s progress in life.</p>
<p>Throughout human society, killing of a human being is taken very seriously.</p>
<p>Hundreds and thousands of animals are killed in slaughterhouses, and no one cares about them, but the killing of even one human being is taken very seriously.</p>
<p>Why? Because the human form of body is extremely important in executing the mission of life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Here is a learned, highly qualified brahmana, engaged in performing austerity and eagerly desiring to worship the Supreme Lord, the Supersoul who lives within the core of the heart in all living entities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The wife of the brahmana did not regard her husband as a superficial brahmana who was called a brahmana merely because he was born of a brahmana family.</p>
<p>Rather, this brahmana was actually qualified with the brahminical symptoms.</p>
<p>Yasya yal laksanam proktam (Bhag.7.11.35).</p>
<p>The symptoms of a brahmana are stated in the sastra:</p>
<p>samo damas tapah saucam</p>
<p>ksantir arjavam eva ca</p>
<p>jnanam vijnanam astikyam</p>
<p>brahma-karma svabhavajam</p>
<p>Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work (Bg.18.42) Not only must a brahmana be qualified, but he must also engage in actual brahminical activities.</p>
<p>Simply to be qualified is not enough; one must engage in a brahmana’s duties.</p>
<p>The duty of a brahmana is to know the param brahma, Krsna (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12)).</p>
<p>Because this brahmana was actually qualified and was also engaged in brahminical activities (brahma-karma), killing him would be a greatly sinful act, and the brahmana’s wife requested that he not be killed.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#9930" id="9930">9.9.30</a></h3>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My lord, you are completely aware of the religious principles.</p>
<p>As a son never deserves to be killed by his father, here is a brahmana who should be protected by the king, and never killed.</p>
<p>How does he deserve to be killed by a rajarsi like you?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word rajarsi refers to a king who behaves like a rsi, or sage.</p>
<p>Such a king is also called naradeva because he is considered a representative of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Because his duty is to rule the kingdom to maintain brahminical culture, he never desires to kill a brahmana.</p>
<p>Generally, a brahmana, woman, child, old man or cow is never regarded as punishable.</p>
<p>Thus the wife of the brahmana requested the King to refrain from this sinful act.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>You are well known and worshiped in learned circles.</p>
<p>How dare you kill this brahmana, who is a saintly, sinless person, well versed in Vedic knowledge? Killing him would be like destroying the embryo within the womb or killing a cow.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Amara-kosa dictionary, bhruno’rbhake bala-garbhe: the word bhruna refers either to the cow or to the living entity in embryo.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, destroying the undeveloped embryo of the soul in the womb is as sinful as killing a cow or a brahmana.</p>
<p>In the embryo, the living entity is present in an undeveloped stage.</p>
<p>The modern scientific theory that life is a combination of chemicals is nonsense; scientists cannot manufacture living beings, even like those born from eggs.</p>
<p>The idea that scientists can develop a chemical situation resembling that of an egg and bring life from it is nonsensical.</p>
<p>Their theory that a chemical combination can have life may be accepted, but these rascals cannot create such a combination.</p>
<p>This verse refers to bhrunasya vadham—the killing of a bhruna or destruction of the embryo.</p>
<p>Here is a challenge from the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>The crude, atheistic understanding that the living entity is a combination of matter belongs to the grossest ignorance.</p>

<p>Without my husband, I cannot live for a moment.</p>
<p>If you want to eat my husband, it would be better to eat me first, for without my husband I am as good as a dead body.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Vedic culture there is a system known as sati or saha-marana, in which a woman dies with her husband.</p>
<p>According to this system, if the husband dies, the wife will voluntarily die by falling in the blazing funeral pyre of her husband.</p>
<p>Here, in this verse, the feelings inherent in this culture are expressed by the wife of the brahmana.</p>
<p>A woman without a husband is like a dead body.</p>
<p>Therefore according to Vedic culture a girl must be married.</p>
<p>This is the responsibility of her father.</p>
<p>A girl may be given in charity, and a husband may have more than one wife, but a girl must be married.</p>
<p>This is Vedic culture.</p>
<p>A woman is supposed to be always dependent—in her childhood she is dependent on her father, in youth on her husband, and in old age on her elderly sons.</p>
<p>According to Manu-samhita, she is never independent.</p>
<p>Independence for a woman means miserable life.</p>
<p>In this age, so many girls are unmarried and falsely imagining themselves free, but their life is miserable.</p>
<p>Here is an instance in which a woman felt that without her husband she was nothing but a dead body.</p>

<p>Even though the brahmana’s wife spoke so pitiably, Saudasa was unmoved by her lamentation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is an example of destiny.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>asmakat—from that son named Asmaka; balikah—a son named Balika; jajne—was born; yah—this child Balika; stribhih—by women; pariraksitah—was protected; nari-kavacah—having a shield of women; iti uktah—was known as such; nihksatre—when there were no ksatriyas (all ksatriyas having been vanquished by Parasurama); mulakah—Mulaka, the progenitor of the ksatriyas; abhavat—he became.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From Asmaka, Balika took birth.</p>
<p>Because Balika was surrounded by women and was therefore saved from the anger of Parasurama, he was known as Narikavaca (one who is protected by wome).</p>
<p>When Parasurama vanquished all the ksatriyas, Balika became the progenitor of more ksatriyas.</p>
<p>Therefore he was known as Mulaka, the root of the ksatriya dynasty.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Khatvanga was unconquerable in any fight.</p>
<p>Requested by the demigods to join them in fighting the demons, he won victory, and the demigods, being very pleased, wanted to give him a benediction.</p>
<p>The King inquired from them about the duration of his life and was informed that he had only one moment more.</p>
<p>Thus he immediately left his palace and went to his own residence, where he engaged his mind fully on the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The example of Maharaja Khatvanga in performing devotional service is brilliant.</p>
<p>Maharaja Khatvanga engaged himself for only a moment in devotional service to the Lord, but he was promoted back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one practices devotional service from the beginning of his life, surely he will return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt (asamsaya).</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the word asamsaya is used to describe the devotee.</p>
<p>There the Lord Himself gives this instruction:</p>
<p>mayy asakta-manah partha</p>
<p>yogam yunjan mad-asrayah</p>
<p>asamsayam samagram mam</p>
<p>yatha jnasyasi tac chrnu</p>
<p>Now hear, O son of Prtha (Arjuna), how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt (Bg.7.1) The Lord also instructs:</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna (Bg.4.9) Therefore, from the very beginning of one’s life one should practice bhakti-yoga, which increases one’s attachment for Krsna.</p>
<p>If one daily sees the Deity in the temple, makes offerings by worshiping the Deity, chants the holy name of the Personality of Godhead, and preaches about the glorious activities of the Lord as much as possible, he thus becomes attached to Krsna.</p>
<p>This attachment is called asakti.</p>
<p>When one’s mind is attached to Krsna (mayy asakta-manah), one can fulfill the mission of life in one human birth.</p>
<p>If one misses this opportunity, one does not know where he is going, how long he will remain in the cycle of birth and death, and when he will again achieve the human form of life and the chance to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The most intelligent person, therefore, uses every moment of his life to render loving service to the Lord.</p>

<p>Maharaja Khatvanga thought: Not even my life is dearer to me than the brahminical culture and the brahmanas, who are worshiped by my family.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of my kingdom, land, wife, children and opulence? Nothing is dearer to me than the brahmanas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Khatvanga, being in favor of the brahminical culture, wanted to utilize one moment’s time by fully surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord is worshiped with this prayer:</p>
<p>namo brahmanya-devaya</p>
<p>go brahmana-hitaya ca</p>
<p>jagad-dhitaya krsnaya</p>
<p>govindaya namo namah</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth, Krsna, who is the well-wisher of the cows and the brahmanas as well as the living entities in general.</p>
<p>I offer my repeated obeisances to Govinda, who is the pleasure reservoir for all the senses A devotee of Krsna is very much attached to brahminical culture.</p>
<p>Indeed, an expert personality who knows who Krsna is and what He wants is a real brahmana.</p>
<p>Brahma janatiti brahmanah.</p>
<p>Krsna is the Parabrahman, and therefore all Krsna conscious persons, or devotees of Krsna, are exalted brahmanas.</p>
<p>Khatvanga Maharaja regarded the devotees of Krsna as the real brahmanas and the real light for human society.</p>
<p>One who desires to advance in Krsna consciousness and spiritual understanding must give the utmost importance to brahminical culture and must understand Krsna (krsnaya govindaya).</p>
<p>Then his life will be successful.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I was never attracted, even in my childhood, by insignificant things or irreligious principles.</p>
<p>I did not find anything more substantial than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Khatvanga provides a typical example of a Krsna conscious person.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person does not see anything to be important but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor does he accept anything within this material world as being unconnected to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya8.274):</p>
<p>sthavara-jangama dekhe, na dekhe tara murti</p>
<p>sarvatra haya nija ista-deva-sphurti</p>
<p>The maha-bhagavata, the advanced devotee, certainly sees everything mobile and immobile, but he does not exactly see their forms.</p>
<p>Rather, everywhere he immediately sees manifest the form of the Supreme Lord Although a devotee is within the material world, he has no connection with it.</p>
<p>Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe.</p>
<p>He accepts this material world in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>A devotee may be engaged in earning money, but he uses that money for propagating the Krsna consciousness movement by constructing large temples and establishing worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Khatvanga Maharaja, therefore, was not a materialist.</p>
<p>A materialist is always attached to wife, children, home, property and many other things for sense gratification, but, as stated above, Khatvanga Maharaja was not attached to such things, nor could he think of anything existing without the purpose of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Isavasyam idam sarvam: everything is related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Of course, this consciousness is not for the ordinary person, but if one takes to the path of devotional service, as prescribed in The Nectar of Devotion, he can be trained in this consciousness and attain perfect understanding.</p>
<p>For a Krsna conscious person, nothing is palatable without a relationship with Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The demigods, the directors of the three worlds, wanted to give me whatever benediction I desired.</p>
<p>I did not want their benedictions, however, because I am interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created everything in this material world.</p>
<p>I am more interested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead than in all material benedictions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A devotee is always transcendentally situated param drstva nivartate: one who has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead is no longer interested in material sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Even such an exalted devotee as Dhruva Maharaja went to the forest for the sake of material benefit, but when he actually saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any material benediction.</p>
<p>He said, svamin krtartho ’smi varam na yace: My dear Lord, I am fully satisfied with whatever You have given me or not given me.</p>
<p>I have nothing to ask from You, for I am fully satisfied to be engaged in Your service This is the mentality of a pure devotee, who does not want anything, material or spiritual, from the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Our Krsna consciousness movement is therefore called krsna-bhavanamrta-sangha, the association of persons who are simply satisfied in thoughts of Krsna.</p>
<p>Being absorbed in thoughts of Krsna is neither expensive nor troublesome.</p>
<p>Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru: Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me (Bg.9.34) Anyone can always think of Krsna, without difficulties or obstacles.</p>
<p>This is called krsna-bhavanamrta.</p>
<p>One who is absorbed in krsna-bhavanamrta has no material benefits to ask from Krsna.</p>
<p>Instead, such a person prays to the Lord for the benediction of being able to spread His glories all over the world.</p>
<p>Mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person does not even want to stop his cycle of birth and death.</p>
<p>He simply prays, I may take birth as You like, but my only prayer is that I may be engaged in Your service</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Even though the demigods have the advantages of being situated in the higher planetary system, their minds, senses and intelligence are agitated by material conditions.</p>
<p>Therefore, even such elevated persons fail to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is eternally situated in the core of the heart.</p>
<p>What then is to be said of others, such as human beings, who have fewer advantages?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is a fact that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always situated in everyone’s heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati (Bg.18.61)).</p>
<p>But because of our material anxieties, which are inevitable in this material world, we cannot understand the Supreme Lord, although He is situated so near to us.</p>
<p>For those always agitated by material conditions, the yogic process is recommended so that one may concentrate his mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart.</p>
<p>Dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah (SB 12.13.1).</p>
<p>Because in material conditions the mind and senses are always agitated, by the yogic procedures like dharana, asana and dhyana one must quiet the mind and concentrate it upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In other words, the yogic process is a material attempt to realize the Lord, whereas bhakti, devotional service, is the spiritual process by which to realize Him.</p>
<p>Maharaja Khatvanga accepted the spiritual path, and therefore he was no longer interested in anything material.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), bhaktya mam abhijanati: Only by devotional service can I be understood One can understand Krsna, the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, only through devotional service.</p>
<p>The Lord never says that one can understand Him by performing mystic yoga or by philosophically speculating.</p>
<p>Bhakti is above all such material attempts.</p>
<p>Anyabhilasita-sunyam jnana-karmady-anavrtam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11).</p>
<p>Bhakti is uncontaminated, being unalloyed even by jnana or pious activities.</p>

<p>I should engage in thought of the Lord and should thus surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>This material creation, having been created by the external energy of the Lord, is like an imaginary town visualized on a hill or in a forest.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When passing through a mountainous region in an airplane, one may sometimes see a city in the sky with towers and palaces, or one may see similar things in a big forest.</p>
<p>This is called a gandharva-pura, a phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>This entire world resembles such a phantasmagoria, and every materially situated person has attachment for it.</p>
<p>But Khatvanga Maharaja, because of his advanced Krsna consciousness, was not interested in such things.</p>
<p>Even though a devotee may engage in apparently materialistic activities, he knows his position very well.</p>
<p>Nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate.</p>
<p>If one engages all material things in relation with the loving service of the Lord, one is situated in yukta-vairagya, proper renunciation.</p>
<p>In this material world, nothing should be accepted for one’s sense gratification: everything should be accepted for the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the mentality of the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Maharaja Khatvanga advises that one give up material attachments and surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus one achieves success in life.</p>

<p>The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases—as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.Bhagavan is the origin of everything.</p>
<p>Brahman is a partial representation of Bhagavan, and Vasudeva, the Supersoul living everywhere and in everyone’s heart, is also an advanced realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>But when one comes to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead (vasudevah samam iti), when one realizes that Vasudeva is both Paramatma and the impersonal Brahman, he is then in perfect knowledge.</p>
<p>Krsna is therefore described by Arjuna as param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12).</p>
<p>The words param brahma refer to the shelter of the impersonal Brahman and also of the all-pervading Supersoul.</p>
<p>When Krsna says tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti (Bg.4.9), this means that the perfect devotee, after perfect realization, returns home, back to Godhead.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-8" id="summary-8">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#910" id="910">9.10</a></h3>
<p>This Tenth Chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra appeared in the dynasty of Maharaja Khatvanga.</p>
<p>It also describes the Lord’s activities, telling how He killed Ravana and returned to Ayodhya, the capital of His kingdom.</p>
<p>The son of Maharaja Khatvanga was Dirghabahu, and his son was Raghu.</p>
<p>The son of Raghu was Aja, the son of Aja was Dasaratha, and the son of Dasaratha was Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When the Lord descended into this world in His full quadruple expansion—as Lord Ramacandra, Laksmana, Bharata and Satrughna—great sages like Valmiki who were actually in knowledge of the Absolute Truth described His transcendental pastimes.</p>
<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami describes these pastimes in brief.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra went with Visvamitra and killed Raksasas like Marica.</p>
<p>After breaking the stout and strong bow known as Haradhanu, the Lord married mother Sita and cut down the prestige of Parasurama.</p>
<p>To obey the order of His father, He entered the forest, accompanied by Laksmana and Sita.</p>
<p>There He cut off the nose of Surpanakha and killed the associates of Ravana, headed by Khara and Dusana.</p>
<p>Ravana’s kidnapping of Sitadevi was the beginning of this demon’s misfortune.</p>
<p>When Marica assumed the form of a golden deer, Lord Ramacandra went to bring the deer to please Sitadevi, but in the meantime Ravana took advantage of the Lord’s absence to kidnap her.</p>
<p>When Sitadevi was kidnapped, Lord Ramacandra, accompanied by Laksmana, searched for her throughout the forest.</p>
<p>In the course of this search, They met Jatayu.</p>
<p>Then the Lord killed the demon Kabandha and the commander Vali and established a friendly relationship with Sugriva.</p>
<p>After organizing the military strength of the monkeys and going with them to the shore of the sea, the Lord awaited the arrival of Samudra, the ocean personified, but when Samudra did not come, the Lord, the master of Samudra, became angry.</p>
<p>Then Samudra came to the Lord with great haste and surrendered to Him, wanting to help Him in every way.</p>
<p>The Lord then attempted to bridge the ocean, and, with the help of advice from Vibhisana, He attacked Ravana’s capital, Lanka.</p>
<p>Previously, Hanuman, the eternal servant of the Lord, had set fire to Lanka, and now, with the help of Laksmana, the forces of Lord Ramacandra killed all the Raksasa soldiers.</p>
<p>Then Lord Ramacandra personally killed Ravana.</p>
<p>Mandodari and other wives lamented for Ravana, and in accordance with Lord Ramacandra’s order, Vibhisana performed the funeral ceremonies for all the dead in the family.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra then gave Vibhisana the right to rule Lanka and also granted him a long duration of life.</p>
<p>The Lord delivered Sitadevi from the Asoka forest and carried her in a flower airplane to His capital Ayodhya, where He was received by His brother Bharata.</p>
<p>When Lord Ramacandra entered Ayodhya, Bharata brought His wooden shoes, Vibhisana and Sugriva held a whisk and fan, Hanuman carried an umbrella, Satrughna carried the Lord’s bow and two quivers, and Sitadevi carried a waterpot containing water from holy places.</p>
<p>Angada carried a sword, and Jambavan (Rksaraja) carried a shield.</p>
<p>After Lord Ramacandra, accompanied by Lord Laksmana and mother Sitadevi, met all His relatives, the great sage Vasistha enthroned Him as King.</p>
<p>The chapter ends with a short description of Lord Ramacandra’s rule in Ayodhya.</p>

<p>O King Pariksit, the transcendental activities of Lord Ramacandra have been described by great saintly persons who have seen the truth.</p>
<p>Because you have heard again and again about Lord Ramacandra, the husband of mother Sita, I shall describe these activities only in brief.</p>
<p>Please listen.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Modern Raksasas, posing as educationally advanced merely because they have doctorates, have tried to prove that Lord Ramacandra is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead but an ordinary person.</p>
<p>But those who are learned and spiritually advanced will never accept such notions; they will accept the descriptions of Lord Ramacandra and His activities only as presented by tattva-darsis, those who know the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.34) the Supreme Personality of Godhead advises:</p>
<p>tad viddhi pranipatena</p>
<p>pariprasnena sevaya</p>
<p>upadeksyanti te jnanam</p>
<p>jnaninas tattva-darsinah</p>
<p>Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.</p>
<p>Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth Unless one is tattva-darsi, in complete knowledge of the Absolute Truth, one cannot describe the activities of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore although there are many so-called Ramayanas, or histories of Lord Ramacandra’s activities, some of them are not actually authoritative.</p>
<p>Sometimes Lord Ramacandra’s activities are described in terms of one’s own imaginations, speculations or material sentiments.</p>
<p>But the characteristics of Lord Ramacandra should not be handled as something imaginary.</p>
<p>While describing the history of Lord Ramacandra, Sukadeva Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit, You have already heard about the activities of Lord Ramacandra Apparently, therefore, five thousand years ago there were many Ramayanas, or histories of Lord Ramacandra’s activities, and there are many still.</p>
<p>But we must select only those books written by tattva-darsis (jnaninas tattva-darsinah), not the books of so-called scholars who claim knowledge only on the basis of a doctorate.</p>
<p>This is a warning by Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>
<p>Rsibhis tattva-darsibhih.</p>
<p>Although the Ramayana composed by Valmiki is a huge literature, the same activities are summarized here by Sukadeva Gosvami in a few verses.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To keep the promise of His father intact, Lord Ramacandra immediately gave up the position of king and, accompanied by His wife, mother Sita, wandered from one forest to another on His lotus feet, which were so delicate that they were unable to bear even the touch of Sita’s palms.</p>
<p>The Lord was also accompanied by Hanuman (or by another monkey, Sugriva), king of the monkeys, and by His own younger brother Lord Laksmana, both of whom gave Him relief from the fatigue of wandering in the forest.</p>
<p>Having cut off the nose and ears of Surpanakha, thus disfiguring her, the Lord was separated from mother Sita.</p>
<p>He therefore became angry, moving His eyebrows and thus frightening the ocean, who then allowed the Lord to construct a bridge to cross the ocean.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Lord entered the kingdom of Ravana to kill him, like a fire devouring a forest.</p>
<p>May that Supreme Lord, Ramacandra, give us all protection.</p>

<p>O King, the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra were wonderful, like those of a baby elephant.</p>
<p>In the assembly where mother Sita was to choose her husband, in the midst of the heroes of this world, He broke the bow belonging to Lord Siva.</p>
<p>This bow was so heavy that it was carried by three hundred men, but Lord Ramacandra bent and strung it and broke it in the middle, just as a baby elephant breaks a stick of sugarcane.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord achieved the hand of mother Sita, who was equally as endowed with transcendental qualities of form, beauty, behavior, age and nature.</p>
<p>Indeed, she was the goddess of fortune who constantly rests on the chest of the Lord.</p>
<p>While returning from Sita’s home after gaining her at the assembly of competitors, Lord Ramacandra met Parasurama.</p>
<p>Although Parasurama was very proud, having rid the earth of the royal order twenty-one times, he was defeated by the Lord, who appeared to be a ksatriya of the royal order.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Ramacandra entered the forest and Laksmana was also absent, the worst of the Raksasas, Ravana, kidnapped Sitadevi, the daughter of the King of Videha, just as a tiger seizes unprotected sheep when the shepherd is absent.</p>
<p>Then Lord Ramacandra wandered in the forest with His brother Laksmana as if very much distressed due to separation from His wife.</p>
<p>Thus He showed by His personal example the condition of a person attached to women.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the words stri-sanginam gatim iti indicate that the condition of a person attached to women was shown by the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>According to moral instructions, grhe narim vivarjayet: when one goes on a tour, one should not bring his wife.</p>
<p>Formerly men used to travel without conveyances, but still, as far as possible, when one leaves home one should not take his wife with him, especially if one is in such a condition as Lord Ramacandra when banished by the order of His father.</p>
<p>Whether in the forest or at home, if one is attached to women this attachment is always troublesome, as shown by the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His personal example.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the material side of stri-sangi, but the situation of Lord Ramacandra is spiritual, for He does not belong to the material world.</p>
<p>Narayanah paro ’vyaktat: Narayana is beyond the material creation.</p>
<p>Because He is the creator of the material world, He is not subject to the conditions of the material world.</p>
<p>The separation of Lord Ramacandra from Sita is spiritually understood as vipralambha, which is an activity of the hladini potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead belonging to the srngara-rasa, the mellow of conjugal love in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>In the spiritual world the Supreme Personality of Godhead has all the dealings of love, displaying the symptoms called sattvika, sancari, vilapa, murccha and unmada.</p>
<p>Thus when Lord Ramacandra was separated from Sita, all these spiritual symptoms were manifested.</p>
<p>The Lord is neither impersonal nor impotent.</p>
<p>Rather, He is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), the eternal form of knowledge and bliss.</p>
<p>Thus He has all the symptoms of spiritual bliss.</p>
<p>Feeling separation from one’s beloved is also an item of spiritual bliss.</p>
<p>As explained by Srila Svarupa Damodara Gosvami, radha-krsna-pranaya-vikrtir hladini-saktih: the dealings of love between Radha and Krsna are displayed as the pleasure potency of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is the original source of all pleasure, the reservoir of all pleasure.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra, therefore, manifested the truth both spiritually and materially.</p>
<p>Materially those who are attached to women suffer, but spiritually when there are feelings of separation between the Lord and His pleasure potency the spiritual bliss of the Lord increases.</p>
<p>This is further explained in Bhagavad-gita (9.11):</p>
<p>avajananti mam mudha</p>
<p>manusim tanum asritam</p>
<p>param bhavam ajananto</p>
<p>mama bhuta-mahesvaram</p>
<p>One who does not know the spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead thinks of the Lord as an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>But the Lord’s mind, intelligence and senses can never be affected by material conditions.</p>
<p>This fact is further explained in the Skanda Purana, as quoted by Madhvacarya:</p>
<p>nitya-purna-sukha-jnana-</p>
<p>svarupo ’sau yato vibhuh</p>
<p>ato ’sya rama ity akhya</p>

<p>ramo ramo rama iti</p>
<p>sarvesam abhavat tada</p>
<p>sarvoramamayo loko</p>
<p>yada ramas tv apalayat</p>
<p>It was actually impossible for Ravana to take away Sita.</p>
<p>The form of Sita taken by Ravana was an illusory representation of mother Sita—maya-sita.</p>
<p>When Sita was tested in the fire, this maya-sita was burnt, and the real Sita came out of the fire.</p>
<p>A further understanding to be derived from this example is that a woman, however powerful she may be in the material world, must be given protection, for as soon as she is unprotected she will be exploited by Raksasas like Ravana.</p>
<p>Here the words vaideha-raja-duhitari indicate that before mother Sita was married to Lord Ramacandra she was protected by her father, Vaideha-raja.</p>
<p>And when she was married she was protected by her husband.</p>
<p>Therefore the conclusion is that a woman should always be protected.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic rule, there is no scope for a woman’s being independent (asamaksam), for a woman cannot protect herself independently.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; tvam—Your Lordship; vayam—we; jada-dhiyah—dull-minded, possessing blunt intelligence; nu—indeed; vidamah—can know; bhuman—O Supreme; kuta-stham—within the core of the heart; adi-purusam—the original Personality of Godhead; jagatam—of the universes, which progressively go on; adhisam—the supreme master; yat—fixed under Your direction; sattvatah—infatuated with sattva-guna; sura-ganah—such demigods; rajasah—infatuated with rajo-guna; praja-isah—the Prajapatis; manyoh—influenced by tamo-guna; ca—and; bhuta-patayah—rulers of ghosts; sah—such a personality; bhavan—Your Lordship; guna-isah—the master of all three modes of material nature.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O all-pervading Supreme Person, we are dull-minded and did not understand who You are, but now we understand that You are the Supreme Person, the master of the entire universe, the unchanging and original Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The demigods are infatuated with the mode of goodness, the Prajapatis with the mode of passion, and the lord of ghosts with the mode of ignorance, but You are the master of all these qualities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word jada-dhiyah refers to intelligence like that of an animal.</p>
<p>A person with such intelligence cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Without being beaten, an animal cannot understand the purpose of a man.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who are dull-minded cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when punished severely by the modes of material nature, they begin to understand Him.</p>
<p>A Hindi poet has said:</p>
<p>duhkha se saba hari bhaje</p>
<p>sukha se bhaje koi</p>
<p>sukha se agar hari bhaje</p>
<p>duhkha kathan se haya</p>
<p>When one is distressed he goes to the church or temple to worship the Lord, but when opulent he forgets the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, punishment by the Lord through material nature is necessary in human society, for without it men forget the supremacy of the Lord due to their dull, blunt intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>kamam—as You like; prayahi—You may go over my water; jahi—just conquer; visravasah—of Visrava Muni; avameham—pollution, like urine; trailokya—for the three worlds; ravanam—the person known as Ravana, the cause of weeping; avapnuhi—regain; vira—O great hero; patnim—Your wife; badhnihi—just construct; setum—a bridge; iha—here (on this water); te—of Your good self; yasasah—fame; vitatyai—to expand; gayanti—will glorify; dik-vijayinah—great heroes who have conquered all directions; yam—which (bridge); upetya—coming near; bhupah—great kings.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My Lord, You may use my water as You like.</p>
<p>Indeed, You may cross it and go to the abode of Ravana, who is the great source of disturbance and crying for the three worlds.</p>
<p>He is the son of Visrava, but is condemned like urine.</p>
<p>Please go kill him and thus regain Your wife, Sitadevi.</p>
<p>O great hero, although my water presents no impediment to Your going to Lanka, please construct a bridge over it to spread Your transcendental fame.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this wonderfully uncommon deed of Your Lordship, all the great heroes and kings in the future will glorify You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that a son and urine emanate from the same source—the genitals.</p>
<p>When a son is a devotee or a great learned person, the seminal discharge for begetting a son is successful, but if the son is unqualified and brings no glory to his family, he is no better than urine.</p>
<p>Here Ravana is compared to urine because he was a cause of disturbances to the three worlds.</p>
<p>Thus the ocean personified wanted him killed by Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>One feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra is omnipotence.</p>
<p>The Lord can act without regard to material impediments or inconveniences, but to prove that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and was not merely advertised as Godhead or elected by popular vote, He constructed a wonderful bridge over the ocean.</p>
<p>Nowadays it has become fashionable to create some artificial God who performs no uncommon activities; a little magic will bewilder a foolish person into selecting an artificial God because he does not understand how powerful God is.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra, however, constructed a bridge over the water with stone by making the stone float.</p>
<p>This is proof of God’s uncommonly wonderful power.</p>
<p>Why should someone be accepted as God without displaying extraordinary potency by doing something never to be done by any common man? We accept Lord Ramacandra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He constructed this bridge, and we accept Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He lifted Govardhana Hill when He was only seven years old.</p>
<p>We should not accept any rascal as God or an incarnation of God, for God displays special features in His various activities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna The activities of the Lord are not common; they are all transcendentally wonderful and not able to be performed by any other living being.</p>
<p>The symptoms of the Lord’s activities are all mentioned in the sastras, and after one understands them one can accept the Lord as He is.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: After constructing a bridge over the ocean by throwing into the water the peaks of mountains whose trees and other vegetation had been shaken by the hands of great monkeys, Lord Ramacandra went to Lanka to release Sitadevi from the clutches of Ravana.</p>
<p>With the direction and help of Vibhisana, Ravana’s brother, the Lord, along with the monkey soldiers, headed by Sugriva, Nila and Hanuman, entered Ravana’s kingdom, Lanka, which had previously been burnt by Hanuman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Great mountain peaks covered with trees and plants were thrown into the sea by the monkey soldiers and began to float by the supreme will of the Lord.</p>
<p>By the supreme will of the Lord, many great planets float weightlessly in space like swabs of cotton.</p>
<p>If this is possible, why should great mountain peaks not be able to float on water? This is the omnipotence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He can do anything and everything He likes, because He is not under the control of the material nature; indeed, material nature is controlled by Him.</p>
<p>Mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sacaracaram: (Bg.9.10) only under His direction does prakrti, or material nature, work.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.52):</p>
<p>yasyajnaya bhramati sambhrta-kala-cakro</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>Describing how material nature works, the Brahma-samhita says that the sun moves as desired by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Consequently, for Lord Ramacandra to construct a bridge over the Indian Ocean with the help of monkey soldiers who threw great mountain peaks into the water is not at all wonderful; it is wonderful only in the sense that it has kept the name and fame of Lord Ramacandra eternally celebrated.</p>

<p>Angada and the other commanders of the soldiers of Ramacandra faced the elephants, infantry, horses and chariots of the enemy and hurled against them big trees, mountain peaks, clubs and arrows.</p>
<p>Thus the soldiers of Lord Ramacandra killed Ravana’s soldiers, who had lost all good fortune because Ravana had been condemned by the anger of mother Sita.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The soldiers Lord Ramacandra recruited in the jungle were all monkeys and did not have proper equipment with which to fight the soldiers of Ravana, for Ravana’s soldiers were equipped with weapons of modern warfare whereas the monkeys could only throw stones, mountain peaks and trees.</p>
<p>It was only Lord Ramacandra and Laksmana who shot some arrows.</p>
<p>But because the soldiers of Ravana were condemned by the curse of mother Sita, the monkeys were able to kill them simply by throwing stones and trees.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of strength—daiva and purusakara.</p>

<p>This is the disqualification of the Raksasas.</p>
<p>Asatyam apratistham te jagad ahur anisvaram (Bg.16.8).</p>
<p>The Raksasas are unaware that the Supreme Lord is the ruler of the creation.</p>
<p>They think that everything has come about by chance or accident and that there is no ruler, king or controller.</p>
<p>Therefore the Raksasas act independently, as they like, going even so far as to kidnap the goddess of fortune.</p>
<p>This policy of Ravana’s is extremely dangerous for the materialist; indeed, it brings ruin to the materialistic civilization.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, because atheists are Raksasas, they dare to do things that are most abominable, and thus they are punished without fail.</p>
<p>Religion consists of the orders of the Supreme Lord, and one who carries out these orders is religious.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After thus rebuking Ravana, Lord Ramacandra fixed an arrow to His bow, aimed at Ravana, and released the arrow, which pierced Ravana’s heart like a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Ravana’s followers raised a tumultuous sound, crying, Alas! Alas! What has happened? What has happened as Ravana, vomiting blood from his ten mouths, fell from his airplane, just as a pious man falls to earth from the heavenly planets when the results of his pious activities are exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (9.21) it is said, ksine punye martya-lokam visanti: When the results of their pious activities are exhausted, those who have enjoyed in the heavenly planets fall again to earth The fruitive activities of this material world are such that whether one acts piously or impiously one must remain within the material world according to different conditions, for neither pious nor impious actions can relieve one from maya’s clutches of repeated birth and death.</p>
<p>Somehow or other, Ravana was raised to an exalted position as the king of a great kingdom with all material opulences, but because of his sinful act of kidnapping mother Sita, all the results of his pious activities were destroyed.</p>
<p>If one offends an exalted personality, especially the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one certainly becomes most abominable; bereft of the results of pious activities, one must fall down like Ravana and other demons.</p>
<p>It is therefore advised that one transcend both pious and impious activities and remain in the pure state of freedom from all designations (sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam (Cc.Madhya 19.170)).</p>
<p>When one is fixed in devotional service, he is above the material platform.</p>
<p>On the material platform there are higher and lower positions, but when one is above the material platform he is always fixed in a spiritual position (sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate (Bg.14.26)).</p>
<p>Ravana or those like him may be very powerful and opulent in this material world, but theirs is not a secure position, because, after all, they are bound by the results of their karma (karmana daiva-netrena).</p>
<p>We should not forget that we are completely dependent on the laws of nature prakrteh kriyamanani</p>
<p>gunaih karmani sarvasah</p>
<p>ahankara-vimudhatma</p>
<p>kartaham iti manyate</p>
<p>The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature (Bg.3.27) One should not be proud of one’s exalted position and act like Ravana, thinking oneself independent of material nature’s laws.</p>

<p>There are many instances of this in the history of Vedic literature.</p>
<p>Whenever we find a description of ideal chaste women, mother Sita is among them.</p>
<p>Mandodari, the wife of Ravana, was also very chaste.</p>
<p>Similarly, Draupadi was one of five exalted chaste women.</p>
<p>As a man must follow great personalities like Brahma and Narada, a woman must follow the path of such ideal women as Sita, Mandodari and Draupadi.</p>
<p>By staying chaste and faithful to her husband, a woman enriches herself with supernatural power.</p>
<p>It is a moral principle that one should not be influenced by lusty desires for another’s wife.</p>
<p>Matrvat para-daresu: an intelligent person must look upon another’s wife as being like his mother.</p>

<p>para-dravyesu lostravat</p>
<p>atmavat sarva-bhutesu</p>
<p>yah pasyati sa panditah</p>
<p>One who considers another’s wife as his mother, another’s possessions as a lump of dirt and treats all other living beings as he would himself, is considered to be learned Thus Ravana was condemned not only by Lord Ramacandra but even by his own wife, Mandodari.</p>
<p>Because she was a chaste woman, she knew the power of another chaste woman, especially such a wife as mother Sitadevi.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O pleasure of the Raksasa dynasty, because of you the state of Lanka and also we ourselves now have no protector.</p>
<p>By your deeds you have made your body fit to be eaten by vultures and your soul fit to go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who follows the path of Ravana is condemned in two ways: his body is fit to be eaten by dogs and vultures, and the soul goes to hell.</p>
<p>As stated by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (16.19):</p>
<p>tan aham dvisatah kruran</p>
<p>samsaresu naradhaman</p>
<p>ksipamy ajasram asubhan</p>
<p>asurisv eva yonisu</p>
<p>Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life Thus the destination of godless atheists such as Ravana, Hiranyakasipu, Kamsa and Dantavakra is a hellish condition of life.</p>
<p>Mandodari, the wife of Ravana, could understand all this because she was a chaste woman.</p>
<p>Although lamenting for the death of her husband, she knew what would happen to his body and soul, for although one cannot see directly with one’s material eyes, one can see with eyes of knowledge (pasyanti jnana-caksusah).</p>
<p>In Vedic history there are many instances of how one becomes godless and is condemned by the laws of nature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Vibhisana, the pious brother of Ravana and devotee of Lord Ramacandra, received approval from Lord Ramacandra, the King of Kosala.</p>
<p>Then he performed the prescribed funeral ceremonies for his family members to save them from the path to hell.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After giving up the body, one is transferred to another body, but sometimes, if one is too sinful, he is checked from transmigrating to another body, and thus he becomes a ghost.</p>
<p>To save a diseased person from ghostly life, the funeral ceremony, or sraddha ceremony, as prescribed in authorized sastra, must be performed.</p>
<p>Ravana was killed by Lord Ramacandra and was destined for hellish life, but by Lord Ramacandra’s advice, Vibhisana, Ravana’s brother, performed all the duties prescribed in relation to the dead.</p>
<p>Thus Lord Ramacandra was kind to Ravana even after Ravana’s death.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Being pleased by the full surrender and submission of Lord Bharata, Lord Ramacandra then accepted the throne of the state.</p>
<p>He cared for the citizens exactly like a father, and the citizens, being fully engaged in their occupational duties of varna and asrama, accepted Him as their father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>People are very fond of the pattern of Rama-rajya, and even today politicians sometimes form a party called Rama-rajya, but unfortunately they have no obedience to Lord Rama.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that people want the kingdom of God without God.</p>
<p>Such an aspiration, however, is never to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Good government can exist when the relationship between the citizens and the government is like that exemplified by Lord Ramacandra and His citizens.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra ruled His kingdom exactly as a father takes care of his children, and the citizens, being obliged to the good government of Lord Ramacandra, accepted the Lord as their father.</p>
<p>Thus the relationship between the citizens and the government should be exactly like that between father and son.</p>
<p>When the sons in a family are well trained, they are obedient to the father and mother, and when the father is well qualified, he takes good care of the children.</p>
<p>As indicated here by the words sva-dharma-nirata varnasrama-gunan-vitah, the people were good citizens because they accepted the institution of varna and asrama, which arranges society in the varna divisions of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra and the asrama divisions of brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.</p>
<p>This is actual human civilization.</p>
<p>People must be trained according to the different varnasrama occupational duties.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: the four varnas must be established according to varying qualities and work.</p>
<p>The first principle for good government is that it must institute this varnasrama system.</p>
<p>The purpose of varnasrama is to enable people to become God conscious.</p>
<p>Varnasramacaravata purusena parah puman visnur aradhyate.</p>
<p>The entire varnasrama scheme is intended to enable people to become Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Visnur asya devata.</p>
<p>When people worship Lord Visnu as the Supreme Lord, they become Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Thus people should be trained to become Vaisnavas through the system of varna and asrama, as they were during the reign of Lord Ramacandra, when everyone was fully trained to follow the varnasrama principles.</p>
<p>Simply enforcing laws and ordinances cannot make the citizens obedient and lawful.</p>
<p>That is impossible.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire world there are so many states, legislative assemblies and parliaments, but still the citizens are rogues and thieves.</p>
<p>Good citizenship, therefore, cannot be enforced; the citizens must be trained.</p>
<p>As there are schools and colleges to train students to become chemical engineers, lawyers or specialists in many other departments of knowledge, there must be schools and colleges to train students to become brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas, sudras, brahmacaris, grhasthas, vanaprasthas and sannyasis.</p>
<p>This will provide the preliminary condition for good citizenship (varnasrama-gunan-vitah).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if the king or president is a rajarsi, the relationship between the citizens and the chief executive will be clear, and there will be no possibility of disruption in the state, because the number of thieves and rogues will decrease.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, however, because the varnasrama system is neglected, people are generally thieves and rogues.</p>
<p>In the system of democracy, such thieves and rogues naturally collect money from other thieves and rogues, and thus there is chaos in every government, and no one is happy.</p>
<p>But here the example of good government is to be found in the reign of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>If people follow this example, there will be good government all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra became King during Treta-yuga, but because of His good government, the age was like Satya-yuga.</p>
<p>Everyone was religious and completely happy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Among the four yugas—Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali—the Kali-yuga is the worst, but if the process of varnasrama-dharma is introduced, even in this age of Kali, the situation of Satya-yuga can be invoked.</p>

<p>My dear King, although Kali-yuga is full of faults, there is still one good quality about this age: simply by chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, one can become free from material bondage and be promoted to the transcendental kingdom (Bhag.12.3.51) If people take to this sankirtana movement of chanting Hare Krsna, Hare Rama, they will certainly be freed from the contamination of Kali-yuga, and the people of this age will be happy, as people were in Satya-yuga, the golden age.</p>
<p>Anyone, anywhere, can easily take to this Hare Krsna movement; one need only chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, observe the rules and regulations, and stay free from the contamination of sinful life.</p>
<p>Even if one is sinful and cannot give up sinful life immediately, if he chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra with devotion and faith he will certainly be freed from all sinful activities, and his life will be successful.</p>
<p>Param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam.</p>
<p>This is the blessing of Lord Ramacandra, who has appeared in this age of Kali as Lord Gaurasundara.</p>

<p>When Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was the King of this world, all bodily and mental suffering, disease, old age, bereavement, lamentation, distress, fear and fatigue were completely absent.</p>

<p>All these facilities existed because of Lord Ramacandra’s presence as the King of the entire world.</p>
<p>A similar situation could be introduced immediately, even in this age called Kali, the worst of all ages.</p>
<p>It is said, kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: Krsna descends in this Kali-yuga in the form of His holy name—Hare Krsna, Hare Rama.</p>
<p>If we chant offenselessly, Rama and Krsna are still present in this age.</p>
<p>The kingdom of Rama was immensely popular and beneficial, and the spreading of this Hare Krsna movement can immediately introduce a similar situation, even in this Kali-yuga.</p>

<p>Lord Ramacandra took a vow to accept only one wife and have no connection with any other women.</p>
<p>He was a saintly king, and everything in His character was good, untinged by qualities like anger.</p>

<p>Thus He taught the general public by His personal activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Eka-patni-vrata, accepting only one wife, was the glorious example set by Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>One should not accept more than one wife.</p>
<p>In those days, of course, people did marry more than one wife.</p>
<p>Even Lord Ramacandra’s father accepted more wives than one.</p>
<p>But Lord Ramacandra, as an ideal king, accepted only one wife, mother Sita.</p>
<p>When mother Sita was kidnapped by Ravana and the Raksasas, Lord Ramacandra, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, could have married hundreds and thousands of Sitas, but to teach us how faithful He was to His wife, He fought with Ravana and finally killed him.</p>
<p>The Lord punished Ravana and rescued His wife to instruct men to have only one wife.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra accepted only one wife and manifested sublime character, thus setting an example for householders.</p>
<p>A householder should live according to the ideal of Lord Ramacandra, who showed how to be a perfect person.</p>
<p>Being a householder or living with a wife and children is never condemned, provided one lives according to the regulative principles of varnasrama-dharma.</p>
<p>Those who live in accordance with these principles, whether as householders, brahmacaris or vanaprasthas, are all equally important.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-9" id="summary-9">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#911-1" id="911-1">9.11</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Lord Ramacandra resided in Ayodhya with His younger brothers and performed various sacrifices.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, performed various sacrifices by which to worship Himself, and at the end of these sacrifices He gave land to the hota, adhvaryu, udgata and brahma priests.</p>
<p>He gave them the eastern, western, northern and southern directions respectively, and the balance He gave to the acarya.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra’s faith in the brahmanas and affection for His servants was observed by all the brahmanas, who then offered their prayers to the Lord and returned whatever they had taken from Him.</p>
<p>They regarded the enlightenment given to them by the Lord within the core of their hearts as a sufficient contribution.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra subsequently dressed Himself like an ordinary person and began wandering within the capital to understand what impression the citizens had of Him.</p>
<p>By chance, one night He heard a man talking to his wife, who had gone to another man’s house.</p>
<p>In the course of rebuking his wife, the man spoke suspiciously of the character of Sitadevi.</p>
<p>The Lord immediately returned home, and, fearing such rumors, He superficially decided to give up Sitadevi’s company.</p>
<p>Thus He banished Sitadevi, who was pregnant, to the shelter of Valmiki Muni, where she gave birth to twin sons, named Lava and Kusa.</p>
<p>In Ayodhya, Laksmana begot two sons named Angada and Citraketu, Bharata begot two sons named Taksa and Puskala, and Satrughna begot two sons named Subahu and Srutasena.</p>
<p>When Bharata went out to conquer various lands on behalf of the emperor, Lord Ramacandra, He fought many millions of Gandharvas.</p>
<p>By killing them in the fight, He acquired immense wealth, which He then brought home.</p>
<p>Satrughna killed a demon named Lavana at Madhuvana and thus established the capital of Mathura.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sitadevi placed her two sons in the care of Valmiki Muni and then entered into the earth.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of this, Lord Ramacandra was very much aggrieved, and thus He performed sacrifices for thirteen thousand years.</p>
<p>After describing the pastimes of Lord Ramacandra’s disappearance and establishing that the Lord appears for His pastimes only, Sukadeva Gosvami ends this chapter by describing the results of hearing about the activities of Lord Ramacandra and by describing how the Lord protected His citizens and displayed affection for His brothers.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: Thereafter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ramacandra, accepted an acarya and performed sacrifices (yajnas) with opulent paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Thus He Himself worshiped Himself, for He is the Supreme Lord of all demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sarvarhanam acyutejya.</p>
<p>If Acyuta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshiped, then everyone is worshiped.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.31.14):</p>
<p>yatha taror mula-nisecanena</p>
<p>trpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopasakhah</p>
<p>pranopaharac ca yathendriyanam</p>
<p>tathaiva sarvarhanam acyutejya</p>
<p>As pouring water on the root of a tree nourishes the trunk, branches, twigs and leaves, and as supplying food to the stomach enlivens the senses and limbs of the body, worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead satisfies the demigods, who are part of that Supreme Personality Performing yajna involves worshiping the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Here the Supreme Lord worshiped the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, bhagavan atmanatmanam ije: the Lord worshiped Himself by Himself.</p>
<p>This does not, of course, justify the Mayavada philosophy, by which one thinks himself the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The jiva, the living entity, is always different from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The living entities (vibhinnamsa) never become one with the Lord, although Mayavadis sometimes imitate the Lord’s worship of Himself.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna meditated upon Himself every morning as a grhastha, and similarly Lord Ramacandra performed yajnas to satisfy Himself, but this does not mean that an ordinary living being should imitate the Lord by accepting the process of ahangraha-upasana.</p>
<p>Such unauthorized worship is not recommended herein.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All the brahmanas who were engaged in the various activities of the sacrifice were very pleased with Lord Ramacandra, who was greatly affectionate and favorable to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Thus with melted hearts they returned all the property received from Him and spoke as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the previous chapter it was said that the prajas, the citizens, strictly followed the system of varnasrama-dharma.</p>
<p>The brahmanas acted exactly like brahmanas, the ksatriyas exactly like ksatriyas, and so on.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Lord Ramacandra gave everything in charity to the brahmanas, the brahmanas, being qualified, wisely considered that brahmanas are not meant to possess property to make a profit from it.</p>
<p>The qualifications of a brahmana are given in Bhagavad-gita (18.42): samo damas tapah saucam</p>
<p>ksantir arjavam eva ca</p>
<p>jnanam vijnanam astikyam</p>
<p>brahma-karma svabhavajam</p>
<p>Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness—these are the qualities by which the brahmanas work The brahminical character offers no scope for possessing land and ruling citizens; these are the duties of a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the brahmanas did not refuse Lord Ramacandra’s gift, after accepting it they returned it to the King.</p>
<p>The brahmanas were so pleased with Lord Ramacandra’s affection toward them that their hearts melted.</p>
<p>They saw that Lord Ramacandra, aside from being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was fully qualified as a ksatriya and was exemplary in character.</p>
<p>One of the qualifications of a ksatriya is to be charitable.</p>
<p>A ksatriya, or ruler, levies taxes upon the citizens not for his personal sense gratification but to give charity in suitable cases.</p>
<p>Danam isvara-bhavah.</p>
<p>On one hand, ksatriyas have the propensity to rule, but on the other they are very liberal with charity.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Yudhisthira gave charity, he engaged Karna to take charge of distributing it.</p>
<p>Karna was very famous as Data Karna.</p>
<p>The word data refers to one who gives charity very liberally.</p>
<p>The kings always kept a large quantity of food grains in stock, and whenever there was any scarcity of grains, they would distribute grains in charity.</p>
<p>A ksatriya’s duty is to give charity, and a brahmana’s duty is to accept charity, but not more than needed to maintain body and soul together.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the brahmanas were given so much land by Lord Ramacandra, they returned it to Him and were not greedy.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Lord, You are the master of the entire universe.</p>
<p>What have You not given to us? You have entered the core of our hearts and dissipated the darkness of our ignorance by Your effulgence.</p>
<p>This is the supreme gift.</p>
<p>We do not need a material donation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Dhruva Maharaja was offered a benediction by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he replied, O my Lord, I am fully satisfied.</p>
<p>I do not need any material benediction Similarly, when Prahlada Maharaja was offered a benediction by Lord Nrsimhadeva, he also refused to accept it and instead declared that a devotee should not be like a vanik, a mercantile man who gives something in exchange for some profit.</p>
<p>One who becomes a devotee for some material profit is not a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Brahmanas are always enlightened by the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart (sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>And because the brahmanas and Vaisnavas are always directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are not greedy for material wealth.</p>
<p>What is absolutely necessary they possess, but they do not want an expanded kingdom.</p>
<p>An example of this was given by Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>Acting as a brahmacari, Lord Vamanadeva wanted only three paces of land.</p>
<p>Aspiring to possess more and more for personal sense gratification is simply ignorance, and this ignorance is conspicuous by its absence from the heart of a brahmana or Vaisnava.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After completing the sacrifice, Lord Ramacandra, whose lotus feet were sometimes pierced by thorns when He lived in Dandakaranya, placed those lotus feet in the hearts of those who always think of Him.</p>
<p>Then He entered His own abode, the Vaikuntha planet beyond the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The lotus feet of the Lord are always a subject matter for meditation for devotees.</p>
<p>Sometimes when Lord Ramacandra wandered in the forest of Dandakaranya, thorns pricked His lotus feet.</p>
<p>The devotees, upon thinking of this, would faint.</p>
<p>The Lord does not feel pain or pleasure from any action or reaction of this material world, but the devotees cannot tolerate even the pricking of the Lord’s lotus feet by a thorn.</p>
<p>This was the attitude of the gopis when they thought of Krsna wandering in the forest, with pebbles and grains of sand pricking His lotus feet.</p>
<p>This tribulation in the heart of a devotee cannot be understood by karmis, jnanis or yogis.</p>
<p>The devotees, who could not tolerate even thinking of the Lord’s lotus feet being pricked by a thorn, were again put into tribulation by thinking of the Lord’s disappearance, for the Lord had to return to His abode after finishing His pastimes in this material world.</p>
<p>The word atma-jyotih is significant.</p>
<p>The brahmajyoti, which is greatly appreciated by jnanis, or monistic philosophers who desire to enter it for liberation, is nothing but the rays of the Lord’s body yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti-</p>
<p>kotisv asesa-vasudhadi-vibhuti-bhinnam</p>
<p>tad brahma niskalam anantam asesa-bhutam</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power.</p>
<p>The glowing effulgence of His transcendental form is the impersonal Brahman, which is absolute, complete and unlimited and which displays the varieties of countless planets, with their different opulences, in millions and millions of universes (Brahma-samhita5.40) The brahmajyoti is the beginning of the spiritual world, and beyond the brahmajyoti are the Vaikuntha planets.</p>
<p>In other words, the brahmajyoti stays outside the Vaikuntha planets, just as the sunshine stays outside the sun.</p>
<p>To enter the sun planet, one must go through the sunshine.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the Lord or His devotees enter the Vaikuntha planets, they go through the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>The jnanis, or monistic philosophers, because of their impersonal conception of the Lord, cannot enter the Vaikuntha planets, but they also cannot stay eternally in the brahmajyoti.</p>
<p>Thus after some time they fall again to this material world.</p>
<p>Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adho ’nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah (Bhag.10.2.32).</p>
<p>The Vaikuntha planets are covered by the brahmajyoti, and therefore one cannot properly understand what those Vaikuntha planets are unless one is a pure devotee.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra’s reputation for having killed Ravana with showers of arrows at the request of the demigods and for having built a bridge over the ocean does not constitute the factual glory of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Ramacandra, whose spiritual body is always engaged in various pastimes.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra has no equal or superior, and therefore He had no need to take help from the monkeys to gain victory over Ravana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Vedas (Svetasvatara Upanisad6.8):</p>

<p>na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate</p>
<p>parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate</p>
<p>svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord has nothing to do, and no one is found to be equal to or greater than Him, for everything is done naturally and systematically by His multifarious energies The Lord has nothing to do (na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate); whatever He does is His pastime.</p>
<p>The Lord has no duty to perform to oblige anyone.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, He appears to act to protect His devotees or kill His enemies.</p>
<p>Of course, no one can be the Lord’s enemy, since who could be more powerful than the Lord? There is actually no question of anyone’s being His enemy, but when the Lord wants to take pleasure in pastimes, He comes down to this material world and acts like a human being, thus showing His wonderful, glorious activities to please the devotees.</p>
<p>His devotees always want to see the Lord victorious in varied activities, and therefore, to please Himself and them, the Lord sometimes agrees to act as a human being and perform wonderful, uncommon pastimes for the satisfaction of the devotees.</p>

<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):</p>

<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna Here this is confirmed.</p>
<p>All the inhabitants of Ayodhya who saw Lord Ramacandra as citizens, served Him as servants, sat and talked with Him as friends or were somehow or other present during His reign went back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>After giving up the body, the devotee who becomes perfect in devotional service enters that particular universe where Lord Ramacandra or Lord Krsna is engaged in His pastimes.</p>
<p>Then, after being trained to serve the Lord in various capacities in that prakata-lila, the devotee is finally promoted to sanatana-dhama, the supreme abode in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>This sanatana-dhama is also mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (paras tasmat tu bhavo ’nyo’vyakto’vyaktat sanatanah (Bg.8.20)).</p>
<p>One who enters the transcendental pastimes of the Lord is called nitya-lila-pravista.</p>
<p>To understand clearly why Lord Ramacandra returned, it is mentioned herewith that the Lord went to that particular place where the bhakti-yogis go.</p>
<p>The impersonalists misunderstand the statements of Srimad-Bhagavatam to mean that the Lord entered His own effulgence and therefore become impersonal.</p>
<p>But the Lord is a person, and His devotees are persons.</p>
<p>Indeed, the living entities, like the Lord, were persons in the past, they are persons in the present, and they will continue to be persons even after giving up the body.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, anyone who aurally receives the narrations concerning the characteristics of Lord Ramacandra’s pastimes will ultimately be freed from the disease of envy and thus be liberated from the bondage of fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here in this material world, everyone is envious of someone else.</p>
<p>Even in religious life, it is sometimes found that if one devotee has advanced in spiritual activities, other devotees are envious of him.</p>
<p>Such envious devotees are not completely freed from the bondage of birth and death.</p>
<p>As long as one is not completely free from the cause of birth and death, one cannot enter the sanatana-dhama or the eternal pastimes of the Lord.</p>
<p>One becomes envious because of being influenced by the designations of the body, but the liberated devotee has nothing to do with the body, and therefore he is completely on the transcendental platform.</p>
<p>A devotee is never envious of anyone, even his enemy.</p>
<p>Because the devotee knows that the Lord is his supreme protector, he thinks, What harm can the so-called enemy do Thus a devotee is confident about his protection.</p>
<p>The Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham: (Bg.4.11) According to the proportion of one’s surrender unto Me, I respond accordingly A devotee must therefore be completely free from envy, especially of other devotees.</p>
<p>To envy other devotees is a great offense, a vaisnava-aparadha.</p>
<p>A devotee who constantly engages in hearing and chanting (sravana-kirtana) is certainly freed from the disease of envy, and thus he becomes eligible to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami replied: After accepting the throne of the government by the fervent request of His younger brother Bharata, Lord Ramacandra ordered His younger brothers to go out and conquer the entire world, while He personally remained in the capital to give audience to all the citizens and residents of the palace and supervise the governmental affairs with His other assistants.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead does not allow any of His devotees or assistants to be engaged in sense gratification.</p>
<p>The younger brothers of Lord Ramacandra were at home enjoying the personal presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the Lord ordered Them to go out and achieve victory all over the world.</p>
<p>It was the custom (and this custom, in some places, is still current) that all other kings would have to accept the supremacy of the emperor.</p>
<p>If the king of a small state did not accept the emperor’s supremacy, there would be a fight, and the king of the small state would be obliged to accept the emperor as supreme; otherwise, it would not be possible for the emperor to rule the country.</p>
<p>Lord Ramacandra showed His favor to His brothers by ordering Them to go out.</p>
<p>Many of the Lord’s devotees residing in Vrndavana have taken the vow not to leave Vrndavana to preach Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>But the Lord says that Krsna consciousness should be spread all over the world, in every village and every town.</p>
<p>This is the open order of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu prthivite ache yata nagaradi grama</p>

<p>A devotee must carry out the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, yare dekha, tare kaha ‘krsna’-upadesa (Cc.Madhya 7.128).</p>
<p>Every devotee, therefore, should spread Krsna consciousness by preaching, asking whomever he meets to accept the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me This is the order of the Lord, who speaks as the supreme emperor.</p>
<p>Everyone should be induced to accept this order, for this is victory (dig-vijaya).</p>
<p>And it is the duty of the soldier, the devotee, to impress upon everyone this philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Of course, those who are kanistha-adhikaris do not preach, but the Lord shows mercy to them also, as He did by staying personally in Ayodhya to give audience to the people in general.</p>
<p>One should not mistakenly think that the Lord asked His younger brothers to leave Ayodhya because He especially favored the citizens.</p>
<p>The Lord is merciful to everyone, and He knows how to show His favor to each individual person according to his capacity.</p>
<p>One who abides by the order of the Lord is a pure devotee.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>During the reign of Lord Ramacandra, the streets of the capital, Ayodhya, were sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, thrown about by elephants from their trunks.</p>
<p>When the citizens saw the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the city in such opulence, they appreciated this opulence very much.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>We have simply heard about the opulence of Rama-rajya during the reign of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>Now, here is one example of the opulence of the Lord’s kingdom.</p>
<p>The streets of Ayodhya were not only cleaned but also sprinkled with perfumed water and drops of perfumed liquor, which were distributed by elephants through their trunks.</p>
<p>There was no need of sprinkling machines, for the elephant has a natural ability to suck water through its trunk and again throw it out in a shower.</p>
<p>We can understand the opulence of the city from this one example: it was actually sprinkled with perfumed water.</p>
<p>Moreover, the citizens had the opportunity to see the Lord personally supervising the affairs of the state.</p>
<p>He was not a sleeping monarch, as we can understand from His activities in sending His brothers to see to affairs outside the capital and punish anyone who did not obey the emperor’s orders.</p>
<p>This is called dig-vijaya.</p>
<p>The citizens were all given facilities for peaceful life, and they were also qualified with appropriate attributes according to varnasrama.</p>
<p>As we have seen from the previous chapter, varnasrama-gunanvitah: the citizens were trained according to the varnasrama system.</p>
<p>A class of men were brahmanas, a class of men were ksatriyas, a class were vaisyas, and a class were sudras.</p>
<p>Without this scientific division, there can be no question of good citizenship.</p>
<p>The King, being magnanimous and perfect in His duty, performed many sacrifices and treated the citizens as His sons, and the citizens, being trained in the varnasrama system, were obedient and perfectly ordered.</p>
<p>The entire monarchy was so opulent and peaceful that the government was even able to sprinkle the street with perfumed water, what to speak of other management.</p>
<p>Since the city was sprinkled with perfumed water, we can simply imagine how opulent it was in other respects.</p>
<p>Why should the citizens not have felt happy during the reign of Lord Ramacandra.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#912" id="912">9.12</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasty of Kusa, the son of Lord Ramacandra.</p>
<p>The members of this dynasty are descendants of Sasada, the son of Maharaja Iksvaku.</p>
<p>Following in the genealogical table of Lord Ramacandra’s dynasty, Kusa, the Lord’s son, was followed consecutively by Atithi, Nisadha, Nabha, Pundarika, Ksemadhanva, Devanika, Aniha, Pariyatra, Balasthala, Vajranabha, Sagana and Vidhrti.</p>
<p>These personalities ruled the world.</p>
<p>From Vidhrti came Hiranyanabha, who later became the disciple of Jaimini and propounded the system of mystic yoga in which Yajnavalkya was initiated.</p>
<p>Following in this dynasty were Puspa, Dhruvasandhi, Sudarsana, Agnivarna, Sighra and Maru.</p>
<p>Maru attained full perfection in the practice of yoga, and he still lives in the village of Kalapa.</p>
<p>At the end of this age of Kali, he will revive the dynasty of the sun-god.</p>
<p>Next in the dynasty were Prasusruta, Sandhi, Amarsana, Mahasvan, Visvabahu, Prasenajit, Taksaka and Brhadbala, who was later killed by Abhimanyu.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said that these were all kings who had passed away.</p>
<p>The future descendants of Brhadbala will be Brhadrana, Urukriya, Vatsavrddha, Prativyoma, Bhanu, Divaka, Sahadeva, Brhadasva, Bhanuman, Pratikasva, Supratika, Marudeva, Sunaksatra, Puskara, Antariksa, Sutapa, Amitrajit, Brhadraja, Barhi, Krtanjaya, Rananjaya, Sanjaya, Sakya, Suddhoda, Langala, Prasenajit, Ksudraka, Ranaka, Suratha and Sumitra.</p>
<p>All of them will become kings one after another.</p>
<p>Sumitra, coming in this age of Kali, will be the last king in the Iksvaku dynasty; after him, the dynasty will be extinguished.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>At least five thousand years ago, Srila Sukadeva Gosvami ascertained the existence of Maru in Kalapa-grama and said that Maru, having achieved a yoga-siddha body, would continue to exist until the end of Kali-yuga, which is calculated to continue for 432,000 years.</p>
<p>Such is the perfection of mystic power.</p>
<p>By controlling the breath, the perfect yogi can continue his life for as long as he likes.</p>
<p>Sometimes we hear from the Vedic literature that some personalities from the Vedic age, such as Vyasadeva and Asvatthama, are still living.</p>
<p>Here we understand that Maru is also still living.</p>
<p>We are sometimes surprised that a mortal body can live for such a long time.</p>
<p>The explanation of this longevity is given here by the word yoga-siddha.</p>
<p>If one becomes perfect in the practice of yoga, he can live as long as he likes.</p>
<p>The demonstration of some trifling yoga-siddha does not constitute perfection.</p>
<p>Here is a factual example of perfection: a yoga-siddha can live as long as he likes.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-11" id="summary-11">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#913" id="913">9.13</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the dynasty in which the great and learned scholar Janaka was born.</p>
<p>This is the dynasty of Maharaja Nimi, who is said to have been the son of Iksvaku.</p>
<p>When Maharaja Nimi began performing great sacrifices, he appointed Vasistha to be chief priest, but Vasistha refused, for he had already agreed to be priest in performing a yajna for Lord Indra.</p>
<p>Vasistha therefore requested Maharaja Nimi to wait until Lord Indra’s sacrifice was finished, but Maharaja Nimi did not wait.</p>
<p>He thought, Life is very short, so there is no need to wait He therefore appointed another priest to perform the yajna.</p>
<p>Vasistha was very angry at King Nimi and cursed him, saying, May your body fall down Cursed in that way, Maharaja Nimi also became very angry, and he retaliated by saying, May your body also fall down As a result of this cursing and countercursing, both of them died.</p>
<p>After this incident, Vasistha took birth again, begotten by Mitra and Varuna, who were agitated by Urvasi.</p>
<p>The priests who were engaged in the sacrifice for King Nimi preserved Nimi’s body in fragrant chemicals.</p>
<p>When the sacrifice was over, the priests prayed for Nimi’s life to all the demigods who had come to the arena of yajna, but Maharaja Nimi refused to take birth again in a material body because he considered the material body obnoxious.</p>
<p>The great sages then churned Nimi’s body, and as a result of this churning, Janaka was born.</p>
<p>The son of Janaka was Udavasu, and the son of Udavasu was Nandivardhana.</p>
<p>The son of Nandivardhana was Suketu, and his descendants continued as follows: Devarata, Brhadratha, Mahavirya, Sudhrti, Dhrstaketu, Haryasva, Maru, Pratipaka, Krtaratha, Devamidha, Visruta, Mahadhrti, Krtirata, Maharoma, Svarnaroma, Hrasvaroma and Siradhvaja.</p>
<p>All these sons appeared in the dynasty one after another.</p>
<p>From Siradhvaja, mother Sitadevi was born.</p>
<p>Siradhvaja’s son was Kusadhvaja, and the son of Kusadhvaja was Dharmadhvaja.</p>
<p>The sons of Dharmadhvaja were Krtadhvaja and Mitadhvaja.</p>
<p>The son of Krtadhvaja was Kesidhvaja, and the son of Mitadhvaja was Khandikya.</p>
<p>Kesidhvaja was a self-realized soul, and his son was Bhanuman, whose descendants were as follows: Satadyumna, Suci, Sanadvaja, Urjaketu, Aja, Purujit, Aristanemi, Srutayu, Suparsvaka, Citraratha, Ksemadhi, Samaratha, Satyaratha, Upaguru, Upagupta, Vasvananta, Yuyudha, Subhasana, Sruta, Jaya, Vijaya, Rta, Sunaka, Vitahavya, Dhrti, Bahulasva, Krti and Mahavasi.</p>
<p>All of these sons were great self-controlled personalities.</p>
<p>This completes the list of the entire dynasty.</p>

<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami said: After beginning sacrifices, Maharaja Nimi, the son of Iksvaku, requested the great sage Vasistha to take the post of chief priest.</p>
<p>At that time, Vasistha replied, My dear Maharaja Nimi, I have already accepted the same post in a sacrifice begun by Lord Indra.</p>

<p>Maharaja Nimi, being a self-realized soul, considered that this life is flickering.</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of waiting long for Vasistha, he began performing the sacrifice with other priests.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Canakya Pandita says, sariram ksana-vidhvamsi kalpanta-sthayino gunah: The duration of one’s life in the material world may end at any moment, but if within this life one does something worthy, that qualification is depicted in history eternally Here is a great personality, Maharaja Nimi, who knew this fact.</p>
<p>In the human form of life one should perform activities in such a way that at the end he goes back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is self-realization.</p>

<p>Therefore I pronounce this curse: your body also will fall</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The religious principle for a brahmana is that he should not be greedy at all.</p>
<p>In this case, however, for the sake of more lucrative remunerations from the King of heaven, Vasistha neglected Maharaja Nimi’s request on this planet, and when Nimi performed the sacrifices with other priests, Vasistha unnecessarily cursed him.</p>
<p>When one is infected by contaminated activities, his power, material or spiritual, reduces.</p>
<p>Although Vasistha was the spiritual master of Maharaja Nimi, because of his greed he became fallen.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After saying this, Maharaja Nimi, who was expert in the science of spiritual knowledge, gave up his body.</p>
<p>Vasistha, the great-grandfather, gave up his body also, but through the semen discharged by Mitra and Varuna when they saw Urvasi, he was born again.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Mitra and Varuna chanced to meet Urvasi, the most beautiful prostitute of the heavenly kingdom, and they became lusty.</p>
<p>Because they were great saints, they tried to control their lust, but they could not do so, and thus they discharged semen.</p>
<p>This semen was kept carefully in a waterpot, and Vasistha was born from it.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>During the performance of the yajna, the body relinquished by Maharaja Nimi was preserved in fragrant substances, and at the end of the Satra-yaga the great saints and brahmanas made the following request to all the demigods assembled there.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#9138" id="9138">9.13.8</a></h3>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with this sacrifice and if you are actually able to do so, kindly bring Maharaja Nimi back to life in this body The demigods said yes to this request by the sages, but Maharaja Nimi said, Please do not imprison me again in a material body</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods are in a position many times higher than that of human beings.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the great saints and sages were also powerful brahmanas, they requested the demigods to revive Maharaja Nimi’s body, which had been preserved in various perfumed balms.</p>
<p>One should not think that the demigods are powerful only in enjoying the senses; they are also powerful in such deeds as bringing life back to a dead body.</p>
<p>There are many similar instances in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>For example, according to the history of Savitri and Satyavan, Satyavan died and was being taken away by Yamaraja, but on the request of his wife, Savitri, Satyavan was revived in the same body.</p>
<p>This is an important fact about the power of the demigods.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Nimi continued: Mayavadis generally want freedom from accepting a material body because they fear having to give it up again.</p>
<p>But devotees whose intelligence is always filled with the service of the Lord are unafraid.</p>
<p>Indeed, they take advantage of the body to render transcendental loving service.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Nimi did not want to accept a material body, which would be a cause of bondage; because he was a devotee, he wanted a body by which he could render devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings:</p>
<p>janmaobi more iccha yadi tora</p>
<p>bhakta-grhe jani janma ha-u mora</p>
<p>kita-janma ha-u yatha tuya dasa</p>
<p>My Lord, if You want me to take birth and accept a material body again, kindly do me this favor: allow me to take birth in the home of Your servant, Your devotee.</p>
<p>I do not mind being born there even as an insignificant creature like an insect Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu also said:</p>
<p>na dhanam na janam na sundarim</p>
<p>kavitam va jagadisa kamaye</p>
<p>mama janmani janmanisvare</p>
<p>bhavatad bhaktir ahaitukyi tvayi</p>
<p>O Lord of the universe, I do not desire material wealth, materialistic followers, a beautiful wife or fruitive activities described in flowery language.</p>
<p>All I want, life after life, is unmotivated devotional service to You (Siksastaka4) By saying life after lif (janmani janmani), the Lord referred not to an ordinary birth but a birth in which to remember the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Such a body is desirable.</p>
<p>A devotee does not think like yogis and jnanis, who want to refuse a material body and become one with the impersonal Brahman effulgence.</p>
<p>A devotee does not like this idea.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he will accept any body, material or spiritual, for he wants to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>This is real liberation.</p>
<p>If one has a strong desire to serve the Lord, even if he accepts a material body, there is no cause of anxiety, since a devotee, even in a material body, is a liberated soul.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Srila Rupa Gosvami:</p>
<p>iha yasya harer dasye</p>
<p>karmana manasa gira</p>
<p>nikhilasv apy avasthasu</p>
<p>jivan-muktah sa ucyate</p>
<p>A person acting in Krsna consciousness (or, in other words, in the service of Krsna) with his body, mind, intelligence and words is a liberated person even within the material world, although he may be engaged in many so-called material activities The desire to serve the Lord establishes one as liberated in any condition of life, whether in a spiritual body or a material body.</p>
<p>In a spiritual body the devotee becomes a direct associate of the Lord, but even though a devotee may superficially appear to be in a material body, he is always liberated and is engaged in the same duties of service to the Lord as a devotee in Vaikunthaloka.</p>
<p>There is no distinction.</p>
<p>It is said, sadhur jivo va maro va.</p>
<p>Whether a devotee is alive or dead, his only concern is to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti (Bg.4.9).</p>
<p>When he gives up his body, he goes directly to become an associate of the Lord and serve Him, although he does the same thing even in a material body in the material world.</p>
<p>For a devotee there is no pain, pleasure or material perfection.</p>
<p>One may argue that at the time of death a devotee also suffers because of giving up his material body.</p>
<p>But in this connection the example may be given that a cat carries a mouse in its mouth and also carries a kitten in its mouth.</p>
<p>Both the mouse and the kitten are carried in the same mouth, but the perception of the mouse is different from that of the kitten.</p>
<p>When a devotee gives up his body (tyaktva deham), he is ready to go back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus his perception is certainly different from that of a person being taken away by Yamaraja for punishment.</p>
<p>A person whose intelligence is always concentrated upon the service of the Lord is unafraid of accepting a material body, whereas a nondevotee, having no engagement in the service of the Lord, is very much afraid of accepting a material body or giving up his present one.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should follow the instruction of Caitanya Mahaprabhu: mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether we accept a material body or a spiritual body; our only ambition should be to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>deham—a material body; na—not; avarurutse—desire to accept; aham—I; duhkha-soka-bhaya-avaham—which is the cause of all kinds of distress, lamentation and fear; sarvatra—always and everywhere within this universe; asya—of the living entities who have accepted material bodies; yatah—because; mrtyuh—death; matsyanam—of the fish; udake—living within the water; yatha—like.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I do not wish to accept a material body, for such a body is the source of all distress, lamentation and fear, everywhere in the universe, just as it is for a fish in the water, which lives always in anxiety because of fear of death.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The material body, whether in the higher or lower planetary system, is destined to die.</p>
<p>In the lower planetary system or lower species of life one may die soon, and in the higher planets or higher species one may live for a long, long time, but death is inevitable.</p>
<p>This fact should be understood.</p>
<p>In the human form of life one should take the opportunity to put an end to birth, death, old age and disease by performing tapasya.</p>
<p>This is the aim of human civilization: to stop the repetition of birth and death, which is called mrtyu-samsara-vartmani.</p>
<p>This can be done only when one is Krsna conscious, or has achieved the service of the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Otherwise one must rot in this material world and accept a material body subject to birth, death, old age and disease.</p>
<p>The example given here is that water is a very nice place for a fish, but the fish is never free from anxiety about death, since big fish are always eager to eat the small fish phalguni tatra mahatam: all living entities are eaten by bigger living entities.</p>
<p>This is the way of material nature ahastani sahastanam</p>
<p>apadani catus-padam</p>
<p>phalguni tatra mahatam</p>
<p>jivo jivasya jivanam</p>
<p>Those who are devoid of hands are prey for those who have hands; those devoid of legs are prey for the four-legged.</p>
<p>The weak are the subsistence of the strong, and the general rule holds that one living being is food for another (Bhag.1.13.47) The Supreme Personality of Godhead has created the material world in such a way that one living entity is food for another.</p>
<p>Thus there is a struggle for existence, but although we speak of survival of the fittest, no one can escape death without becoming a devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>Harim vina naiva srtim taranti: one cannot escape the cycle of birth and death without becoming a devotee.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.3).</p>
<p>Aprapya mam nivartante mrtyu-samsara-vartmani.</p>
<p>One who does not attain shelter at the lotus feet of Krsna must certainly wander up and down within the cycle of birth and death.</p>

<p>devah ucuh—the demigods said; videhah—without any material body; usyatam—you live; kamam—as you like; locanesu—in the vision; saririnam—of those who have material bodies; unmesana-nimesabhyam—become manifest and unmanifest as you desire; laksitah—being seen; adhyatma-samsthitah—situated in a spiritual body.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The demigods said: Let Maharaja Nimi live without a material body.</p>
<p>Let him live in a spiritual body as a personal associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and, according to his desire, let him be manifest or unmanifest to common materially embodied people.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The demigods wanted Maharaja Nimi to come to life, but Maharaja Nimi did not want to accept another material body.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, the demigods, having been requested by the saintly persons, gave him the benediction that he would be able to stay in his spiritual body.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of spiritual bodies, as generally understood by common men.</p>
<p>The term spiritual bod is sometimes taken to refer to a ghostly body.</p>
<p>An impious man who dies after sinful activities is sometimes condemned so that he cannot possess a gross material body of five material elements, but must live in a subtle body of mind, intelligence and ego.</p>
<p>However, as explained in Bhagavad-gita, devotees can give up the material body and attain a spiritual body free from all material tinges, gross and subtle (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so ’rjuna (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>Thus the demigods gave King Nimi the benediction that he would be able to stay in a purely spiritual body, free from all gross and subtle material contamination.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be seen or unseen according to His own transcendental desire; similarly, a devotee, being jivan-mukta, can be seen or not, as he chooses.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, naham prakasah sarvasya yogamaya-samavrtah: (Bg.7.25) the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is not manifest to everyone and anyone.</p>
<p>To the common man He is unseen.</p>
<p>Atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih: (BRS.1.2.234) Krsna and His name, fame, qualities and paraphernalia cannot be materially understood.</p>
<p>Unless one is advanced in spiritual life (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau), one cannot see Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore the ability to see Krsna depends on Krsna’s mercy.</p>
<p>The same privilege of being seen or unseen according to one’s own desire was given to Maharaja Nimi.</p>
<p>Thus he lived in his original, spiritual body as an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, to save the people from the danger of an unregulated government, the sages churned Maharaja Nimi’s material body, from which, as a result, a son was born.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Arajaka-bhayam.</p>
<p>If the government is unsteady and unregulated, there is danger of fear for the people.</p>
<p>At the present moment this danger always exists because of government by the people.</p>
<p>Here we can see that the great sages got a son from Nimi’s material body to guide the citizens properly, for such guidance is the duty of a ksatriya king.</p>
<p>A ksatriya is one who saves the citizens from being injured.</p>
<p>In the so-called people’s government there is no trained ksatriya king; as soon as someone strong accumulates votes, he becomes the minister or president, without training from the learned brahmanas expert in the sastras.</p>
<p>Indeed, we see that in some countries the government changes from party to party, and therefore the men in charge of the government are more eager to protect their position than to see that the citizens are happy.</p>
<p>The Vedic civilization prefers monarchy.</p>
<p>People liked the government of Lord Ramacandra, the government of Maharaja Yudhisthira and the governments of Maharaja Pariksit, Maharaja Ambarisa and Maharaja Prahlada.</p>
<p>There are many instances of excellent government under a monarch.</p>
<p>Gradually the democratic government is becoming unfit for the needs of the people, and therefore some parties are trying to elect a dictator.</p>
<p>A dictatorship is the same as a monarchy, but without a trained leader.</p>
<p>Actually people will be happy when a trained leader, whether a monarch or a dictator, takes control of the government and rules the people according to the standard regulations of the authorized scriptures.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: My dear King Pariksit, all the kings of the dynasty of Mithila were completely in knowledge of their spiritual identity.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though staying at home, they were liberated from the duality of material existence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This material world is called dvaita, or duality.</p>
<p>The Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya4.176) says:</p>
<p>’dvaite ’bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba——’manodharma’</p>
<p>’ei bhala, ei manda,’——ei saba ’bhrama’ In the world of duality—that is to say, in the material world—so-called goodness and badness are both the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this world, to distinguish between good and bad, happiness and distress, is meaningless because they are both mental concoctions (manodharma).</p>
<p>Because everything here is miserable and troublesome, to create an artificial situation and pretend it to be full of happiness is simply illusion.</p>
<p>The liberated person, being above the influence of the three modes of material nature, is unaffected by such dualities in all circumstances.</p>
<p>He remains Krsna conscious by tolerating so-called happiness and distress.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):</p>
<p>matra-sparsas tu kaunteya</p>
<p>sitosna-sukha-duhkhadah</p>
<p>agamapayino ’nityas</p>
<p>tams titiksasva bharata</p>
<p>O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.</p>
<p>They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed Those who are liberated, being on the transcendental platform of rendering service to the Lord, do not care about so-called happiness and distress.</p>
<p>They know that these are like changing seasons, which are perceivable by contact with the material body.</p>
<p>Happiness and distress come and go.</p>
<p>Therefore a pandita, a learned man, is not concerned with them.</p>
<p>As it is said, gatasun agatasums ca nanusocanti panditah.</p>
<p>The body is dead from the very beginning because it is a lump of matter.</p>
<p>It has no feelings of happiness and distress.</p>
<p>Because the soul within the body is in the bodily concept of life, he suffers happiness and distress, but these come and go.</p>
<p>It is understood herewith that the kings born in the dynasty of Mithila were all liberated persons, unaffected by the so-called happiness and distress of this world.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-12" id="summary-12">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#914-1" id="914-1">9.14</a></h3>
<p>The summary of this Fourteenth Chapter is given as follows.</p>
<p>This chapter describes Soma and how he kidnapped the wife of Brhaspati and begot in her womb a son named Budha.</p>
<p>Budha begot Pururava, who begot six sons, headed by Ayu, in the womb of Urvasi.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma was born from the lotus that sprouted from the navel of Garbhodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Brahma had a son named Atri, and Atri’s son was Soma, the king of all drugs and stars.</p>
<p>Soma became the conqueror of the entire universe, and, being inflated with pride, he kidnapped Tara, who was the wife of Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods.</p>
<p>A great fight ensued between the demigods and the asuras, but Brahma rescued Brhaspati’s wife from the clutches of Soma and returned her to her husband, thus stopping the fighting.</p>
<p>In the womb of Tara, Soma begot a son named Budha, who later begot in the womb of Ila a son named Aila, or Pururava.</p>
<p>Urvasi was captivated by Pururava’s beauty, and therefore she lived with him for some time, but when she left his company he became almost like a madman.</p>
<p>While traveling all over the world, he met Urvasi again at Kuruksetra, but she agreed to join with him for only one night in a year.</p>
<p>One year later, Pururava saw Urvasi at Kuruksetra and was glad to be with her for one night, but when he thought of her leaving him again, he was overwhelmed by grief.</p>
<p>Urvasi then advised Pururava to worship the Gandharvas.</p>
<p>Being satisfied with Pururava, the Gandharvas gave him a woman known as Agnisthali.</p>
<p>Pururava mistook Agnisthali for Urvasi, but while he was wandering in the forest his misunderstanding was cleared, and he immediately gave up her company.</p>
<p>After returning home and meditating upon Urvasi all night, he wanted to perform a Vedic ritualistic ceremony to satisfy his desire.</p>
<p>Thereafter he went to the same place where he had left Agnisthali, and there he saw that from the womb of a sami tree had come an asvattha tree.</p>
<p>Pururava made two sticks from this tree and thus produced a fire.</p>
<p>By such a fire one can satisfy all lusty desires.</p>
<p>The fire was considered the son of Pururava.</p>
<p>In Satya-yuga there was only one social division, called hamsa; there were no divisions of varna like brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra.</p>
<p>The Veda was the omkara.</p>
<p>The various demigods were not worshiped, for only the Supreme Personality of Godhead was the worshipable Deity.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>From Atri’s tears of jubilation was born a son named Soma, the moon, who was full of soothing rays.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma appointed him the director of the brahmanas, drugs and luminaries.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic description, Soma, the moon-god, was born from the mind of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (candrama manaso jatah).</p>
<p>But here we find that Soma was born from the tears in the eyes of Atri.</p>
<p>This appears contradictory to the Vedic information, but actually it is not, for this birth of the moon is understood to have taken place in another millennium.</p>
<p>When tears appear in the eyes because of jubilation, the tears are soothing.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.1.15) we find this verse:</p>
<p>atreh patny anasuya trin</p>
<p>jajne suyasasah sutan</p>
<p>dattam durvasasam somam</p>
<p>atmesa-brahma-sambhavan</p>
<p>This verse describes that Anasuya, the wife of Atri Rsi, bore three sons—Soma, Durvasa and Dattatreya.</p>
<p>It is said that at the time of conception Anasuya was impregnated by the tears of Atri.</p>

<p>After conquering the three worlds (the upper, middle and lower planetary systems), Soma, the moon-god, performed a great sacrifice known as the Rajasuya-yajna.</p>

<p>Sukra, being an enemy of Brhaspati, also joined the moon-god to retaliate in wrath against Brhaspati.</p>
<p>To counteract this situation, Lord Siva, who was affectionate toward Brhaspati, joined Brhaspati.</p>
<p>The father of Brhaspati was Angira, from whom Lord Siva had received knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore Lord Siva had some affection for Brhaspati and joined his side in this fight.</p>

<p>Tara was married to Brhaspati, and therefore as a chaste woman she should have been impregnated by him.</p>
<p>But instead she preferred to be impregnated by Soma, the moon-god, and therefore she was unchaste.</p>
<p>Although Brhaspati accepted Tara from Brahma, when he saw that she was pregnant he wanted her to deliver a son immediately.</p>
<p>Tara certainly very much feared her husband, and she thought she might be punished after giving birth.</p>
<p>Thus Brhaspati assured her that he would not punish her, for although she was unchaste and had become pregnant illicitly, she wanted a son.</p>

<p>Indeed, you are attractive to all human society.</p>
<p>Therefore, since you have come of your own accord from the heavenly planets, who on earth would not agree to serve a demigoddess such as you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears from the words of Urvasi that the standard of living, eating, behavior and speech are all different on the heavenly planets from the standards on this planet earth.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the heavenly planets do not eat such abominable things as meat and eggs; everything they eat is prepared in clarified butter.</p>
<p>Nor do they like to see either men or women naked, except at the time of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>To live naked or almost naked is uncivilized, but on this planet earth it has now become fashionable to dress half naked, and sometimes those like hippies live completely naked.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many clubs and societies for this purpose.</p>
<p>Such conduct is not allowed, however, on the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the heavenly planets, aside from being very beautiful, both in complexion and bodily features, are well behaved and long-living, and they eat first-class food in goodness.</p>

<p>Women have been compared to sudras and vaisyas (striyo vaisyas tatha sudrah).</p>
<p>On the spiritual platform, however, when one is elevated to the platform of Krsna consciousness, whether one is a man, woman, sudra or whatever, everyone is equal.</p>

<p>If a man cannot control his senses, he becomes a victim of such sly foxes.</p>
<p>But if one can control the senses, there is no chance of his being victimized by sly, foxlike women.</p>

<p>Women as a class are merciless and cunning.</p>
<p>They cannot tolerate even a slight offense.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>King Pururava was greatly attached to Urvasi.</p>
<p>Yet despite his faithfulness to her, she had left him.</p>
<p>Now, considering that the King was wasting his rarely achieved human form of life, Urvasi frankly explained the nature of a woman.</p>
<p>Because of her nature, a woman can respond to even a slight offense from her husband by not only leaving him but even killing him if required.</p>
<p>To say nothing of her husband, she can even kill her brother.</p>
<p>That is a woman’s nature.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the material world, unless women are trained to be chaste and faithful to their husbands, there cannot be peace or prosperity in society.</p>

<p>If women are given freedom to mingle with men like equals, which they now claim to be, they cannot keep their propriety.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Urvasi said: My dear King, seek shelter of the Gandharvas, for they will be able to deliver me to you again In accordance with these words, the King satisfied the Gandharvas by prayers, and the Gandharvas, being pleased with him, gave him an Agnisthali girl who looked exactly like Urvasi.</p>
<p>Thinking that the girl was Urvasi, the King began walking with her in the forest, but later he could understand that she was not Urvasi but Agnisthali.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that Pururava was very lusty.</p>
<p>Immediately after getting the Agnisthali girl, he wanted to have sex with her, but during sexual intercourse he could understand that the girl was Agnisthali, not Urvasi.</p>
<p>This indicates that every man attached to a particular woman knows the particular characteristics of that woman during sex life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Pururava then left Agnisthali in the forest and returned home, where he meditated all night upon Urvasi.</p>
<p>In the course of his meditation, the Treta millennium began, and therefore the principles of the three Vedas, including the process of performing yajna to fulfill fruitive activities, appeared within his heart.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, tretayam yajato makhaih: in Treta-yuga, if one performed yajnas, he would get the results of those yajnas.</p>
<p>By performing visnu-yajna specifically, one could even achieve the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Of course, yajna is intended to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>While Pururava was meditating upon Urvasi, the Treta-yuga began, and therefore the Vedic yajnas were revealed in his heart.</p>
<p>But Pururava was a materialistic man, especially interested in enjoying the senses.</p>
<p>Yajnas for enjoyment of the senses are called karma-kandiya-yajnas.</p>
<p>Therefore, he decided to perform karma-kandiya-yajnas to fulfill his lusty desires.</p>
<p>In other words, karma-kandiya-yajnas are meant for sensuous persons, whereas yajna should actually be performed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>To please the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga, the sankirtana-yajna is recommended.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah (SB 11.5.32).</p>
<p>Only those who are very intelligent take to sankirtana-yajna to fulfill all their desires, material and spiritual, whereas those who are lusty for sense enjoyment perform karma-kandiya-yajnas.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the process of fruitive yajna became manifest within his heart, King Pururava went to the same spot where he had left Agnisthali.</p>
<p>There he saw that from the womb of a sami tree, an asvattha tree had grown.</p>
<p>He then took a piece of wood from that tree and made it into two aranis.</p>
<p>Desiring to go to the planet where Urvasi resided, he chanted mantras, meditating upon the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the piece of wood between them as his son.</p>
<p>In this way he began to ignite a fire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Vedic fire for performing yajna was not ignited with ordinary matches or similar devices.</p>
<p>Rather, the Vedic sacrificial fire was ignited by the aranis, or two sacred pieces of wood, which produced fire by friction with a third.</p>
<p>Such a fire is necessary for the performance of yajna.</p>
<p>If successful, a yajna will fulfill the desire of its performer.</p>
<p>Thus Pururava took advantage of the process of yajna to fulfill his lusty desires.</p>
<p>He thought of the lower arani as Urvasi, the upper one as himself, and the middle one as his son.</p>
<p>A relevant Vedic mantra quoted herein by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura is sami-garbhad agnim mantha.</p>
<p>A similar mantra is urvasyam urasi pururavah.</p>
<p>Pururava wanted to have children continuously by the womb of Urvasi.</p>
<p>His only ambition was to have sex life with Urvasi and thereby get a son.</p>
<p>In other words, he had so much lust in his heart that even while performing yajna he thought of Urvasi, instead of thinking of the master of yajna, Yajnesvara, Lord Visnu.</p>

<p>Thus the fire was considered the son of King Pururava.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic process, one can get a son through semen (sukra), one can get a bona fide disciple through initiation (savitra), or one can get a son or disciple through the fire of sacrifice (yajna).</p>
<p>Thus when Maharaja Pururava generated the fire by rubbing the aranis, the fire became his son.</p>
<p>Either by semen, by initiation or by yajna one may get a son.</p>
<p>The Vedic mantra omkara, or pranava, consisting of the letters a-u-m, can call each of these three methods into existence.</p>
<p>Therefore the words nirmanthanaj jatah indicate that by the rubbing of the aranis a son was born.</p>

<p>bhagavantam adhoksajam</p>
<p>urvasi-lokam anvicchan</p>
<p>sarva-devamayam harim</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tena—by generating such a fire; ayajata—he worshiped; yajna-isam—the master or enjoyer of the yajna; bhagavantam—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; adhoksajam—beyond the perception of the senses; urvasi-lokam—to the planet where Urvasi was staying; anvicchan—although desiring to go; sarva-deva-mayam—the reservoir of all demigods; harim—the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By means of that fire, Pururava, who desired to go to the planet where Urvasi resided, performed a sacrifice, by which he satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hari, the enjoyer of the results of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Thus he worshiped the Lord, who is beyond the perception of the senses and is the reservoir of all the demigods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram: (Bg.5.29) any loka, or planet, to which one wants to go is the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of the performance of sacrifice.</p>
<p>The purpose of yajna is to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In this age, as we have explained many times, the yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is the only sacrifice that can satisfy the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>When the Lord is satisfied, one can fulfill any desire, material or spiritual.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita (3.14) also says, yajnad bhavati parjanyah: by offering sacrifices to Lord Visnu, one can have sufficient rainfall.</p>
<p>When there is sufficient rainfall, the earth becomes fit to produce everything (sama-kama-dugha mahi).</p>
<p>If one can utilize the land properly, one can get all the necessities of life from the land, including food grains, fruits, flowers and vegetables.</p>
<p>Everything one gets for material wealth is produced from the earth, and therefore it is said, sarva-kama-dugha mahi (Bhag.1.10.4).</p>
<p>Everything is possible by performing yajna.</p>
<p>Therefore although Pururava desired something material, he factually performed yajna to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Lord is adhoksaja, beyond the perception of Pururava and everyone else.</p>
<p>Consequently, some kind of yajna must be performed to fulfill the desires of the living entity.</p>
<p>Yajnas can be performed in human society only when society is divided by varnasrama-dharma into four varnas and four asramas.</p>
<p>Without such a regulative process, no one can perform yajnas, and without the performance of yajnas, no material plans can make human society happy at any time.</p>
<p>Everyone should therefore be induced to perform yajnas.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, the yajna recommended is sankirtana, the individual or collective chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>This will bring the fulfillment of all necessities for human society.</p>

<p>eka eva pura vedah</p>
<p>pranavah sarva-vanmayah</p>
<p>devo narayano nanya</p>
<p>eko ’gnir varna eva ca</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ekah—only one; eva—indeed; pura—formerly; vedah—book of transcendental knowledge; pranavah—omkara; sarva-vak-mayah—consisting of all Vedic mantras; devah—the Lord, God; narayanah—only Narayana (was worshipable in the Satya-yuga); na anyah—no other; ekah agnih—one division only for agni; varnah—order of life; eva ca—and certainly.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the Satya-yuga, the first millennium, all the Vedic mantras were included in one mantra—pranava, the root of all Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>In other words, the Atharva Veda alone was the source of all Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead Narayana was the only worshipable Deity; there was no recommendation for worship of the demigods.</p>
<p>Fire was one only, and the only order of life in human society was known as hamsa.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Satya-yuga there was only one Veda, not four.</p>
<p>Later, before the beginning of Kali-yuga, this one Veda, the Atharva Veda (or, some say, the Yajur Veda), was divided into four—Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva—for the facility of human society.</p>
<p>In Satya-yuga the only mantra was omkara (om tat sat).</p>
<p>The same name omkara is manifest in the mantra Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>Unless one is a brahmana, one cannot utter omkara and get the desired result.</p>
<p>But in Kali-yuga almost everyone is a sudra, unfit for pronouncing the pranava, omkara.</p>
<p>Therefore the sastras have recommended the chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>Omkara is a mantra, or maha-mantra, and Hare Krsna is also a maha-mantra.</p>
<p>The purpose of pronouncing omkara is to address the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva (om namo bhagavate vasudevaya).</p>
<p>And the purpose of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra is the same.</p>
<p>Hare: O energy of the Lord Krsna: O Lord Krsna Hare: O energy of the Lord Rama: O Supreme Lord, O supreme enjoyer The only worshipable Lord is Hari, who is the goal of the Vedas (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>By worshiping the demigods, one worships the different parts of the Lord, just as one might water the branches and twigs of a tree.</p>
<p>But worshiping Narayana, the all-inclusive Supreme Personality of Godhead, is like pouring water on the root of the tree, thus supplying water to the trunk, branches, twigs, leaves and so on.</p>
<p>In Satya-yuga people knew how to fulfill the necessities of life simply by worshiping Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The same purpose can be served in this age of Kali by the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, as recommended in the Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Kirtanad eva krsnasya mukta-sangah param vrajet.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, one becomes free from the bondage of material existence and thus becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>pururavasah—from King Pururava; eva—thus; asit—there was; trayi—the Vedic principles of karma, jnana and upasana; treta-mukhe—in the beginning of the Treta-yuga; nrpa—O King Pariksit; agnina—simply by generating the fire of sacrifice; prajaya—by his son; raja—King Pururava; lokam—to the planet; gandharvam—of the Gandharvas; eyivan—achieved.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Maharaja Pariksit, at the beginning of Treta-yuga, King Pururava inaugurated a karma-kanda sacrifice.</p>
<p>Thus Pururava, who considered the yajnic fire his son, was able to go to Gandharvaloka as he desired.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Satya-yuga, Lord Narayana was worshiped by meditation (krte yad dhyayato visnum).</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone always meditated upon Lord Visnu, Narayana, and achieved every success by this process of meditation.</p>
<p>In the next yuga, Treta-yuga, the performance of yajna began (tretayam yajato mukhaih).</p>
<p>Therefore this verse says, trayi treta-mukhe.</p>
<p>Ritualistic ceremonies are generally called fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that in Treta-yuga, beginning in the Svayambhuva-manvantara, ritualistic fruitive activities were similarly manifested from Priyavrata, etc.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#915-1" id="915-1">9.15</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the history of Gadhi in the dynasty of Aila.</p>
<p>From the womb of Urvasi came six sons, named Ayu, Srutayu, Satyayu, Raya, Jaya and Vijaya.</p>
<p>The son of Srutayu was Vasuman, the son of Satyayu was Srutanjaya, the son of Raya was Eka, the son of Jaya was Amita, and the son of Vijaya was Bhima.</p>
<p>Bhima’s son was named Kancana, the son of Kancana was Hotraka, and the son of Hotraka was Jahnu, who was celebrated for having drunk all the water of the Ganges in one sip.</p>
<p>The descendants of Jahnu, one after another, were Puru, Balaka, Ajaka and Kusa.</p>
<p>The sons of Kusa were Kusambu, Tanaya, Vasu and Kusanabha.</p>
<p>From Kusambu came Gadhi, who had a daughter named Satyavati.</p>
<p>Satyavati married Rcika Muni after the muni contributed a substantial dowry, and from the womb of Satyavati by Rcika Muni, Jamadagni was born.</p>
<p>The son of Jamadagni was Rama, or Parasurama.</p>
<p>When a king named Kartaviryarjuna stole Jamadagni’s desire cow, Parasurama, who is ascertained by learned experts to be a saktyavesa incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kartaviryarjuna.</p>
<p>Later, he annihilated the ksatriya dynasty twenty-one times.</p>
<p>After Parasurama killed Kartaviryarjuna, Jamadagni told him that killing a king is sinful and that as a brahmana he should have tolerated the offense.</p>
<p>Therefore Jamadagni advised Parasurama to atone for his sin by traveling to various holy places.</p>

<p>King Gadhi had a daughter named Satyavati, whom a brahmana sage named Rcika requested from the King to be his wife.</p>
<p>King Gadhi, however, regarded Rcika as an unfit husband for his daughter, and therefore he told the brahmana, My dear sir, I belong to the dynasty of Kusa.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the great sage Rcika returned home after bathing and understood what had happened in his absence, he said to his wife, Satyavati, You have done a great wrong.</p>
<p>Your son will be a fierce ksatriya, able to punish everyone, and your brother will be a learned scholar in spiritual science</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A brahmana is highly qualified when he can control his senses and mind, when he is a learned scholar in spiritual science and when he is tolerant and forgiving.</p>
<p>A ksatriya, however, is highly qualified when he is fierce in giving punishment to wrongdoers.</p>
<p>These qualities are stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.42–43).</p>
<p>Because Satyavati, instead of eating her own oblation, had eaten that which was meant for her mother, she would give birth to a son imbued with the ksatriya spirit.</p>
<p>This was undesirable.</p>
<p>The son of a brahmana is generally expected to become a brahmana, but if such a son becomes fierce like a ksatriya, he is designated according to the description of the four varnas in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>If the son of a brahmana does not become like a brahmana, he may be called a ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, according to his qualifications.</p>
<p>The basic principle for dividing society is not a person’s birth but his qualities and actions.</p>

<p>drptam—very proud; ksatram—the ksatriyas, the ruling class; bhuvah—of the earth; bharam—burden; abrahmanyam—sinful, not caring for the religious principles enunciated by the brahmanas; aninasat—drove away or annihilated; rajah-tamah—by the qualities of passion and ignorance; vrtam—covered; ahan—he killed; phalguni—not very great; api—although; krte—had been committed; amhasi—an offense.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the royal dynasty, being excessively proud because of the material modes of passion and ignorance, became irreligious and ceased to care for the laws enacted by the brahmanas, Parasurama killed them.</p>
<p>Although their offense was not very severe, he killed them to lessen the burden of the world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The ksatriyas, or the ruling class, must govern the world in accordance with the rules and regulations enacted by great brahmanas and saintly persons.</p>
<p>As soon as the ruling class becomes irresponsible in regard to the religious principles, it becomes a burden on the earth.</p>
<p>As stated here, rajas-tamo-vrtam, bharam abrahmanyam: when the ruling class is influenced by the lower modes of nature, namely ignorance and passion, it becomes a burden to the world and must then be annihilated by superior power.</p>
<p>We actually see from modern history that monarchies have been abolished by various revolutions, but unfortunately the monarchies have been abolished to establish the supremacy of third-class and fourth-class men.</p>
<p>Although monarchies overpowered by the modes of passion and ignorance have been abolished in the world, the inhabitants of the world are still unhappy, for although the qualities of the former monarchs were degraded by taints of ignorance, these monarchs have been replaced by men of the mercantile and worker classes whose qualities are even more degraded.</p>
<p>When the government is actually guided by brahmanas, or God conscious men, then there can be real happiness for the people.</p>
<p>Therefore in previous times, when the ruling class was degraded to the modes of passion and ignorance, the brahmanas, headed by such a ksatriya-spirited brahmana as Parasurama, killed them twenty-one consecutive times.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.13), dasyu-prayesu rajasu: the ruling class (rajanya) will be no better than plunderers (dasyus) because the third-class and fourth-class men will monopolize the affairs of the government.</p>
<p>Ignoring the religious principles and brahminical rules and regulations, they will certainly try to plunder the riches of the citizens without consideration.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.1.40):</p>
<p>asamskrtah kriya-hina</p>
<p>rajasa tamasavrtah</p>
<p>prajas te bhaksayisyanti</p>
<p>mleccha rajanya-rupinah</p>
<p>Being unpurified, neglecting to discharge human duties properly, and being influenced by the modes of passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas), unclean people (mlecchas), posing as members of the government (rajanya-rupinah), will swallow the citizens (prajas te bhaksayisyanti).</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.7–8) says:</p>
<p>evam prajabhir dustabhir</p>
<p>akirne ksiti-mandale</p>
<p>brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam</p>
<p>yo bali bhavita nrpah</p>
<p>praja hi lubdhai rajanyair</p>
<p>nirghrnair dasyu-dharmabhih</p>
<p>acchinna-dara-dravina</p>
<p>yasyanti giri-kananam</p>
<p>Human society is naturally grouped into four divisions, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>But if this system is neglected and the qualities and divisions of society are not considered, the result will be brahma-vit-ksatra-sudranam yo bali bhavita nrpah: the so-called caste system of brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra will be meaningless.</p>
<p>As a result, whoever somehow or other becomes powerful will be the king or president, and thus the prajas, or citizens, will be so harassed that they will give up hearth and home and will go to the forest (yasyanti giri-kananam) to escape harassment by government officials who have no mercy and are addicted to the ways of plunderers.</p>
<p>Therefore the prajas, or the people in general, must take to the Krsna consciousness movement, the Hare Krsna movement, which is the sound incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Kali-kale nama-rupe krsna-avatara: Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has now appeared as an incarnation by His holy name.</p>
<p>Therefore, when the prajas become Krsna conscious, they can then expect a good government and good society, a perfect life, and liberation from the bondage of material existence.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The sage Jamadagni, who was engaged in great austerities in the forest, received the King very well, along with the King’s soldiers, ministers and carriers.</p>
<p>He supplied all the necessities to worship these guests, for he possessed a kamadhenu cow that was able to supply everything.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Brahma-samhita informs us that the spiritual world, and especially the planet Goloka Vrndavana, where Krsna lives, is full of surabhi cows (surabhir abhipalayantam (Bs.5.29)).</p>
<p>The surabhi cow is also called kamadhenu.</p>
<p>Although Jamadagni possessed only one kamadhenu, he was able to get from it everything desirable.</p>
<p>Thus he was able to receive the King, along with the King’s great number of followers, ministers, soldiers, animals and palanquin carriers.</p>
<p>When we speak of a king, we understand that he is accompanied by many followers.</p>
<p>Jamadagni was able to receive all the King’s followers properly and feed them sumptuously with food prepared in ghee.</p>
<p>The King was astonished at how opulent Jamadagni was because of possessing only one cow, and therefore he became envious of the great sage.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of his offense.</p>
<p>Parasurama, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, killed Kartaviryarjuna because Kartaviryarjuna was too proud.</p>
<p>One may possess unusual opulence in this material world, but if one becomes puffed up and acts whimsically he will be punished by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the lesson to learn from this history, in which Parasurama became angry at Kartaviryarjuna and killed him and rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kartaviryarjuna thought that Jamadagni was more powerful and wealthy than himself because of possessing a jewel in the form of the kamadhenu.</p>
<p>Therefore he and his own men, the Haihayas, were not very much appreciative of Jamadagni’s reception.</p>
<p>On the contrary, they wanted to possess that kamadhenu, which was useful for the execution of the agnihotra sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Jamadagni was more powerful than Kartaviryarjuna because of performing the agnihotra-yajna with clarified butter received from the kamadhenu.</p>
<p>Not everyone can be expected to possess such a cow.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, an ordinary man may possess an ordinary cow, give protection to this animal, take sufficient milk from it, and engage the milk to produce butter and clarified ghee, especially for performing the agnihotra-yajna.</p>
<p>This is possible for everyone.</p>
<p>Thus we find that in Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna advises go-raksya, the protection of cows.</p>
<p>This is essential because if cows are cared for properly they will surely supply sufficient milk.</p>
<p>We have practical experience in America that in our various ISKCON farms we are giving proper protection to the cows and receiving more than enough milk.</p>
<p>In other farms the cows do not deliver as much milk as in our farms; because our cows know very well that we are not going to kill them, they are happy, and they give ample milk.</p>
<p>Therefore this instruction given by Lord Krsna—go-raksya—is extremely meaningful.</p>
<p>The whole world must learn from Krsna how to live happily without scarcity simply by producing food grains (annad bhavanti bhutani) and giving protection to the cows (go-raksya).</p>
<p>Krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhavajam (Bg.18.44).</p>
<p>Those who belong to the third level of human society, namely the mercantile people, must keep land for producing food grains and giving protection to cows.</p>
<p>This is the injunction of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>In the matter of protecting the cows, the meat-eaters will protest, but in answer to them we may say that since Krsna gives stress to cow protection, those who are inclined to eat meat may eat the flesh of unimportant animals like hogs, dogs, goats and sheep, but they should not touch the life of the cows, for this is destructive to the spiritual advancement of human society.</p>

<p>Thus the men forcibly took away the crying kamadhenu, along with her calf, to Mahismati, Kartaviryarjuna’s capital.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word havirdhanim is significant in this verse.</p>
<p>Havirdhanim refers to a cow required for supplying havis, or ghee, for the performance of ritualistic ceremonies in sacrifices.</p>
<p>In human life, one should be trained to perform yajnas.</p>
<p>As we are informed in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: if we do not perform yajna, we shall simply work very hard for sense gratification like dogs and hogs.</p>
<p>This is not civilization.</p>
<p>A human being should be trained to perform yajna.</p>
<p>Yajnad bhavati parjanyah (Bg.3.14).</p>
<p>If yajnas are regularly performed, there will be proper rain from the sky, and when there is regular rainfall, the land will be fertile and suitable for producing all the necessities of life.</p>
<p>Yajna, therefore, is essential.</p>
<p>For performing yajna, clarified butter is essential, and for clarified butter, cow protection is essential.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we neglect the Vedic way of civilization, we shall certainly suffer.</p>
<p>So-called scholars and philosophers do not know the secret of success in life, and therefore they suffer in the hands of prakrti, nature (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, although they are forced to suffer, they think they are advancing in civilization (ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate).</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is therefore meant to revive a mode of civilization in which everyone will be happy.</p>
<p>This is the motive of our Krsna consciousness movement.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-14" id="summary-14">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#916-1" id="916-1">9.16</a></h3>
<p>When Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described in this chapter, Parasurama rid the entire world of ksatriyas twenty-one times.</p>
<p>This chapter also describes the descendants of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>When Jamadagni’s wife, Renuka, went to bring water from the Ganges and saw the King of the Gandharvas enjoying the company of Apsaras, she was captivated, and she slightly desired to associate with him.</p>
<p>Because of this sinful desire, she was punished by her husband.</p>
<p>Parasurama killed his mother and brothers, but later, by dint of the austerities of Jamadagni, they were revived.</p>
<p>The sons of Kartaviryarjuna, however, remembering the death of their father, wanted to take revenge against Lord Parasurama, and therefore when Parasurama was absent from the asrama, they killed Jamadagni, who was meditating on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>When Parasurama returned to the asrama and saw his father killed, he was very sorry, and after asking his brothers to take care of the dead body, he went out with determination to kill all the ksatriyas on the surface of the world.</p>
<p>Taking up his axe, he went to Mahismati-pura, the capital of Kartaviryarjuna, and killed all of Kartaviryarjuna’s sons, whose blood became a great river.</p>
<p>Parasurama, however, was not satisfied with killing only the sons of Kartaviryarjuna; later, when the ksatriyas became disturbing, he killed them twenty-one times, so that there were no ksatriyas on the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Parasurama joined the head of his father to the dead body and performed various sacrifices to please the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Thus Jamadagni got life again in his body, and later he was promoted to the higher planetary system known as Saptarsi-mandala.</p>
<p>Parasurama, the son of Jamadagni, still lives in Mahendra-parvata.</p>
<p>In the next manvantara, he will become a preacher of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Gadhi, the most powerful Visvamitra took birth.</p>
<p>By dint of his austerity and penance, he became a brahmana.</p>
<p>He had 101 sons, who were celebrated as the Madhucchandas.</p>
<p>In the sacrificial arena of Hariscandra, the son of Ajigarta named Sunahsepha was meant to be sacrificed, but by the mercy of the Prajapatis he was released.</p>
<p>Thereafter, he became Devarata in the dynasty of Gadhi.</p>
<p>The fifty elder sons of Visvamitra, however, did not accept Sunahsepha as their elder brother, and therefore Visvamitra cursed them to become mlecchas, unfaithful to the Vedic civilization.</p>
<p>Visvamitra’s fifty-first son, along with his younger brothers, then accepted Sunahsepha as their eldest brother, and their father, Visvamitra, being satisfied, blessed them.</p>
<p>Thus Devarata was accepted in the dynasty of Kausika, and consequently there are different divisions of that dynasty.</p>

<p>My dear King Pariksit, the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, who were defeated by the superior strength of Parasurama, never achieved happiness, for they always remembered the killing of their father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Jamadagni was certainly very powerful due to his austerities, but because of a slight offense by his poor wife, Renuka, he ordered that she be killed.</p>
<p>This certainly was a sinful act, and therefore Jamadagni was killed by the sons of Kartaviryarjuna, as described herein.</p>
<p>Lord Parasurama was also infected by sin because of killing Kartaviryarjuna, although this was not very offensive.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether one be Kartaviryarjuna, Lord Parasurama, Jamadagni or whoever one may be, one must act very cautiously and sagaciously; otherwise one must suffer the results of sinful activities.</p>
<p>This is the lesson we receive from Vedic literature.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>With the blood of the bodies of these sons, Lord Parasurama created a ghastly river, which brought great fear to the kings who had no respect for brahminical culture.</p>
<p>Because the ksatriyas, the men of power in government, were performing sinful activities, Lord Parasurama, on the plea of retaliating for the murder of his father, rid all the ksatriyas from the face of the earth twenty-one times.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the place known as Samanta-pancaka he created nine lakes filled with their blood.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Parasurama is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and his eternal mission is paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)—to protect the devotees and annihilate the miscreants.</p>
<p>To kill all the sinful men is one among the tasks of the incarnation of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Parasurama killed all the ksatriyas twenty-one times consecutively because they were disobedient to the brahminical culture.</p>
<p>That the ksatriyas had killed his father was only a plea; the real fact is that because the ksatriyas, the ruling class, had become polluted, their position was inauspicious.</p>
<p>Brahminical culture is enjoined in the sastra, especially in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>According to the laws of nature, whether at the time of Parasurama or at the present, if the government becomes irresponsible and sinful, not caring for brahminical culture, there will certainly be an incarnation of God like Parasurama to create a devastation by fire, famine, pestilence or some other calamity.</p>
<p>Whenever the government disrespects the supremacy of the personality of Godhead and fails to protect the institution of varnasrama-dharma, it will certainly have to face such catastrophes as formerly brought about by Lord Parasurama.</p>

<p>Thereafter, having completed the ritualistic sacrificial ceremonies, Lord Parasurama took the bath known as the avabhrtha-snana.</p>
<p>Standing on the bank of the great river Sarasvati, cleared of all sins, Lord Parasurama appeared like the sun in a clear, cloudless sky.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world Karma-bandhanah refers to the repeated acceptance of one material body after another.</p>
<p>The whole problem of life is this repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>Therefore one is advised to work to perform yajna meant for satisfying Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Although Lord Parasurama was an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he had to account for sinful activities.</p>
<p>Anyone in this material world, however careful he may be, must commit some sinful activities, even though he does not want to.</p>
<p>For example, one may trample many small ants and other insects while walking on the street and kill many living beings unknowingly.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic principle of panca-yajna, five kinds of recommended sacrifice, is compulsory.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, however, there is a great concession given to people in general.</p>
<p>Yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: (SB 11.5.32) we may worship Lord Caitanya, the hidden incarnation of Krsna.</p>
<p>Krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam: although He is Krsna Himself, He always chants Hare Krsna and preaches Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One is recommended to worship this incarnation by chanting, the sankirtana-yajna.</p>
<p>The performance of sankirtana-yajna is a special concession for human society to save people from being affected by known or unknown sinful activities.</p>
<p>We are surrounded by unlimited sins, and therefore it is compulsory that one take to Krsna consciousness and chant the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>

<p>Visvamitra, the son of Maharaja Gadhi, was as powerful as the flames of fire.</p>
<p>From the position of a ksatriya, he achieved the position of a powerful brahmana by undergoing penances and austerities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Now, having narrated the history of Lord Parasurama, Sukadeva Gosvami begins the history of Visvamitra.</p>
<p>From the history of Parasurama we can understand that although Parasurama belonged to the brahminical group, he circumstantially had to work as a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Later, after finishing his work as a ksatriya, he again became a brahmana and returned to Mahendra-parvata.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can see that although Visvamitra was born in a ksatriya family, by austerities and penances he achieved the position of a brahmana.</p>
<p>These histories confirm the statements in sastra that a brahmana may become a ksatriya, a ksatriya may become a brahmana or vaisya, and a vaisya may become a brahmana, by achieving the required qualities.</p>
<p>One’s status does not depend upon birth.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.11.35) by Narada:</p>
<p>yasya yal laksanam proktam</p>
<p>pumso varnabhivyanjakam</p>
<p>yad anyatrapi drsyeta</p>
<p>tat tenaiva vinirdiset</p>
<p>If one shows the symptoms of being a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra, even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification To know who is a brahmana and who is a ksatriya, one must consider a man’s quality and work.</p>
<p>If all the unqualified sudras become so-called brahmanas and ksatriyas, social order will be impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>Thus there will be discrepancies, human society will turn into a society of animals, and the situation all over the world will be hellish.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When requested by their father to accept Sunahsepha as the eldest son, the elder fifty of the Madhucchandas, the sons of Visvamitra, did not agree.</p>
<p>Therefore Visvamitra, being angry, cursed them May all of you bad sons become mlecchas he said, being opposed to the principles of Vedic culture</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Vedic literature there are names like mleccha and yavana.</p>
<p>The mlecchas are understood to be those who do not follow the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>In former days, the mlecchas were fewer, and Visvamitra Muni cursed his sons to become mlecchas.</p>
<p>But in the present age, Kali-yuga, there is no need of cursing, for people are automatically mlecchas.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning of Kali-yuga, but at the end of Kali-yuga the entire population will consist of mlecchas because no one will follow the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>At that time the incarnation Kalki will appear.</p>
<p>Mleccha-nivaha-nidhane kalayasi kara-balam.</p>
<p>He will kill all the mlecchas indiscriminately with his sword.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-16" id="summary-16">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#918-1" id="918-1">9.18</a></h3>
<p>This chapter gives the history of King Yayati, the son of Nahusa.</p>
<p>Among Yayati’s five sons, the youngest son, Puru, accepted Yayati’s invalidity.</p>
<p>When Nahusa, who had six sons, was cursed to become a python, his eldest son, Yati, took sannyasa, and therefore the next son, Yayati, was enthroned as king.</p>
<p>By providence, Yayati married the daughter of Sukracarya.</p>
<p>Sukracarya was a brahmana and Yayati a ksatriya, but Yayati married her nonetheless.</p>
<p>Sukracarya’s daughter, named Devayani, had a girl friend named Sarmistha, who was the daughter of Vrsaparva.</p>
<p>King Yayati married Sarmistha also.</p>
<p>The history of this marriage is as follows.</p>
<p>Once Sarmistha was sporting in the water with thousands of her girl friends, and Devayani was also there.</p>
<p>When the young girls saw Lord Siva, seated on his bull with Uma, they immediately dressed themselves, but Sarmistha mistakenly put on Devayani’s clothes.</p>
<p>Devayani, being very angry, rebuked Sarmistha, who also became very angry and responded by rebuking Devayani and throwing her into a well.</p>
<p>By chance, King Yayati came to that well to drink water, and he found Devayani and rescued her.</p>
<p>Thus Devayani accepted Maharaja Yayati as her husband.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Devayani, crying loudly, told her father about Sarmistha’s behavior.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of this incident, Sukracarya was very angry and wanted to chastise Vrsaparva, Sarmistha’s father.</p>
<p>Vrsaparva, however, satisfied Sukracarya by offering Sarmistha as Devayani’s maidservant.</p>
<p>Thus Sarmistha, as the maidservant of Devayani, also went to the house of Devayani’s husband.</p>
<p>When Sarmistha found her friend Devayani with a son she also desired to have a son.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the proper time for conception, she also requested Maharaja Yayati for sex.</p>
<p>When Sarmistha became pregnant also, Devayani was very envious.</p>
<p>In great anger, she immediately left for her father’s house and told her father everything.</p>
<p>Sukracarya again became angry and cursed Maharaja Yayati to become old, but when Yayati begged Sukracarya to be merciful to him, Sukracarya gave him the benediction that he could transfer his old age and invalidity to some young man.</p>
<p>Yayati exchanged his old age for the youth of his youngest son, Puru, and thus he was able to enjoy with young girls.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King Pariksit, as the embodied soul has six senses, King Nahusa had six sons, named Yati, Yayati, Samyati, Ayati, Viyati and Krti.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#9182" id="9182">9.18.2</a></h3>
<p>rajyam naicchad yatih pitra</p>
<p>dattam tat-parinamavit</p>
<p>yatra pravistah purusa</p>
<p>atmanam navabudhyate</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>rajyam—the kingdom; na aicchat—did not accept; yatih—the eldest son, Yati; pitra—by his father; dattam—offered; tat-parinama-vit—knowing the result of becoming powerful as a king; yatra—wherein; pravistah—having entered; purusah—such a person; atmanam—self-realization; na—not; avabudhyate—will take seriously and understand.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When one enters the post of king or head of the government, one cannot understand the meaning of self-realization.</p>
<p>Knowing this, Yati, the eldest son of Nahusa, did not accept the power to rule, although it was offered by his father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Self-realization is the prime objective of human civilization, and it is regarded seriously by those who are situated in the mode of goodness and have developed the brahminical qualities.</p>
<p>Ksatriyas are generally endowed with material qualities conducive to gaining material wealth and enjoying sense gratification, but those who are spiritually advanced are not interested in material opulence.</p>
<p>Indeed, they accept only the bare necessities for a life of spiritual advancement in self-realization.</p>
<p>It is specifically mentioned here that if one enters political life, especially in the modern day, one looses the chance for human perfection.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, one can attain the highest perfection if one hears Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>This hearing is described as nityam bhagavata-sevaya (SB 1.2.18).</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit was involved in politics, but because at the end of his life he heard Srimad-Bhagavatam from Sukadeva Gosvami, he attained perfection very easily.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has therefore suggested:</p>
<p>sthane sthitah sruti-gatam tanu-van-manobhir</p>
<p>ye prayaso ’jita jito ’py asi tais tri-lokyam</p>
<p>(Bhag.10.14.3)</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one is in the mode of passion, ignorance or goodness, if one regularly hears Srimad-Bhagavatam from the self-realized soul, one is freed from the bondage of material involvement.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because Nahusa, the father of Yayati, molested Indra’s wife, Saci, who then complained to Agastya and other brahmanas, these saintly brahmanas cursed Nahusa to fall from the heavenly planets and be degraded to the status of a python.</p>
<p>Consequently, Yayati became the king.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit said: Sukracarya was a very powerful brahmana, and Maharaja Yayati was a ksatriya.</p>
<p>Therefore I am curious to know how there occurred this pratiloma marriage between a ksatriya and a brahmana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic system, marriages between ksatriyas and ksatriyas or between brahmanas and brahmanas are the general custom.</p>
<p>If marriages sometimes take place between different classes, these marriages are of two types, namely anuloma and pratiloma.</p>
<p>Anuloma, marriage between a brahmana and the daughter of a ksatriya, is permissible, but pratiloma, marriage between a ksatriya and the daughter of a brahmana, is not generally allowed.</p>
<p>Therefore Maharaja Pariksit was curious about how Sukracarya, a powerful brahmana, could accept the principle of pratiloma.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit was eager to know the cause for this uncommon marriage.</p>

<p>The garden was full of lotuses and trees of flowers and fruits and was inhabited by sweetly singing birds and bumblebees.</p>

<p>And we are even more respectable because we are in the dynasty of Bhrgu.</p>

<p>You beggar, since you don’t understand your position, why should you unnecessarily talk so much? Don’t all of you wait at our house, depending on us for your livelihood like crows?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Crows have no independent life; they fully depend on the remnants of foodstuffs thrown by householders into the garbage tank.</p>
<p>Therefore, because a brahmana depends on his disciples, when Sarmistha was heavily rebuked by Devayani she charged Devayani with belonging to a family of crowlike beggars.</p>

<p>While taking Devayani out of the well, King Yayati must certainly have appreciated her youthful beauty, and therefore he might have asked her which caste she belonged to.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of falling in the well, I met you.</p>
<p>Indeed, this has been arranged by providence.</p>
<p>After I cursed Kaca, the son of the learned scholar Brhaspati, he cursed me by saying that I would not have a brahmana for a husband.</p>
<p>Therefore, O mighty-armed one, there is no possibility of my becoming the wife of a brahmana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kaca, the son of the learned celestial priest Brhaspati, had been a student of Sukracarya, from whom he had learned the art of reviving a man who has died untimely.</p>
<p>This art, called mrta-sanjivani, was especially used during wartime.</p>
<p>When there was a war, soldiers would certainly die untimely, but if a soldier’s body was intact, he could be brought to life again by this art of mrta-sanjivani.</p>
<p>This art was known to Sukracarya and many others, and Kaca, the son of Brhaspati, became Sukracarya’s student to learn it.</p>
<p>Devayani desired to have Kaca as her husband, but Kaca, out of regard for Sukracarya, looked upon the guru’s daughter as a respectable superior and therefore refused to marry her.</p>
<p>Devayani angrily cursed Kaca by saying that although he had learned the art of mrta-sanjivani from her father, it would be useless.</p>
<p>When cursed in this way, Kaca retaliated by cursing Devayani never to have a husband who was a brahmana.</p>
<p>Because Devayani liked Yayati, who was a ksatriya, she requested him to accept her as his bona fide wife.</p>
<p>Although this would be pratiloma-vivaha, a marriage between the daughter of a high family and the son of a lower family, she explained that this arrangement was made by providence.</p>

<p>yayatih—King Yayati; anabhipretam—not liked; daiva-upahrtam—brought about by providential arrangements; atmanah—his personal interest; manah—mind; tu—however; tat-gatam—being attracted to her; buddhva—by such intelligence; pratijagraha—accepted; tat-vacah—the words of Devayani.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Because such a marriage is not sanctioned by regular scriptures, King Yayati did not like it, but because it was arranged by providence and because he was attracted by Devayani’s beauty, he accepted her request.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic system, the parents would consider the horoscopes of the boy and girl who were to be married.</p>
<p>If according to astrological calculations the boy and girl were compatible in every respect, the match was called yotaka and the marriage would be accepted.</p>
<p>Even fifty years ago, this system was current in Hindu society.</p>
<p>Regardless of the affluence of the boy or the personal beauty of the girl, without this astrological compatibility the marriage would not take place.</p>
<p>A person is born in one of three categories, known as deva-gana, manusya-gana and raksasa-gana.</p>
<p>In different parts of the universe there are demigods and demons, and in human society also some people resemble demigods whereas others resemble demons.</p>
<p>If according to astrological calculations there was conflict between a godly and a demoniac nature, the marriage would not take place.</p>
<p>Similarly, there were calculations of pratiloma and anuloma.</p>
<p>The central idea is that if the boy and girl were on an equal level the marriage would be happy, whereas inequality would lead to unhappiness.</p>
<p>Because care is no longer taken in marriage, we now find many divorces.</p>
<p>Indeed, divorce has now become a common affair, although formerly one’s marriage would continue lifelong, and the affection between husband and wife was so great that the wife would voluntarily die when her husband died or would remain a faithful widow throughout her entire life.</p>
<p>Now, of course, this is no longer possible, for human society has fallen to the level of animal society.</p>
<p>Marriage now takes place simply by agreement.</p>
<p>Dampatye ’bhirucir hetuh (Bhag.12.2.3).</p>
<p>The word abhiruci means agreement If the boy and girl simply agree to marry, the marriage takes place.</p>
<p>But when the Vedic system is not rigidly observed, marriage frequently ends in divorce.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As Sukracarya listened to what had happened to Devayani, his mind was very much aggrieved.</p>
<p>Condemning the profession of priesthood and praising the profession of uncha-vrtti (collecting grains from the fields), he left home with his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When a brahmana adopts the profession of a kapota, or pigeon, he lives by collecting grains from the field.</p>
<p>This is called uncha-vrtti.</p>
<p>A brahmana who takes to this uncha-vrtti profession is called first class because he depends completely on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and does not beg from anyone.</p>
<p>Although the profession of begging is allowed for a brahmana or sannyasi, one does better if he can avoid such a profession and completely depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead for maintenance.</p>
<p>Sukracarya was certainly very sorry that because of his daughter’s complaint he had to go to his disciple to beg some mercy, which he was obliged to do because he had accepted the profession of priesthood.</p>
<p>In his heart, Sukracarya did not like his profession, but since he had accepted it, he was obliged to go unwillingly to his disciple to settle the grievance submitted by his daughter.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a great personality like Sukracarya cannot neglect sons and daughters, for sons and daughters are by nature dependent on their father and the father has affection for them.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Vrsaparva wisely thought that Sukracarya’s displeasure would bring danger and that his pleasure would bring material gain.</p>
<p>Therefore he carried out Sukracarya’s order and served him like a slave.</p>
<p>He gave his daughter Sarmistha to Devayani, and Sarmistha served Devayani like a slave, along with thousands of other women.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of these affairs concerning Sarmistha and Devayani, we saw that Sarmistha had many friends.</p>
<p>Now these friends became maidservants of Devayani.</p>
<p>When a girl married a ksatriya king, it was customary for all her girl friends to go with her to her husband’s house.</p>
<p>For instance, when Vasudeva married Devaki, the mother of Krsna, he married all six of her sisters, and she also had many friends who accompanied her.</p>
<p>A king would maintain not only his wife but also the many friends and maidservants of his wife.</p>
<p>Some of these maidservants would become pregnant and give birth to children.</p>
<p>Such children were accepted as dasi-putra, the sons of the maidservants, and the king would maintain them.</p>
<p>The female population is always greater than the male, but since a woman needs to be protected by a man, the king would maintain many girls, who acted either as friends or as maidservants of the queen.</p>
<p>In the history of Krsna’s household life we find that Krsna married 16,108 wives.</p>
<p>These were not maidservants but direct queens, and Krsna expanded Himself into 16,108 forms to maintain different establishments for each and every wife.</p>
<p>This is not possible for ordinary men.</p>
<p>Therefore although the kings had to maintain many, many servants and wives, not all of them had different establishments.</p>

<p>When Princess Sarmistha begged King Yayati for a son, the King was certainly aware of the principles of religion, and therefore he agreed to fulfill her desire.</p>
<p>Although he remembered the warning of Sukracarya, he thought of this union as the desire of the Supreme, and thus he had sex with Sarmistha.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>King Yayati was completely aware of the duty of a ksatriya.</p>
<p>When a ksatriya is approached by a woman, he cannot deny her.</p>
<p>This is a religious principle.</p>
<p>Consequently, when Dharmaraja, Yudhisthira, saw Arjuna unhappy after Arjuna returned from Dvaraka, he asked whether Arjuna had refused a woman who had begged for a son.</p>
<p>Although Maharaja Yayati remembered Sukracarya’s warning, he could not refuse Sarmistha.</p>
<p>He thought it wise to give her a son, and thus he had sexual intercourse with her after her menstrual period.</p>
<p>This kind of lust is not against religious principles.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.11), dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo ’smi: sex life not contrary to the principles of religion is sanctioned by Krsna.</p>
<p>Because Sarmistha, the daughter of a king, had begged Yayati for a son, their combination was not lust but an act of religion.</p>

<p>But if you are kind to me, you can take the old age given by your maternal grandfather, and I may take your youth so that I may enjoy life for a few years more.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the nature of lusty desires.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (7.20) it is said, kamais tais tair hrta jnanah: when one is too attached to sense gratification, he actually loses his sense.</p>
<p>The word hrta jnanah refers to one who has lost his sense.</p>
<p>Here is an example: the father shamelessly asked his son to exchange youth for old age.</p>
<p>Of course, the entire world is under such illusion.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said that everyone is pramattah, or exclusively mad.</p>
<p>Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: (Bhag.5.5.4) when one becomes almost like a madman, he indulges in sex and sense gratification.</p>
<p>Sex and sense gratification can be controlled, however, and one achieves perfection when he has no desires for sex.</p>
<p>This is possible only when one is fully Krsna conscious yadavadhi mama cetah krsna-padaravinde</p>
<p>nava-nava-rasa-dhamany udyatam rantum asit</p>
<p>tadavadhi bata nari-sangame smaryamane</p>

<p>Since I have been engaged in the transcendental loving service of Krsna, realizing ever-new pleasure in Him, whenever I think of sex pleasure, I spit at the thought, and my lips curl with distaste Sexual desire can be stopped only when one is fully Krsna conscious, and not otherwise.</p>
<p>As long as one has desires for sex, one must change his body and transmigrate from one body to another to enjoy sex in different species or forms.</p>
<p>But although the forms may differ, the business of sex is the same.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, punah punas carvita-carvananam (SB 7.5.30).</p>
<p>Those who are very much attached to sex transmigrate from one body to another, with the same business of chewing the chewed tasting sex enjoyment as a dog, sex enjoyment as a hog, sex enjoyment as a demigod, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Yadu replied: My dear father, you have already achieved old age, although you also were a young man.</p>
<p>But I do not welcome your old age and invalidity, for unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Renunciation of material enjoyment is the ultimate goal of human life.</p>
<p>Therefore the varnasrama institution is most scientific.</p>
<p>It aims at giving one the facility to return home, back to Godhead, which one cannot do without completely renouncing all connections with the material world.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, niskincanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya: one who wants to go back home, back to Godhead, must be niskincana, free from all affinity for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Brahmany upasamasrayam: unless one is fully renounced, one cannot engage in devotional service or stay in Brahman.</p>
<p>Devotional service is rendered on the Brahman platform.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless one attains the Brahman platform, or spiritual platform, one cannot engage in devotional service; or, in other words, a person engaged in devotional service is already on the Brahman platform mam ca yo ’vyabhicarena</p>
<p>bhakti-yogena sevate</p>
<p>sa gunan samatityaitan</p>
<p>brahma-bhuyaya kalpate</p>
<p>One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman (Bg.14.26) If one attains devotional service, therefore, he is certainly liberated.</p>
<p>Generally, unless one enjoys material happiness, one cannot attain renunciation.</p>
<p>Varnasrama therefore gives the opportunity for gradual elevation.</p>
<p>Yadu, the son of Maharaja Yayati, explained that he was unable to give up his youth, for he wanted to use it to attain the renounced order in the future.</p>
<p>Maharaja Yadu was different from his brothers.</p>

<p>Maharaja Yadu’s brothers refused to accept their father’s proposal because they were not completely aware of dharma.</p>
<p>To accept orders that follow religious principles, especially the orders of one’s father, is very important.</p>
<p>Therefore when the brothers of Maharaja Yadu refused their father’s order, this was certainly irreligious.</p>
<p>Maharaja Yadu’s refusal, however, was religious.</p>
<p>As stated in the Tenth Canto, yados ca dharma-silaya: Maharaja Yadu was completely aware of the principles of religion.</p>
<p>The ultimate principle of religion is to engage oneself in devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Maharaja Yadu was very eager to engage himself in the Lord’s service, but there was an impediment: during youth the material desire to enjoy the material senses is certainly present, and unless one fully satisfies these lusty desires in youth, there is a chance of one’s being disturbed in rendering service to the Lord.</p>
<p>We have actually seen that many sannyasis who accept sannyasa prematurely, not having satisfied their material desires, fall down because they are disturbed.</p>
<p>Therefore the general process is to go through grhastha life and vanaprastha life and finally come to sannyasa and devote oneself completely to the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Maharaja Yadu was ready to accept his father’s order and exchange youth for old age because he was confident that the youth taken by his father would be returned.</p>
<p>But because this exchange would delay his complete engagement in devotional service, he did not want to accept his father’s old age, for he was eager to achieve freedom from disturbances.</p>
<p>Moreover, among the descendants of Yadu would be Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, because Yadu was eager to see the Lord’s appearance in his dynasty as soon as possible, Yadu refused to accept his father’s proposal.</p>
<p>This was not irreligious, however, because Yadu’s purpose was to serve the Lord.</p>
<p>Because Yadu was a faithful servant of the Lord, Lord Krsna appeared in his dynasty.</p>
<p>As confirmed in the prayers of Kunti, yadoh priyasyanvavaye.</p>
<p>Yadu was very dear to Krsna, who was therefore eager to descend in Yadu’s dynasty.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Maharaja Yadu should not be considered adharma jna, ignorant of religious principles, as the next verse designates his brothers.</p>
<p>He was like the four Sanakas (catuh-sana), who refused the order of their father, Brahma, for the sake of a better cause.</p>
<p>Because the four Kumaras wanted to engage themselves completely in the service of the Lord as brahmacaris, their refusal to obey their father’s order was not irreligious.</p>

<p>Puru replied: O Your Majesty, who in this world can repay his debt to his father? By the mercy of one’s father, one gets the human form of life, which can enable one to become an associate of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The father gives the seed of the body, and this seed gradually grows and develops until one ultimately attains the developed human body, with consciousness higher than that of the animals.</p>
<p>In the human body one can be elevated to the higher planets, and, furthermore, if one cultivates Krsna consciousness, one can return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This important human body is obtained by the grace of the father, and therefore everyone is indebted to his father.</p>
<p>Of course, in other lives one also gets a father and mother; even cats and dogs have fathers and mothers.</p>
<p>But in the human form of life the father and mother can award their son the greatest benediction by teaching him to become a devotee.</p>
<p>When one becomes a devotee, he achieves the greatest benediction because he completely averts the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>Therefore the father who trains his child in Krsna consciousness is the most benevolent father in this world.</p>
<p>It is said:</p>
<p>janame janame sabe pita mata paya</p>
<p>krsna guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei</p>
<p>Everyone gets a father and mother, but if one gets the benediction of Krsna and guru, he can conquer material nature and return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-17" id="summary-17">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#919-1" id="919-1">9.19</a></h3>
<p>This Nineteenth Chapter describes how Maharaja Yayati achieved liberation after he recounted the figurative story of the he-goat and she-goat.</p>
<p>After many, many years of sexual relationships and enjoyment in the material world, King Yayati finally became disgusted with such materialistic happiness.</p>
<p>When satiated with material enjoyment, he devised a story of a he-goat and she-goat, corresponding to his own life, and narrated the story before his beloved Devayani.</p>
<p>The story is as follows.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, while a goat was searching in a forest for different types of vegetables to eat, by chance he came to a well, in which he saw a she-goat.</p>
<p>He became attracted to this she-goat and somehow or other delivered her from the well, and thus they were united.</p>
<p>One day thereafter, when the she-goat saw the he-goat enjoying sex with another she-goat, she became angry, abandoned the he-goat, and returned to her brahmana owner, to whom she described her husband’s behavior.</p>
<p>The brahmana became very angry and cursed the he-goat to lose his sexual power.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the he-goat begged the brahmana’s pardon and was given back the power for sex.</p>
<p>Then the he-goat enjoyed sex with the she-goat for many years, but still he was not satisfied.</p>
<p>If one is lusty and greedy, even the total stock of gold in this world cannot satisfy one’s lusty desires.</p>
<p>These desires are like a fire.</p>
<p>One may pour clarified butter on a blazing fire, but one cannot expect the fire to be extinguished.</p>
<p>To extinguish such a fire, one must adopt a different process.</p>
<p>The sastra therefore advises that by intelligence one renounce the life of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Without great endeavor, those with a poor fund of knowledge cannot give up sense enjoyment, especially in relation to sex, because a beautiful woman bewilders even the most learned man.</p>
<p>King Yayati, however, renounced worldly life and divided his property among his sons.</p>
<p>He personally adopted the life of a mendicant, or sannyasi, giving up all attraction to material enjoyment, and engaged himself fully in devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus he attained perfection.</p>
<p>Later, when his beloved wife, Devayani, was freed from her mistaken way of life, she also engaged herself in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dearly beloved wife, daughter of Sukracarya, in this world there was someone exactly like me.</p>
<p>Please listen as I narrate the history of his life.</p>
<p>By hearing about the life of such a householder, those who have retired from householder life always lament.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Persons who live in the village or town are called grama-nivasi, and those who live in the forest are called vana-vasi or vanaprastha.</p>
<p>The vanaprasthas, who have retired from family life, generally lament about their past family life because it engaged them in trying to fulfill lusty desires.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja said that one should retire from family life as soon as possible, and he described family life as the darkest well (hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam).</p>
<p>If one continuously or permanently concentrates on living with his family, he should be understood to be killing himself.</p>
<p>In the Vedic civilization, therefore, it is recommended that one retire from family life at the end of his fiftieth year and go to vana, the forest.</p>
<p>When he becomes expert or accustomed to forest life, or retired life as a vanaprastha, he should accept sannyasa.</p>
<p>Vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta (SB 7.5.5).</p>
<p>Sannyasa means accepting unalloyed engagement in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Vedic civilization therefore recommends four different stages of life—brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa.</p>
<p>One should be very much ashamed of remaining a householder and not promoting oneself to the two higher stages, namely vanaprastha and sannyasa.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While wandering in the forest, eating to satisfy his senses, a he-goat by chance approached a well, in which he saw a she-goat standing helplessly, having fallen into it by the influence of the results of fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here Maharaja Yayati compares himself to a he-goat and Devayani to a she-goat and describes the nature of man and woman.</p>
<p>Like a he-goat, a man searches for sense gratification, wandering here and there, and a woman without the shelter of a man or husband is like a she-goat that has fallen into a well.</p>
<p>Without being cared for by a man, a woman cannot be happy.</p>
<p>Indeed, she is just like a she-goat that has fallen into a well and is struggling for existence.</p>
<p>Therefore a woman must take shelter of her father, as Devayani did when under the care of Sukracarya, and then the father must give the daughter in charity to a suitable man, or a suitable man should help the woman by placing her under the care of a husband.</p>
<p>This is shown vividly by the life of Devayani.</p>
<p>When King Yayati delivered Devayani from the well, she felt great relief and requested Yayati to accept her as his wife.</p>
<p>But when Maharaja Yayati accepted Devayani, he became too attached and had sex life not only with her but with others, like Sarmistha.</p>
<p>Yet still he was dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Therefore one should retire by force from such family life as Yayati’s.</p>
<p>When one is fully convinced of the degrading nature of worldly family life, one should completely renounce this way of life, take sannyasa, and engage himself fully in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then one’s life will be successful.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Attraction for woman is the impetus for economic development, housing and many other things meant for living comfortably in this material world.</p>
<p>Digging up the earth to make a way out for the she-goat was a laborious task, but before accepting the she-goat, the he-goat underwent this labor.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the she-goat, who had very nice hips, got out of the well and saw the very handsome he-goat, she desired to accept him as her husband.</p>
<p>When she did so, many other she-goats also desired him as their husband because he had a very beautiful bodily structure and a nice mustache and beard and was expert in discharging semen and in the art of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Therefore, just as a person haunted by a ghost exhibits madness, the best of the he-goats, attracted by the many she-goats, engaged in erotic activities and naturally forgot his real business of self-realization.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Materialists are certainly very much attracted by sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham (SB 7.9.45).</p>
<p>Although one becomes a grhastha, or householder, to enjoy sex life to his heart’s content, one is never satisfied.</p>
<p>Such a lusty materialist is like a goat, for it is said that if goats meant for slaughter get the opportunity, they enjoy sex before being killed.</p>
<p>Human beings, however, are meant for self-realization tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam</p>
<p>suddhyed yasmad brahma-saukhyam tv anantam</p>
<p>Human life is meant for realization of the self, the spiritual soul within the body (dehino ’smin yatha dehe (Bg.2.13)).</p>
<p>A materialistic rascal does not know that he is not the body but a spiritual soul within the body.</p>
<p>However, one should understand his real position and cultivate knowledge by which to get free from bodily entanglement.</p>
<p>Like an unfortunate person who acts madly, haunted by ghosts, a materialist haunted by the ghost of lust forgets his real business so that he can enjoy so-called happiness in the bodily concept of life.</p>

<p>Aggrieved by her husband’s behavior with another, the she-goat thought that the he-goat was not actually her friend but was hardhearted and was her friend only for the time being.</p>

<p>Svami means caretake or master Devayani was cared for by Sukracarya before her marriage, and after her marriage she was cared for by Yayati, but here the word svaminam indicates that Devayani left the protection of her husband, Yayati, and returned to her former protector, Sukracarya.</p>
<p>Vedic civilization recommends that a woman stay under the protection of a man.</p>
<p>During childhood she should be cared for by her father, in youth by her husband, and in old age by a grown son.</p>
<p>In any stage of life, a woman should not have independence.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The she-goat went to the residence of a brahmana who was the maintainer of another she-goat, and that brahmana angrily cut off the he-goat’s dangling testicles.</p>
<p>But at the he-goat’s request, the brahmana later rejoined them by the power of mystic yoga.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here Sukracarya is figuratively described as the husband of another she-goat.</p>
<p>This indicates that the relationship between husband and wife in any society, whether higher or lower than human society, is nothing but the same relationship between he-goat and she-goat, for the material relationship between man and woman is one of sex.</p>
<p>Yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham (SB 7.9.45).</p>
<p>Sukracarya was an acarya, or expert, in family affairs, which involve the transfer of semen from he-goat to she-goat, The words kascid aja-svami expressly indicate herein that Sukracarya was no better than Yayati, for both of them were interested in family affairs generated by sukra, or semen.</p>
<p>Sukracarya first cursed Yayati to become old so that he could no longer indulge in sex, but when Sukracarya saw that Yayati’s emasculation would make his own daughter a victim of punishment, he used his mystic power to restore Yayati’s masculinity.</p>
<p>Because he used his power of mystic yoga for family affairs and not to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this exercise in the magic of yoga was no better than the affairs of he-goats and she-goats.</p>
<p>Yogic power should properly be used to realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>When one is bound by affection for one’s wife, one is attached to sexual desires that are very difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>Human life is meant for such tapasya, or austerity.</p>
<p>By the austerity of voluntarily stopping sex life at home and going to the forest to engage in spiritual activities in the association of devotees, one achieves the actual purpose of human life.</p>

<p>Prabodhananda Sarasvati said, visvam purna-sukhayate: when one becomes Krsna conscious by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, for him the entire world appears happy, and he has nothing for which to hanker.</p>
<p>On the brahma-bhuta stage, or the platform of spiritual realization, there is no lamentation and no material hankering (na socati na kanksati).</p>

<p>For those who are too attached to material enjoyment, sense gratification is very difficult to give up.</p>

<p>Therefore, one who actually desires happiness must give up such unsatisfied desires, which are the cause of all tribulations.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>We have actually seen, especially in the Western countries, that men who have reached more than eighty years of age still go to nightclubs and pay heavy fees to drink wine and associate with women.</p>
<p>Although such men are too old to enjoy anything, their desires have not ceased.</p>
<p>Time deteriorates even the body itself, which is the medium for all sensual satisfaction, but even when a man becomes old and invalid, his desires are strong enough to dictate that he go here and there to satisfy the desires of his senses.</p>
<p>Therefore, by the practice of bhakti-yoga, one should give up his lusty desires.</p>
<p>As explained by Sri Yamunacarya:</p>

<p>An experienced, advanced devotee is no longer interested in sex life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One should not allow oneself to sit on the same seat even with one’s own mother, sister or daughter, for the senses are so strong that even though one is very advanced in knowledge, he may be attracted by sex.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Learning the etiquette of how to deal with women does not free one from sexual attraction.</p>
<p>As specifically mentioned herewith, such attraction is possible even with one’s mother, sister or daughter.</p>
<p>Generally, of course, one is not sexually attracted to his mother, sister or daughter, but if one allows himself to sit very close to such a woman, one may be attracted.</p>
<p>This is a psychological fact.</p>
<p>It may be said that one is liable to be attracted if he is not very advanced in civilized life; however, as specifically mentioned here, vidvamsam api karsati: even if one is highly advanced, materially or spiritually, he may be attracted by lusty desires.</p>
<p>The object of attraction may even be one’s mother, sister or daughter.</p>
<p>Therefore, one should be extremely careful in dealings with women.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was most strict in such dealings, especially after He accepted the sannyasa order.</p>
<p>Indeed, no woman could come near Him to offer Him respect.</p>
<p>Again, one is warned herewith that one should be extremely careful in dealings with women.</p>
<p>A brahmacari is forbidden even to see the wife of his spiritual master if she happens to be young.</p>
<p>The wife of the spiritual master may sometimes take some service from the disciple of her husband, as she would from a son, but if the wife of the spiritual master is young, a brahmacari is forbidden to render service to her.</p>

<p>Therefore, I shall now give up all these desires and meditate upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Free from the dualities of mental concoction and free from false prestige, I shall wander in the forest with the animals.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To go to the forest and live there with the animals, meditating upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only means by which to give up lusty desires.</p>
<p>Unless one gives up such desires, one’s mind cannot be freed from material contamination.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one is at all interested in being freed from the bondage of repeated birth, death, old age and disease, after a certain age one must go to the forest pancasordhvam vanam vrajet.</p>
<p>After fifty years of age, one should voluntarily give up family life and go to the forest.</p>
<p>The best forest is Vrndavana, where one need not live with the animals but can associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who never leaves Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Cultivating Krsna consciousness in Vrndavana is the best means of being liberated from material bondage, for in Vrndavana one can automatically meditate upon Krsna.</p>
<p>Vrndavana has many temples, and in one or more of these temples one may see the form of the Supreme Lord as Radha-Krsna or Krsna-Balarama and meditate upon this form.</p>
<p>As expressed here by the words brahmany adhyaya, one should concentrate one’s mind upon the Supreme Lord, Parabrahman.</p>
<p>This Parabrahman is Krsna, as confirmed by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita (param brahma param dhama pavitram paramam bhavan (Bg.10.12)).</p>
<p>Krsna and His abode, Vrndavana, are not different.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, aradhyo bhagavan vrajesa-tanayas tad-dhama vrndavanam.</p>
<p>Vrndavana is as good as Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one somehow or other gets the opportunity to live in Vrndavana, and if one is not a pretender but simply lives in Vrndavana and concentrates his mind upon Krsna, one is liberated from material bondage.</p>
<p>One’s mind is not purified, however, even in Vrndavana, if one is agitated by lusty desires.</p>
<p>One should not live in Vrndavana and commit offenses, for a life of offenses in Vrndavana is no better than the lives of the monkeys and hogs there.</p>
<p>Many monkeys and hogs live in Vrndavana, and they are concerned with their sexual desires.</p>
<p>Men who have gone to Vrndavana but who still hanker for sex should immediately leave Vrndavana and stop their grievous offenses at the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>There are many misguided men who live in Vrndavana to satisfy their sexual desires, but they are certainly no better than the monkeys and hogs.</p>
<p>Those who are under the control of maya, and specifically under the control of lusty desires, are called maya-mrga.</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone in the conditional stage of material life is a maya-mrga.</p>
<p>It is said, maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad: (SB 11.5.34) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa to show His causeless mercy to the maya-mrgas, the people of this material world, who suffer because of lusty desires.</p>
<p>One should follow the principles of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and always think of Krsna in full Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Then one will be eligible to live in Vrndavana, and his life will be successful.</p>

<p>One who knows that material happiness, whether good or bad, in this life or in the next, on this planet or on the heavenly planets, is temporary and useless, and that an intelligent person should not try to enjoy or even think of such things, is the knower of the self.</p>
<p>Such a self-realized person knows quite well that material happiness is the very cause of continued material existence and forgetfulness of one’s own constitutional position.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The living entity is a spiritual soul, and the material body is his encagement.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of spiritual understanding dehino ’smin yatha dehe</p>
<p>kaumaram yauvanam jara</p>
<p>tatha dehantara-praptir</p>
<p>dhiras tatra na muhyati</p>
<p>As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change (Bg.2.13) The real mission of human life is to get free from encagement in the material body.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna descends to teach the conditioned soul about spiritual realization and how to become free from material bondage.</p>
<p>Yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata (Bg.4.7).</p>
<p>The words dharmasya glanih mean pollution of one’s existence Our existence is now polluted, and it must be purified (sattvam suddhyet).</p>
<p>The human life is meant for this purification, not for thinking of happiness in terms of the external body, which is the cause of material bondage.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this verse, Maharaja Yayati advises that whatever material happiness we see and whatever is promised for enjoyment is all merely flickering and temporary.</p>
<p>Abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino ’rjuna (Bg.8.16).</p>
<p>Even if one is promoted to Brahmaloka, if one is not freed from material bondage one must return to this planet earth and continue in the miserable condition of material existence (bhutva bhutva praliyate).</p>
<p>One should always keep this understanding in mind so as not to be allured by any kind of sense enjoyment, in this life or in the next.</p>
<p>One who is fully aware of this truth is self-realized (sa atma-drk), but aside from him, everyone suffers in the cycle of birth and death (mrtyu-samsara-vartmani).</p>
<p>This understanding is one of true intelligence, and anything contrary to this is but a cause of unhappiness.</p>
<p>Krsna-bhakta—niskama, ataeva ‘santa.’ Only a Krsna conscious person, who knows the aim and object of life, is peaceful.</p>
<p>All others, whether karmis, jnanis or yogis, are restless and cannot enjoy real peace.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Having enjoyed sense gratification for many, many years, O King Pariksit, Yayati was accustomed to it, but he gave it up entirely in a moment, just as a bird flies away from the nest as soon as its wings have grown.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>That Maharaja Yayati was immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life is certainly astonishing.</p>
<p>But the example given herewith is appropriate.</p>
<p>A tiny baby bird, dependent fully on its father and mother even to eat, suddenly flies away from the nest when its wings have grown.</p>
<p>Similarly, if one fully surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is immediately liberated from the bondage of conditioned life, as promised by the Lord Himself (aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami).</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):</p>
<p>kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa</p>
<p>abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah</p>
<p>ye ’nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah</p>
<p>sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah</p>
<p>Kirata, Huna, Andhra, Pulinda, Pulkasa, Abhira, Sumbha, Yavana and the Khasa races and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power.</p>
<p>I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him Lord Visnu is so powerful that He can deliver anyone at once if He is pleased to do so.</p>
<p>And Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, can be pleased immediately if we accept His order by surrendering unto Him, as Maharaja Yayati did.</p>
<p>Maharaja Yayati was eager to serve Vasudeva, Krsna, and therefore as soon as he wanted to renounce material life, Lord Vasudeva helped him.</p>
<p>We must therefore be very sincere in surrendering ourselves unto the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then we can immediately be liberated from all the bondage of conditioned life.</p>
<p>This is clearly expressed in the next verse.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#91925" id="91925">9.19.25</a></h3>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sah—Maharaja Yayati; tatra—upon doing this; nirmukta—was immediately liberated from; samasta-sangah—all contamination; atma-anubhutya—simply by understanding his constitutional position; vidhuta—was cleansed of; tri-lingah—the contamination caused by the three modes of material nature (sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna); pare—unto the Transcendence; amale—without material contact; brahmani—the Supreme Lord; vasudeve—Vasudeva, Krsna, the Absolute Truth, Bhagavan; lebhe—achieved; gatim—the destination; bhagavatim—as an associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; pratitah—famous.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because King Yayati completely surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vasudeva, he was freed from all contamination of the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>Because of his self-realization, he was able to fix his mind upon the Transcendence (Parabrahman, Vasudeva), and thus he ultimately achieved the position of an associate of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word vidhuta, meaning cleansed is very significant.</p>
<p>Everyone in this material world is contaminated (karanam guna-sango ’sya).</p>
<p>Because we are in a material condition, we are contaminated either by sattva-guna, by rajo-guna or by tamo-guna.</p>
<p>Even if one becomes a qualified brahmana in the mode of goodness (sattva-guna), he is still materially contaminated.</p>
<p>One must come to the platform of suddha-sattva, transcending the sattva-guna.</p>
<p>Then one is vidhuta-trilinga, cleansed of the contamination caused by the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>This is possible by the mercy of Krsna.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):</p>
<p>srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah</p>
<p>punya-sravana-kirtanah</p>
<p>hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani</p>
<p>vidhunoti suhrt-satam</p>
<p>Sri Krsna, the personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma (Supersoul) in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted A person trying to be perfectly Krsna conscious by hearing the words of Krsna from Srimad-Bhagavatam or Bhagavad-gita certainly has all the dirty things cleansed from the core of his heart.</p>
<p>Caitanya Mahaprabhu also says, ceto-darpana-marjanam: (Cc.Antya 20.12) the process of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord washes away the dirty things accumulated in the core of the heart.</p>
<p>As soon as one is freed from all the dirt of material contamination, as Maharaja Yayati was, one’s original position as an associate of the Lord is revealed.</p>
<p>This is called svarupa-siddhi, or personal perfection.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Devayani heard Maharaja Yayati’s story of the he-goat and she-goat, she understood that this story, which was presented as if a funny joke for entertainment between husband and wife, was intended to awaken her to her constitutional position.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When one actually awakens from material life, one understands his real position as an eternal servant of Krsna.</p>
<p>This is called liberation.</p>
<p>Muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih (Bhag.2.10.6).</p>
<p>Under the influence of maya, everyone living in this material world thinks that he is the master of everything (ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>One thinks that there is no God or controller and that one is independent and can do anything.</p>
<p>This is the material condition, and when one awakens from this ignorance, he is called liberated.</p>
<p>Maharaja Yayati had delivered Devayani from the well, and finally, as a dutiful husband, he instructed her with the story about the he-goat and she-goat and thus delivered her from the misconception of material happiness.</p>
<p>Devayani was quite competent to understand her liberated husband, and therefore she decided to follow him as his faithful wife.</p>

<p>Thereafter, Devayani, the daughter of Sukracarya, understood that the materialistic association of husband, friends and relatives is like the association in a hotel full of tourists.</p>
<p>The relationships of society, friendship and love are created by the maya of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, exactly as in a dream.</p>
<p>By the grace of Krsna, Devayani gave up her imaginary position in the material world.</p>
<p>Completely fixing her mind upon Krsna, she achieved liberation from the gross and subtle bodies.</p>

<p>One should be convinced that he is a spirit soul, part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman, Krsna, but has somehow or other been entrapped by the material coverings of the gross and subtle bodies, consisting of earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego.</p>
<p>One should know that the association of society, friendship, love, nationalism, religion and so on are nothing but creations of maya.</p>
<p>One’s only business is to become Krsna conscious and render service unto Krsna as extensively as possible for a living being.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>How Devayani became self-realized by the grace of her great husband, Maharaja Yayati, is described here.</p>

<p>(SB 7.5.23) Hearing and chanting about the transcendental holy name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and pastimes of Lord Visnu, remembering them, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, offering the Lord respectful worship, offering prayers to the Lord, becoming His servant, considering the Lord one’s best friend, and surrendering everything unto Him—these nine processes are accepted as pure devotional service (Bhag.7.5.23)</p>
<p>sravanam kirtanam, hearing and chanting, are especially important.</p>
<p>By hearing from her husband about the greatness of Lord Vasudeva, Devayani certainly became convinced and surrendered herself unto the lotus feet of the Lord (om namo bhagavate vasudevaya).</p>
<p>This is knowledge.</p>

<p>Because of her association with her great husband, Maharaja Yayati, Devayani became purified, adopted the means of bhakti-yoga, and thus became liberated.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#920" id="920">9.20</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the history of Puru and his descendant Dusmanta.</p>
<p>The son of Puru was Janamejaya, and his son was Pracinvan.</p>
<p>The sons and grandsons in the line of Pracinvan, one after another, were Pravira, Manusyu, Carupada, Sudyu, Bahugava, Samyati, Ahamyati and Raudrasva.</p>
<p>Raudrasva had ten sons—Rteyu, Kakseyu, Sthandileyu, Krteyuka, Jaleyu, Sannateyu, Dharmeyu, Satyeyu, Vrateyu and Vaneyu.</p>
<p>The son of Rteyu was Rantinava, who had three sons—Sumati, Dhruva and Apratiratha.</p>
<p>The son of Apratiratha was Kanva, and Kanva’s son was Medhatithi.</p>
<p>The sons of Medhatithi, headed by Praskanna, were all brahmanas.</p>
<p>The son of Rantinava named Sumati had a son named Rebhi, and his son was Dusmanta.</p>
<p>While hunting in the forest, Dusmanta once approached the asrama of Maharsi Kanva, where he saw an extremely beautiful woman and became attracted to her.</p>
<p>That woman was the daughter of Visvamitra, and her name was Sakuntala.</p>
<p>Her mother was Menaka, who had left her in the forest, where Kanva Muni found her.</p>
<p>Kanva Muni brought her to his asrama, where he raised and maintained her.</p>
<p>When Sakuntala accepted Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband, he married her according to the gandharva-vidhi.</p>
<p>Sakuntala later became pregnant by her husband, who left her in the asrama of Kanva Muni and returned to his kingdom.</p>
<p>In due course of time, Sakuntala gave birth to a Vaisnava son, but Dusmanta, having returned to the capital, forgot what had taken place.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Sakuntala approached him with her newly born child, Maharaja Dusmanta refused to accept them as his wife and son.</p>
<p>Later, however, after a mysterious omen, the King accepted them.</p>
<p>After Maharaja Dusmanta’s death, Bharata, the son of Sakuntala, was enthroned.</p>
<p>He performed many great sacrifices, in which he gave great riches in charity to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>This chapter ends by describing the birth of Bharadvaja and how Maharaja Bharata accepted Bharadvaja as his son.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Dusmanta replied: O Sakuntala, with beautiful eyebrows, you have taken your birth in the family of the great saint Visvamitra, and your reception is quite worthy of your family.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the daughters of a king generally select their own husbands.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In her reception of Maharaja Dusmanta, Sakuntala clearly said, Your Majesty may stay here, and you may accept whatever reception I can offer Thus she indicated that she wanted Maharaja Dusmanta as her husband.</p>
<p>As far as Maharaja Dusmanta was concerned, he desired Sakuntala as his wife from the very beginning, as soon as he saw her, so the agreement to unite as husband and wife was natural.</p>
<p>To induce Sakuntala to accept the marriage, Maharaja Dusmanta reminded her that as the daughter of a king she could select her husband in an open assembly.</p>
<p>In the history of Aryan civilization there have been many instances in which famous princesses have selected their husbands in open competitions.</p>
<p>For example, it was in such a competition that Sitadevi accepted Lord Ramacandra as her husband and that Draupadi accepted Arjuna, and there are many other instances.</p>
<p>So marriage by agreement or by selecting one’s own husband in an open competition is allowed.</p>
<p>There are eight kinds of marriage, of which marriage by agreement is called gandharva marriage.</p>
<p>Generally the parents select the husband or wife for their daughter or son, but gandharva marriage takes place by personal selection.</p>
<p>Still, although marriage by personal selection or by agreement took place in the past, we find no such thing as divorce by disagreement.</p>
<p>Of course, divorce by disagreement took place among low-class men, but marriage by agreement was found even in the very highest classes, especially in the royal ksatriya families.</p>
<p>Maharaja Dusmanta’s acceptance of Sakuntala as his wife was sanctioned by Vedic culture.</p>
<p>How the marriage took place is described in the next verse.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#92016" id="92016">9.20.16</a></h3>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>om iti ukte—by reciting the Vedic pranava, invoking the Supreme Personality of Godhead to witness the marriage; yatha-dharmam—exactly according to the principles of religion (because Narayana becomes the witness in an ordinary religious marriage also); upayeme—he married; sakuntalam—the girl Sakuntala; gandharva-vidhina—by the regulative principle of the Gandharvas, without deviation from religious principles; raja—Maharaja Dusmanta; desa-kala-vidhana-vit—completely aware of duties according to time, position and objective.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Sakuntala responded to Maharaja Dusmanta’s proposal with silence, the agreement was complete.</p>
<p>Then the King, who knew the laws of marriage, immediately married her by chanting the Vedic pranava (omkara), in accordance with the marriage ceremony as performed among the Gandharvas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The omkara, pranava, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead represented by letters.Bhagavad-gita says that the letters a-u-m, combined together as om, represent the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Religious principles are meant to invoke the blessings and mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-gita that He is personally present in sexual desires that are not contrary to religious principles.</p>
<p>The word vidhina means, according to religious principles The association of men and women according to religious principles is allowed in the Vedic culture.</p>
<p>In our Krsna consciousness movement we allow marriage on the basis of religious principles, but the sexual combination of men and women as friends is irreligious and is not allowed.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The voice said: O Maharaja Dusmanta, a son actually belongs to his father, whereas the mother is only a container, like the skin of a bellows.</p>
<p>According to Vedic injunctions, the father is born as the son.</p>
<p>Therefore, maintain your own son and do not insult Sakuntala.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the Vedic injunction atma vai putra-namasi, the father becomes the son.</p>
<p>The mother is simply like a storekeeper, because the seed of the child is placed in her womb, but it is the father who is responsible for maintaining the son.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says that He is the seed-giving father of all living entities (aham bija-pradah pita), and therefore He is responsible for maintaining them.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Eko bahunam yo vidadhati kaman: although God is one, He maintains all living entities with their necessities for life.</p>
<p>The living entities in different forms are sons of the Lord, and therefore the father, the Supreme Lord, supplies them food according to their different bodies.</p>
<p>The small ant is supplied a grain of sugar, and the elephant is supplied tons of food, but everyone is able to eat.</p>
<p>Therefore there is no question of overpopulation.</p>
<p>Because the father, Krsna, is fully opulent, there is no scarcity of food, and because there is no scarcity, the propaganda of overpopulation is only a myth.</p>
<p>Actually one suffers for want of food when material nature, under the order of the father, refuses to supply him food.</p>
<p>It is the living entity’s position that determines whether food will be supplied or not.</p>
<p>When a diseased person is forbidden to eat, this does not mean that there is a scarcity of food; rather, the diseased person requires the treatment of not being supplied with food.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (7.10) the Lord also says, bijam mam sama-bhutanam: I am the seed of all living entities A particular type of seed is sown within the earth, and then a particular type of tree or plant comes out.</p>
<p>The mother resembles the earth, and when a particular type of seed is sown by the father, a particular type of body takes birth.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Dusmanta, he who discharges semen is the actual father, and his son saves him from the custody of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>You are the actual procreator of this child.</p>
<p>Indeed, Sakuntala is speaking the truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Upon hearing the omen, Maharaja Dusmanta accepted his wife and child.</p>
<p>According to Vedic smrti:</p>
<p>pun-namno narakad yasmat</p>
<p>pitaram trayate sutah</p>
<p>tasmat putra iti proktah</p>
<p>svayam eva svayambhuva</p>
<p>Because a son delivers his father from punishment in the hell called put, the son is called putra.</p>
<p>According to this principle, when there is a disagreement between the father and mother, it is the father, not the mother, who is delivered by the son.</p>
<p>But if the wife is faithful and firmly adherent to her husband, when the father is delivered the mother is also delivered.</p>
<p>Consequently, there is no such thing as divorce in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>A wife is always trained to be chaste and faithful to her husband, for this helps her achieve deliverance from any abominable material condition.</p>
<p>This verse clearly says, putro nayati naradeva yama-ksayat: The son saves his father from the custody of Yamaraja It never says, putro nayati mataram: The son saves his mother The seed-giving father is delivered, not the storekeeper mother.</p>
<p>Consequently, husband and wife should not separate under any condition, for if they have a child whom they raise to be a Vaisnava, he can save both the father and mother from the custody of Yamaraja and punishment in hellish life.</p>

<p>By worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead with a grand ritualistic ceremony, he became the emperor and master of the entire world.</p>

<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.9), yajnarthat karmano ’nyatra loko ’yam karma-bandhanah: Work done as a sacrifice for Visnu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world Everyone should engage in the performance of yajna, and the sacrificial fire should be ignited everywhere, the entire purpose being to make people happy, prosperous and progressive in spiritual life.</p>
<p>Of course, these things were possible before the beginning of Kali-yuga because there were qualified brahmanas who could perform such yajnas.</p>
<p>For the present, however, the Brahma-vaivarta Purana enjoins:</p>
<p>asvamedham gavalambham</p>
<p>sannyasam pala-paitrkam</p>
<p>devarena sutotpattim</p>
<p>kalau panca vivarjayet</p>
<p>(Cc.Adi 17.164)</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: offering a horse in sacrifice, offering a cow in sacrifice, accepting the order of sannyasa, offering oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and begetting children in the wife of one’s brother In this age, such yajnas as the asvamedha-yajna and gomedha-yajna are impossible to perform because there are neither sufficient riches nor qualified brahmanas.</p>
<p>This verse says, mamateyam purodhaya: Maharaja Bharata engaged the son of Mamata, Bhrgu Muni, to take charge of performing this yajna.</p>
<p>Now, however, such brahmanas are impossible to find.</p>
<p>Therefore the sastras recommend, yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: those who are intelligent should perform the sankirtana-yajna inaugurated by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu krsna-varnam tvisakrsnam</p>
<p>sangopangastra-parsadam</p>
<p>yajnaih sankirtana-prayair</p>
<p>yajanti hi sumedhasah</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, people endowed with sufficient intelligence will worship the Lord, who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of sankirtana-yajna (Bhag.11.5.32) Yajna must be performed, for otherwise people will be entangled in sinful activities and will suffer immensely.</p>
<p>Therefore the Krsna consciousness movement has taken charge of introducing the chanting of Hare Krsna all over the world.</p>
<p>This Hare Krsna movement is also yajna, but without the difficulties involved in securing paraphernalia and qualified brahmanas.</p>
<p>This congregational chanting can be performed anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>If people somehow or other assemble together and are induced to chant Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, all the purposes of yajna will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The first purpose is that there must be sufficient rain, for without rain there cannot be any produce (annad bhavanti bhutani parjanyad anna-sambhavah).</p>
<p>All our necessities can be produced simply by rainfall (kamam vavarsa parjanyah (SB 1.10.4)), and the earth is the original source of all necessities (sarva-kama-dugha mahi).</p>
<p>In conclusion, therefore, in this age of Kali people all over the world should refrain from the four principles of sinful life—illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling—and in a pure state of existence should perform the simple yajna of chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>Then the earth will certainly produce all the necessities for life, and people will be happy economically, politically, socially, religiously and culturally.</p>
<p>Everything will be in proper order.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Mamata very much feared being forsaken by her husband for giving birth to an illegitimate son, and therefore she considered giving up the child.</p>
<p>But then the demigods solved the problem by enunciating a name for the child.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to Vedic scripture, whenever a child is born there are some ceremonies known as jata-karma and nama-karana, in which learned brahmanas, immediately after the birth of the child, make a horoscope according to astrological calculations.</p>
<p>But the child to which Mamata gave birth was begotten by Brhaspati irreligiously, for although Mamata was the wife of Utathya, Brhaspati made her pregnant by force.</p>
<p>Therefore Brhaspati became bharta.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, a wife is considered the property of her husband, and a son born by illicit sex is called dvaja.</p>
<p>The common word still current in Hindu society for such a son is dogla, which refers to a son not begotten by the husband of his mother.</p>
<p>In such a situation, it is difficult to give the child a name according to proper regulative principles.</p>
<p>Mamata, therefore, was perplexed, but the demigods gave the child the appropriate name Bharadvaja, which indicated that the child born illegitimately should be maintained by both Mamata and Brhaspati.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-19" id="summary-19">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#921-1" id="921-1">9.21</a></h3>
<p>This Twenty-first Chapter describes the dynasty born from Maharaja Bharata, the son of Maharaja Dusmanta, and it also describes the glories of Rantideva, Ajamidha and others.</p>
<p>The son of Bharadvaja was Manyu, and Manyu’s sons were Brhatksatra, Jaya, Mahavirya, Nara and Garga.</p>
<p>Of these five, Nara had a son named Sankrti, who had two sons, named Guru and Rantideva.</p>
<p>As an exalted devotee, Rantideva saw every living entity in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he completely engaged his mind, his words and his very self in the service of the Supreme Lord and His devotees.</p>
<p>Rantideva was so exalted that he would sometimes give away his own food in charity, and he and his family would fast.</p>
<p>Once, after Rantideva spent forty-eight days fasting, not even drinking water, excellent food made with ghee was brought to him, but when he was about to eat it a brahmana guest appeared.</p>
<p>Rantideva, therefore, did not eat the food, but instead immediately offered a portion of it to the brahmana.</p>
<p>When the brahmana left and Rantideva was just about to eat the remnants of the food, a sudra appeared.</p>
<p>Rantideva therefore divided the remnants between the sudra and himself.</p>
<p>Again, when he was just about to eat the remnants of the food, another guest appeared.</p>
<p>Rantideva therefore gave the rest of the food to the new guest and was about to content himself with drinking the water to quench his thirst, but this also was precluded, for a thirsty guest came and Rantideva gave him the water.</p>
<p>This was all ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to glorify His devotee and show how tolerant a devotee is in rendering service to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being extremely pleased with Rantideva, entrusted him with very confidential service.</p>
<p>The special power to render the most confidential service is entrusted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to a pure devotee, not to ordinary devotees.</p>
<p>Garga, the son of Bharadvaja, had a son named Sini, and Sini’s son was Gargya.</p>
<p>Although Gargya was a ksatriya by birth, his sons became brahmanas.</p>
<p>The son of Mahavirya was Duritaksaya, whose sons were of a ksatriya king, they also achieved the position of brahmanas.</p>
<p>The son of Brhatksatra constructed the city of Hastinapura and was known as Hasti.</p>
<p>His sons were Ajamidha, Dvimidha and Purumidha.</p>
<p>From Ajamidha came Priyamedha and other brahmanas and also a son named Brhadisu.</p>
<p>The sons, grandsons and further descendants of Brhadisu were Brhaddhanu, Brhatkaya, Jayadratha, Visada and Syenajit.</p>
<p>From Syenajit came four sons—Rucirasva, Drdhahanu, Kasya and Vatsa.</p>
<p>From Rucirasva came a son named Para, whose sons were Prthusena and Nipa, and from Nipa came one hundred sons.</p>
<p>Another son of Nipa was Brahmadatta.</p>
<p>From Brahmadatta came Visvaksena; from Visvaksena, Udaksena; and from Udaksena, Bhallata.</p>
<p>The son of Dvimidha was Yavinara, and from Yavinara came many sons and grandsons, such as Krtiman, Satyadhrti, Drdhanemi, Suparsva, Sumati, Sannatiman, Krti, Nipa, Udgrayudha, Ksemya, Suvira, Ripunjaya and Bahuratha.</p>
<p>Purumidha had no sons, but Ajamidha, in addition to his other sons, had a son named Nila, whose son was Santi.</p>
<p>The descendants of Santi were Susanti, Puruja, Arka and Bharmyasva.</p>
<p>Bharmyasva had five sons, one of whom, Mudgala, begot a dynasty of brahmanas.</p>
<p>Mudgala had twins—a son, Divodasa, and a daughter, Ahalya.</p>
<p>From Ahalya, by her husband, Gautama, Satananda was born.</p>
<p>The son of Satananda was Satyadhrti, and his son was Saradvan.</p>
<p>Saradvan’s son was known as Krpa, and Saradvan’s daughter, known as Krpi, became the wife of Dronacarya.</p>

<p>Indeed, he and his family members shivered for want of food and water, yet Rantideva always remained sober.</p>
<p>Once, after fasting for forty-eight days, in the morning Rantideva received some water and some foodstuffs made with milk and ghee, but when he and his family were about to eat, a brahmana guest arrived.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tasmai—unto him (the brahmana); samvyabhajat—after dividing, gave his share; sah—he (Rantideva); annam—the food; adrtya—with great respect; sraddhaya anvitah—and with faith; harim—the Supreme Lord; sarvatra—everywhere, or in the heart of every living being; sampasyan—conceiving; sah—he; bhuktva—after eating the food; prayayau—left that place; dvijah—the brahmana.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Godhead everywhere, and in every living entity, he received the guest with faith and respect and gave him a share of the food.</p>
<p>The brahmana guest ate his share and then went away.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Rantideva perceived the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being, but he never thought that because the Supreme Lord is present in every living being, every living being must be God.</p>
<p>Nor did he distinguish between one living being and another.</p>
<p>He perceived the presence of the Lord both in the brahmana and in the candala.</p>
<p>This is the true vision of equality, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (5.18):</p>
<p>vidya-vinaya-sampanne</p>
<p>brahmane gavi hastini</p>
<p>suni caiva sva-pake ca</p>
<p>panditah sama-darsinah</p>
<p>The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater (outcaste) A pandita, or learned person, perceives the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in every living being.</p>
<p>Therefore, although it has now become fashionable to give preference to the so-called daridra-narayana, or poor Narayana Rantideva had no reason to give preference to any one person.</p>
<p>The idea that because Narayana is present in the heart of one who is daridra, or poor, the poor man should be called daridra-narayana is a wrong conception.</p>
<p>By such logic, because the Lord is present within the hearts of the dogs and hogs, the dogs and hogs would also be Narayana.</p>
<p>One should not mistakenly think that Rantideva subscribed to this view.</p>
<p>Rather, he saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (hari-sambandhi-vastunah).</p>
<p>It is not that everyone is the Supreme Godhead.</p>
<p>Such a theory, which is propounded by the Mayavada philosophy, is always misleading, and Rantideva would never have accepted it.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, having divided the remaining food with his relatives, Rantideva was just about to eat his own share when a sudra guest arrived.</p>
<p>Seeing the sudra in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Rantideva gave him also a share of the food.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Because King Rantideva saw everyone as part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he never distinguished between the brahmana and the sudra, the poor and the rich.</p>
<p>Such equal vision is called sama-darsinah (panditah sama-darsinah (Bg.5.18)).</p>
<p>One who has actually realized that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated in everyone’s heart and that every living being is part of the Lord does not make any distinction between the brahmana and the sudra, the poor (daridra) and the rich (dhani).</p>
<p>Such a person sees all living beings equally and treats them equally, without discrimination.</p>

<p>King Rantideva had no ambition to enjoy material benefits from the demigods.</p>

<p>If one wants to become a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord, one should not hanker to take benedictions from the demigods.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.20), kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah: those befooled by the illusion of the material energy worship gods other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Rantideva was personally able to see Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, he did not hanker to take material benefits from them.</p>

<p>isvara-alambanam—completely taking shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord; cittam—his consciousness; kurvatah—fixing; ananya-radhasah—for Rantideva, who was undeviating and desired nothing other than to serve the Supreme Lord; maya—the illusory energy; guna-mayi—consisting of the three modes of nature; rajan—O Maharaja Pariksit; svapna-vat—like a dream; pratyaliyata—merged.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Maharaja Pariksit, because King Rantideva was a pure devotee, always Krsna conscious and free from all material desires, the Lord’s illusory energy, maya, could not exhibit herself before him.</p>
<p>On the contrary, for him maya entirely vanished, exactly like a dream.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As it is said:</p>
<p>krsna——surya-sama; maya haya andhakara</p>
<p>yahan krsna, tahan nahi mayara adhikara</p>
<p>Just as there is no chance that darkness can exist in the sunshine, in a pure Krsna conscious person there can be no existence of maya.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):</p>
<p>daivi hy esa guna-mayi</p>
<p>mama maya duratyaya</p>
<p>mam eva ye prapadyante</p>
<p>mayam etam taranti te</p>
<p>This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it If one wants to be free from the influence of maya, the illusory energy, one must become Krsna conscious and always keep Krsna prominent within the core of his heart.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (9.34) the Lord advises that one always think of Him (man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru).</p>
<p>In this way, by always being Krsna-minded or Krsna conscious, one can surpass the influence of maya (mayam etam taranti te (Bg.7.14)).</p>
<p>Because Rantideva was Krsna conscious, he was not under the influence of the illusory energy.</p>
<p>The word svapnavat is significant in this connection.</p>
<p>Because in the material world the mind is absorbed in materialistic activities, when one is asleep many contradictory activities appear in one’s dreams.</p>
<p>When one awakens, however, these activities automatically merge into the mind.</p>
<p>Similarly, as long as one is under the influence of the material energy he makes many plans and schemes, but when one is Krsna conscious such dreamlike plans automatically disappear.</p>

<p>All those who followed the principles of King Rantideva were totally favored by his mercy and became pure devotees, attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana.</p>
<p>Thus they all became the best of yogis.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The best yogis or mystics are the devotees, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):</p>

<p>sraddhavan bhajate yo mam</p>
<p>sa me yuktatamo matah</p>

<p>Because Rantideva was the king, the chief executive in the state, all the residents of the state became devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, by the king’s transcendental association.</p>
<p>This is the influence of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>If there is one pure devotee, his association can create hundreds and thousands of pure devotees.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has said that a Vaisnava is meritorious in proportion to the number of devotees he has created.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava becomes superior not simply by jugglery of words but by the number of devotees he has created for the Lord.</p>
<p>Here the word rantidevanuvartinah indicates that Rantideva’s officers, friends, relatives and subjects all became first-class Vaisnavas by his association.</p>
<p>In other words, Rantideva is confirmed herein to be a first-class devotee, or maha-bhagavata.</p>
<p>Mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh: (SB 5.5.2) one should render service to such mahatmas, for then one will automatically achieve the goal of liberation.</p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has also said, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: one cannot be liberated by his own effort, but if one becomes subordinate to a pure Vaisnava, the door to liberation is open.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse gives evidence confirming the statement of Bhagavad-gita that the orders of society—brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra—are calculated in terms of qualities and activities (guna-karma-vibhagasah).</p>
<p>All the descendants of Ajamidha, who was a ksatriya, became brahmanas.</p>
<p>This was certainly because of their qualities and activities.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes the sons of brahmanas or ksatriyas become vaisyas (brahmana-vaisyatam gatah).</p>
<p>When a ksatriya or brahmana adopts the occupation or duty of a vaisya (krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam (Bg.18.44)), he is certainly counted as a vaisya.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Nipa begot a son named Brahmadatta through the womb of his wife, Krtvi, who was the daughter of Suka.</p>
<p>And Brahmadatta, who was a great yogi, begot a son named Visvaksena through the womb of his wife, Sarasvati.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Suka mentioned here is different from the Sukadeva Gosvami who spoke Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami, the son of Vyasadeva, is described in great detail in the Brahma-vaivarta Purana.</p>
<p>There it is said that Vyasadeva maintained the daughter of Jabali as his wife and that after they performed penances together for many years, he placed his seed in her womb.</p>
<p>The child remained in the womb of his mother for twelve years, and when the father asked the son to come out, the son replied that he would not come out unless he were completely liberated from the influence of maya.</p>
<p>Vyasadeva then assured the child that he would not be influenced by maya, but the child did not believe his father, for the father was still attached to his wife and children.</p>
<p>Vyasadeva then went to Dvaraka and informed the Personality of Godhead about his problem, and the Personality of Godhead, at Vyasadeva’s request, went to Vyasadeva’s cottage, where He assured the child in the womb that he would not be influenced by maya.</p>
<p>Thus assured, the child came out, but he immediately went away as a parivrajakacarya.</p>
<p>When the father, very much aggrieved, began to follow his saintly boy, Sukadeva Gosvami, the boy created a duplicate Sukadeva, who later entered family life.</p>
<p>Therefore, the suka-kanya, or daughter of Sukadeva, mentioned in this verse is the daughter of the duplicate or imitation Sukadeva.</p>
<p>The original Sukadeva was a lifelong brahmacari.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-20" id="summary-20">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#922-1" id="922-1">9.22</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes the descendants of Divodasa.</p>
<p>It also describes Jarasandha, who belonged to the Rksa dynasty, as well as Duryodhana, Arjuna and others.</p>
<p>The son of Divodasa was Mitrayu, who had four sons, one after another—Cyavana, Sudasa, Sahadeva and Somaka.</p>
<p>Somaka had one hundred sons, of whom the youngest was Prsata, from whom Drupada was born.</p>
<p>Drupada’s daughter was Draupadi, and his sons were headed by Dhrstadyumna.</p>
<p>Dhrstadyumna’s son was Dhrstaketu.</p>
<p>Another son of Ajamidha was named Rksa.</p>
<p>From Rksa came a son named Samvarana, and from Samvarana came Kuru, the king of Kuruksetra.</p>
<p>Kuru had four sons—Pariksi, Sudhanu, Jahnu and Nisadha.</p>
<p>Among the descendants in the dynasty from Sudhanu were Suhotra, Cyavana, Krti and Uparicara Vasu.</p>
<p>The sons of Uparicara Vasu, including Brhadratha, Kusamba, Matsya, Pratyagra and Cedipa, became kings of the Cedi state.</p>
<p>In the dynasty from Brhadratha came Kusagra, Rsabha, Satyahita, Puspavan and Jahu, and from Brhadratha through the womb of another wife came Jarasandha, who was followed by Sahadeva, Somapi and Srutasrava.</p>
<p>Pariksi, the son of Kuru, had no sons.</p>
<p>Among the descendants of Jahnu were Suratha, Viduratha, Sarvabhauma, Jayasena, Radhika, Ayutayu, Akrodhana, Devatithi, Rksa, Dilipa and Pratipa.</p>
<p>The sons of Pratipa were Devapi, Santanu and Bahlika.</p>
<p>When Devapi retired to the forest, his younger brother Santanu became the king.</p>
<p>Although Santanu, being younger, was not eligible to occupy the throne, he disregarded his elder brother.</p>
<p>Consequently, there was no rainfall for twelve years.</p>
<p>Following the advice of the brahmanas, Santanu was ready to return the kingdom to Devapi, but by the intrigue of Santanu’s minister, Devapi became unfit to be king.</p>
<p>Therefore Santanu resumed charge of the kingdom, and rain fell properly during his regime.</p>
<p>By mystic power, Devapi still lives in the village known as Kalapa-grama.</p>
<p>In this Kali-yuga, when the descendants of Soma known as the candra-vamsa (the lunar dynasty) die out, Devapi, at the beginning of Satya-yuga, will reestablish the dynasty of the moon.</p>
<p>The wife of Santanu named Ganga gave birth to Bhisma, one of the twelve authorities.</p>
<p>Two sons named Citrangada and Vicitravirya were also born from the womb of Satyavati by the semen of Santanu, and Vyasadeva was born from Satyavati by the semen of Parasara, Vyasadeva instructed the history of the Bhagavatam to his son Sukadeva.</p>
<p>Through the womb of the two wives and the maidservant of Vicitravirya, Vyasadeva begot Dhrtarastra, Pandu and Vidura.</p>
<p>Dhrtarastra had one hundred sons, headed by Duryodhana, and one daughter named Duhsala.</p>
<p>Pandu had five sons, headed by Yudhisthira, and each of these five sons had one son from Draupadi.</p>
<p>The names of these sons of Draupadi were Prativindhya, Srutasena, Srutakirti, Satanika and Srutakarma.</p>
<p>Besides these five sons, by other wives the Pandavas had many other sons, such as Devaka, Ghatotkaca, Sarvagata, Suhotra, Naramitra, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu.</p>
<p>From Abhimanyu, Maharaja Pariksit was born, and Maharaja Pariksit had four sons—Janamejaya, Srutasena, Bhimasena and Ugrasena.</p>
<p>Next Sukadeva Gosvami described the future sons of the Pandu family.</p>
<p>From Janamejaya, he said, would come a son named Satanika, and following in the dynasty would be Sahasranika, Asvamedhaja, Asimakrsna, Nemicakra, Citraratha, Suciratha, Vrstiman, Susena, Sunitha, Nrcaksu, Sukhinala, Pariplava, Sunaya, Medhavi, Nrpanjaya, Durva, Timi, Brhadratha, Sudasa, Satanika, Durdamana, Mahinara, Dandapani, Nimi and Ksemaka.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami then predicted the kings of the magadha-vamsa, or Magadha dynasty.</p>
<p>Sahadeva, the son of Jarasandha, would beget Marjari, and from him would come Srutasrava.</p>
<p>Subsequently taking birth in the dynasty will be Yutayu, Niramitra, Sunaksatra, Brhatsena, Karmajit, Sutanjaya, Vipra, Suci, Ksema, Suvrata, Dharmasutra, Sama, Dyumatsena, Sumati, Subala, Sunitha, Satyajit, Visvajit and Ripunjaya.</p>

<p>When the brahmanas said this, Maharaja Santanu went to the forest and requested his elder brother Devapi to take charge of the kingdom, for it is the duty of a king to maintain his subjects.</p>

<p>The brahmanas deviated Devapi from the path of the Vedic principles, and therefore when asked by Santanu he did not agree to accept the post of ruler.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he blasphemed the Vedic principles and therefore became fallen.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is to be understood that Parvati is the daughter of the king of the very, very old mountainous country known as the Manipura state.</p>
<p>Five thousand years ago, therefore, when the Pandavas ruled, Manipura existed, as did its king.</p>
<p>Therefore this kingdom is a very old, aristocratic Vaisnava kingdom.</p>
<p>If this kingdom is organized as a Vaisnava state, this revitalization will be a great success because for five thousand years this state has maintained its identity.</p>
<p>If the Vaisnava spirit is revived there, it will be a wonderful place, renowned throughout the entire world.</p>
<p>Manipuri Vaisnavas are very famous in Vaisnava society.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana and Navadvipa there are many temples constructed by the king of Manipura.</p>
<p>Some of our devotees belong to the Manipura state.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement, therefore, can be well spread in the state of Manipura by the cooperative efforts of the Krsna conscious devotees.</p>

<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):</p>
<p>vadanti tat tattva-vidas</p>
<p>tattvam yaj jnanam advayam</p>
<p>brahmeti paramatmeti</p>
<p>bhagavan iti sabdyate</p>
<p>Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan The majority of transcendentalists understand only the impersonal Brahman or localized Paramatma, for the Personality of Godhead is very difficult to understand.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.3):</p>
<p>manusyanam sahasresu</p>
<p>kascid yatati siddhaye</p>
<p>yatatam api siddhanam</p>
<p>kascin mam vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.</p>
<p>The yogis and jnanis—that is, the mystic yogis and the impersonalists—can understand the Absolute Truth as impersonal or localized, but although such realized souls are above ordinary human beings, they cannot understand how the Supreme Absolute Truth can be a person.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said that out of many siddhas, the souls who have already realized the Absolute Truth, one may understand Krsna, who exactly resembles a human being (narakrti).</p>
<p>This human form was explained by Krsna Himself after He manifested the virat-rupa.</p>
<p>The virat-rupa is not the original form of the Lord; the Lord’s original form is Dvibhuja-syamasundara, Muralidhara, the Lord with two hands, playing a flute (yam syamasundaram acintya-guna-svarupam).</p>
<p>The Lord’s forms are proof of His inconceivable qualities.</p>
<p>Although the Lord maintains innumerable universes within the period of His breath, He is dressed with a form exactly like that of a human being.</p>
<p>That does not mean, however, that He is a human being.</p>
<p>This is His original form, but because He looks like a human being, those with a poor fund of knowledge consider Him an ordinary man.</p>
<p>The Lord says:</p>
<p>avajananti mam mudha</p>
<p>manusim tanum asritam</p>
<p>param bhavam ajananto</p>
<p>mama bhuta-mahesvaram</p>
<p>Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.</p>
<p>They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be (Bg.9.11) By the Lord’s param bhavam, or transcendental nature, He is the all-pervading Paramatma living in the core of the hearts of all living entities, yet He looks like a human being.</p>
<p>Mayavada philosophy says that the Lord is originally impersonal but assumes a human form and many other forms when He descends.</p>
<p>Actually, however, He is originally like a human being, and the impersonal Brahman consists of the rays of His body (yasya prabha prabhavato jagad-anda-koti (Bs.5.40)).</p>

<p>Long, long ago, Jyamagha had satisfied the demigods and Pitas by worshiping them.</p>
<p>Now, by their mercy, Jyamagha’s words came true.</p>
<p>Although Saibya was barren, by the grace of the demigods she became pregnant and in due course of time gave birth to a child named Vidarbha.</p>
<p>Before the child’s birth, the girl had been accepted as a daughter-in-law, and therefore Vidarbha actually married her when he grew up.</p>

<p>The five daughters of King Sura, named Prtha, Srutadeva, Srutakirti, Srutasrava and Rajadhidevi, were Vasudeva’s sisters.</p>
<p>Sura gave Prtha to his friend Kunti, who had no issue, and therefore another name of Prtha was Kunti.</p>

<p>According to Vedic civilization, if a girl gives birth to a child before she is married, no one will marry her.</p>

<p>The custom is that a girl should be married aksata-yoni, that is, with her virginity undisturbed.</p>
<p>A girl should never bear a child before her marriage.</p>

<p>Incarnations exhibit only a certain percentage of the potencies of Godhead; the complete Godhead is Krsna Himself, who appeared as the eighth son of Devaki.</p>

<p>At the present time, in Kali-yuga, people are extremely sinful and bad (manda).</p>
<p>They have no idea of spiritual life and are misusing the benefits of the human form to live like cats and dogs.</p>

<p>O King, Maharaja Pariksit, but for the Lord’s personal desire, there is no cause for His appearance, disappearance or activities.</p>
<p>As the Supersoul, He knows everything.</p>
<p>Consequently there is no cause that affects Him, not even the results of fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse points out the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being.</p>
<p>An ordinary living being receives a particular type of body according to his past activities (karmana daiva-netrena jantur dehopapattaye (SB 3.31.1)).</p>
<p>A living being is never independent and can never appear independently.</p>
<p>Rather, one is forced to accept a body imposed upon him by maya according to his past karma.</p>
<p>As explained in Bhagavad-gita (18.61), yantrarudhani mayaya.</p>
<p>The body is a kind of machine created and offered to the living entity by the material energy under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the living entity must accept a particular type of body awarded to him by maya, the material energy, according to his karma.</p>
<p>One cannot independently say, Give me a body like thi or Give me a body like that One must accept whatever body is offered by the material energy.</p>
<p>This is the position of the ordinary living being.</p>
<p>When Krsna descends, however, He does so out of His merciful compassion for the fallen souls.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.8):</p>
<p>paritranaya sadhunam</p>
<p>vinasaya ca duskrtam</p>
<p>dharma-samsthapanarthaya</p>
<p>sambhavami yuge yuge</p>
<p>To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium The Supreme Lord is not forced to appear.</p>
<p>Indeed, no one can subject Him to force, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Everyone is under His control, and He is not under the control of anyone else.</p>
<p>Foolish people who because of a poor fund of knowledge think that one can equal Krsna or become Krsna are condemned in every way.</p>
<p>No one can equal or surpass Krsna, who is therefore described as asamaurdhva.</p>
<p>According to the Visva-kosa dictionary, the word maya is used in the sense of false prid and also in the sense of compassion For an ordinary living being, the body in which he appears is his punishment.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14), daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya: This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome But when Krsna comes the word maya refers to His compassion or mercy upon the devotees and fallen souls.</p>
<p>By His potency, the Lord can deliver everyone, whether sinful or pious.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yat—whatever; maya-cestitam—the laws of material nature enacted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead; pumsah—of the living entities; sthiti—duration of life; utpatti—birth; apyayaya—annihilation; hi—indeed; anugrahah—compassion; tat-nivrtteh—the creation and manifestation of cosmic energy to stop the repetition of birth and death; atma-labhaya—thus going home, back to Godhead; ca—indeed; isyate—for this purpose the creation is there.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead acts through His material energy in the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation just to deliver the living entity by His compassion and stop the living entity’s birth, death and duration of materialistic life.</p>
<p>Thus He enables the living being to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Materialistic men sometimes ask why God has created the material world for the suffering of the living entities.</p>
<p>The material creation is certainly meant for the suffering of the conditioned souls, who are part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (15.7):</p>
<p>mamaivamso jiva-loke</p>
<p>jiva-bhutah sanatanah</p>
<p>manah sasthanindriyani</p>
<p>prakrti-sthani karsati</p>
<p>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.</p>
<p>Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind All the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and are as good as the Lord qualitatively, but quantitatively there is a great difference between them, for the Lord is unlimited whereas the living entities are limited.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord possesses unlimited potency for pleasure, and the living entities have a limited pleasure potency.</p>
<p>Anandamayo ’bhyasat (Vedanta-sutra1.1.12).</p>
<p>Both the Lord and the living entity, being qualitatively spirit soul, have the tendency for peaceful enjoyment, but when the part of the Supreme Personality of Godhead unfortunately wants to enjoy independently, without Krsna, he is put into the material world, where he begins his life as Brahma and is gradually degraded to the status of an ant or a worm in stool.</p>
<p>This is called manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati (Bg.15.7).</p>
<p>There is a great struggle for existence because the living entity conditioned by material nature is under nature’s full control (prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Because of his limited knowledge, however, the living entity thinks he is enjoying in this material world.</p>
<p>Manah sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati (Bg.15.7).</p>
<p>He is actually under the full control of material nature, but still he thinks himself independent (ahankara-vimudhatma kartaham iti manyate (Bg.3.27)).</p>
<p>Even when he is elevated by speculative knowledge and tries to merge into the existence of Brahman, the same disease continues.</p>
<p>Aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah patanty adhah (Bhag.10.2.32).</p>
<p>Even having attained that param padam, having merged into the impersonal Brahman, he falls again to the material world.</p>
<p>In this way, the conditioned soul undergoes a great struggle for existence in this material world, and therefore the Lord, out of compassion for him, appears in this world and instructs him.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.7):</p>
<p>yada yada hi dharmasya</p>
<p>glanir bhavati bharata</p>
<p>abhyutthanam adharmasya</p>
<p>tadatmanam srjamy aham</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself The real dharma is to surrender unto Krsna, but the rebellious living entity, instead of surrendering to Krsna, engages in adharma, in a struggle for existence to become like Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore out of compassion Krsna creates this material world to give the living entity a chance to understand his real position.Bhagavad-gita and similar Vedic literatures are presented so that the living being may understand his relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>Vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15).</p>
<p>All these Vedic literatures are meant to enable the human being to understand what he is, what his actual position is, and what his relationship is with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is called brahma-jijnasa.</p>
<p>Every conditioned soul is struggling, but human life provides the best chance for him to understand his position.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse says, anugrahas tan-nivrtteh, indicating that the false life of repeated birth and death must be stopped and the conditioned soul should be educated.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of the creation.</p>
<p>The creation does not arise whimsically, as atheistic men think asatyam apratistham te</p>
<p>jagad ahur anisvaram</p>
<p>aparaspara-sambhutam</p>
<p>kim anyat kama-haitukam</p>
<p>They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control.</p>
<p>It is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust (Bg.16.8) Atheistic rascals think that there is no God and that the creation has taken place by chance, just as a man and woman meet by chance and the woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a child.</p>
<p>Actually, however, this is not the fact.</p>
<p>The fact is that there is a purpose for this creation: to give the conditioned soul a chance to return to his original consciousness, Krsna consciousness, and then return home, back to Godhead, and be completely happy in the spiritual world.</p>
<p>In the material world the conditioned soul is given a chance to satisfy his senses, but at the same time he is informed by Vedic knowledge that this material world is not his actual place for happiness.</p>
<p>Janma-mrtyu-jara-vyadhi-duhkha-dosanudarsanam (Bg.13.9).</p>
<p>One must stop the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>Every human being, therefore, should take advantage of this creation by understanding Krsna and his relationship with Krsna and in this way return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>aksauhininam—of kings possessing great military power; patibhih—by such kings or government; asuraih—actually demons (because they do not need such military power but create it unnecessarily); nrpa-lanchanaih—who are actually unfit to be kings (although they have somehow taken possession of the government); bhuvah—on the surface of the earth; akramyamanayah—aiming at attacking one another; abharaya—paving the way for diminishing the number of demons on the surface of the earth; krta-udyamah—enthusiastic (they spend all the revenue of the state to increase military power).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although the demons who take possession of the government are dressed like men of government, they do not know the duty of the government.</p>
<p>Consequently, by the arrangement of God, such demons, who possess great military strength, fight with one another, and thus the great burden of demons on the surface of the earth is reduced.</p>
<p>The demons increase their military power by the will of the Supreme, so that their numbers will be diminished and the devotees will have a chance to advance in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam.</p>
<p>The sadhus, the devotees of the Lord, are always eager to advance the cause of Krsna consciousness so that the conditioned souls may be released from the bondage of birth and death.</p>
<p>But the asuras, the demons, impede the advancement of the Krsna consciousness movement, and therefore Krsna arranges occasional fights between different asuras who are very much interested in increasing their military power.</p>
<p>The duty of the government or king is not to increase military power unnecessarily; the real duty of the government is to see that the people of the state advance in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.13), catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah: According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me There should be an ideal class of men who are bona fide brahmanas, and they should be given all protection.</p>
<p>Namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca.</p>
<p>Krsna is very fond of brahmanas and cows, The brahmanas promulgate the cause of advancement in Krsna consciousness, and the cows give enough milk to maintain the body in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>The ksatriyas and the government should be advised by the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Next, the vaisyas should produce enough foodstuffs, and the sudras, who cannot do anything beneficial on their own, should serve the three higher classes (the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas).</p>
<p>This is the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that the conditioned souls will be released from the material condition and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the purpose of Krsna’s descent on the surface of the earth (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)).</p>
<p>Everyone must understand Krsna’s activities (janma karma ca me divyam (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>If one understands the purpose of Krsna’s coming to this earth and performing His activities, one is immediately liberated.</p>
<p>This liberation is the purpose of the creation and Krsna’s descent upon the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Demons are very much interested in advancing a plan by which people will labor hard like cats, dogs and hogs, but Krsna’s devotees want to teach Krsna consciousness so that people will be satisfied with plain living and Krsna conscious advancement.</p>
<p>Although demons have created many plans for industry and hard labor so that people will work day and night like animals, this is not the purpose of civilization.</p>
<p>Such endeavors are jagato’hitah; that is, they are meant for the misfortune of the people in general.</p>
<p>Ksayaya: such activities lead to annihilation.</p>
<p>One who understands the purpose of Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, should seriously understand the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement and seriously take part in it.</p>
<p>One should not endeavor for ugra-karma, or unnecessary work for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti (Bhag.5.5.4).</p>
<p>Simply for sense gratification, people make plans for material happiness.</p>
<p>Maya-sukhaya bharam udvahato vimudhan (Bhag.7.9.43).</p>
<p>They do this because they are all vimudhas, rascals.</p>
<p>For flickering happiness, people waste their human energy, not understanding the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement but instead accusing the simple devotees of brainwashing.</p>
<p>Demons may falsely accuse the preachers of the Krsna consciousness movement, but Krsna will arrange a fight between the demons in which all their military power will be engaged and both parties of demons will be annihilated.</p>

<p>To show causeless mercy to the devotees who would take birth in the future in this age of Kali, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, acted in such a way that simply by remembering Him one will be freed from all the lamentation and unhappiness of material existence (In other words, He acted so that all future devotees, by accepting the instructions of Krsna consciousness stated in Bhagavad-gita, could be relieved from the pangs of material existence.)</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Simply by receiving the glories of the Lord through purified transcendental ears, the devotees of the Lord are immediately freed from strong material desires and engagement in fruitive activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When the devotees aurally receive the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as enacted in Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, they immediately achieve a transcendental vision in which they are no longer interested in materialistic activities.</p>
<p>Thus they achieve freedom from the material world.</p>
<p>For sense gratification practically everyone is engaged in materialistic activities, which prolong the process of janma-mrtyu jara-vyadhi—birth, death, old age and disease—but the devotee, simply by hearing the message of Bhagavad-gita and further relishing the narrations of Srimad-Bhagavatam, becomes so pure that he no longer takes interest in materialistic activities.</p>
<p>At the moment, devotees in the Western countries are being attracted by Krsna consciousness and becoming uninterested in materialistic activities, and therefore people are trying to oppose this movement.</p>
<p>But they cannot possibly check this movement or stop the activities of the devotees in Europe and America by their artificial impositions.</p>
<p>Here the words srotranjalir upasprsya indicate that simply by hearing the transcendental activities of the Lord the devotees become so pure that they are immediately immune to the contamination of materialistic fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11) Materialistic activities are unnecessary for the soul, and therefore the devotees are freed from such activities.</p>
<p>The devotees are situated in liberation (brahma-bhuyaya kalpate), and therefore they cannot be called back to their material homes and materialistic activities.</p>

<p>yatatam api siddhanam</p>
<p>kascin mam vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth Unless one is qualified to understand Krsna, one cannot appreciate the presence of Krsna on earth.</p>
<p>Among the Bhojas, Vrsnis, Andhakas, Pandavas and many other kings intimately related with Krsna, the intimate relationship between Krsna and the inhabitants of Vrndavana is especially to be noted.</p>
<p>That relationship is described in this verse by the words nityotsavam na tatrpur drsibhih pibantyah.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Vrndavana especially, such as the cowherd boys, the cows, the calves, the gopis and Krsna’s father and mother, were never fully satisfied, although they saw Krsna’s beautiful features constantly.</p>
<p>Seeing Krsna is described here as nitya-utsava, a daily festival.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Vrndavana saw Krsna almost every moment, but when Krsna left the village for the pasturing grounds, where He tended the cows and calves, the gopis were very much afflicted because they saw Krsna walking on the sand and thought that Krsna’s lotus feet, which they dared not place on their breasts because they thought their breasts not soft enough, were being pierced by broken chips of stone.</p>
<p>By even thinking of this, the gopis were affected, and they cried at home.</p>
<p>These gopis, who were therefore the exalted friends of Krsna, saw Krsna constantly, but because their eyelids disturbed their vision of Krsna, the gopis condemned the creator, Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Therefore the beauty of Krsna, especially the beauty of His face, is described here.</p>
<p>At the end of the Ninth Canto, in the Twenty-fourth Chapter, we find a hint of Krsna’s beauty.</p>
<p>Now we are proceeding to the Tenth Canto, which is considered Krsna’s head.</p>
<p>The entire Srimad-Bhagavata Purana is the embodiment of Krsna’s form, and the Tenth Canto is His face.</p>
<p>This verse gives a hint of how beautiful His face is.</p>
<p>Krsna’s smiling face, with His cheeks, His lips, the ornaments in His ears, His chewing of betel nuts—all this was minutely observed by the gopis, who thus enjoyed transcendental bliss, so much so that they were never fully satisfied to see Krsna’s face, but instead condemned the creator of the body for making eyelids that obstructed their vision.</p>
<p>The beauty of Krsna’s face was therefore much more appreciated by the gopis than by His friends the cowherd boys or even by Yasoda Mata, who was also interested in decorating the face of Krsna.</p>

<p>jatah—after taking birth as the son of Vasudeva; gatah—went away; pitr-grhat—from the houses of His father; vrajam—to Vrndavana; edhita-arthah—to exalt the position (of Vrndavana); hatva—killing there; ripun—many demons; suta-satani—hundreds of sons; krta-urudarah—accepting many thousands of wives, the best of women; utpadya—begot; tesu—in them; purusah—the Supreme Person, who exactly resembles a human being; kratubhih—by many sacrifices; samije—worshiped; atmanam—Himself (because He is the person worshiped by all sacrifices); atma-nigamam—exactly according to the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas; prathayan—expanding the Vedic principles; janesu—among the people in general.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, known as lila-purusottama, appeared as the son of Vasudeva but immediately left His father’s home and went to Vrndavana to expand His loving relationship with His confidential devotees.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana the Lord killed many demons, and afterwards He returned to Dvaraka, where according to Vedic principles He married many wives who were the best of women, begot through them hundreds of sons, and performed sacrifices for His own worship to establish the principles of householder life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: by all the Vedas, it is Krsna who is to be known.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna, setting an example by His own behavior, performed many ritualistic ceremonies described in the Vedas and established the principles of grhastha life by marrying many wives and begetting many children just to show people in general how to be happy by living according to Vedic principles.</p>
<p>The center of Vedic sacrifice is Krsna (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>To advance in human life, human society must follow the Vedic principles personally demonstrated by Lord Krsna in His householder life.</p>
<p>The real purpose of Krsna’s appearance, however, was to manifest how one can take part in loving affairs with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Reciprocations of loving affairs in ecstasy are possible only in Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Therefore just after His appearance as the son of Vasudeva, the Lord immediately left for Vrndavana.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana, the Lord not only took part in loving affairs with His father and mother, the gopis and the cowherd boys, but also gave liberation to many demons by killing them.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.8), paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam: the Lord appears in order to protect the devotees and kill the demons.</p>
<p>This was fully exhibited by His personal behavior.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord is understood by Arjuna to be purusam sasvatam divyam—the eternal, transcendental Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Here also we find the words utpadya tesu purusah.</p>
<p>Therefore it is to be concluded that the Absolute Truth is purusa, a person.</p>
<p>The impersonal feature is but one of the features of His personality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, He is a person; He is not impersonal.</p>
<p>And not only is He purusa, a person, but He is the lila-purusottama, the best of all persons.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, Lord Sri Krsna created a misunderstanding between family members just to diminish the burden of the world.</p>
<p>Simply by His glance, He annihilated all the demoniac kings on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra and declared victory for Arjuna.</p>
<p>Finally, He instructed Uddhava about transcendental life and devotion and then returned to His abode in His original form.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)</p>
<p>The mission of Lord Krsna was performed on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra, for by the Lord’s mercy Arjuna was victorious due to being a great devotee whereas the others were killed simply by the Lord’s glance, which cleansed them of all sinful activities and enabled them to attain sarupya.</p>
<p>Finally, Lord Krsna instructed Uddhava about the transcendental life of devotional service, and then, in due course of time, He returned to His abode.</p>
<p>The Lord’s instructions in the form of Bhagavad-gita are full of jnana and vairagya, knowledge and renunciation.</p>
<p>In the human form of life, one must learn these two things—how to become detached from the material world and how to acquire full knowledge in spiritual life.</p>
<p>This is the Lord’s mission (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)).</p>
<p>After executing His complete mission, the Lord returned to His home, Goloka Vrndavana.</p>
