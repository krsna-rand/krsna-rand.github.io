<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#61" id="61">6.1</a></h3>
<p>Throughout Srimad-Bhagavatam there are descriptions of ten subject matters, including creation, subsequent creation and the planetary systems.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami, the speaker of Srimad-Bhagavatam, has already described creation, subsequent creation and the planetary systems in the Third, Fourth and Fifth Cantos.</p>
<p>Now, in this Sixth Canto, which consists of nineteen chapters, he will describe posana, or protection by the Lord.</p>
<p>The first chapter relates the history of Ajamila, who was considered a greatly sinful man, but was liberated when four order carriers of Visnu came to rescue him from the hands of the order carriers of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>A full description of how he was liberated, having been relieved of the reactions of his sinful life, is given in this chapter.</p>
<p>Sinful activities are painful both in this life and in the next.</p>
<p>We should know for certain that the cause of all painful life is sinful action.</p>
<p>On the path of fruitive work one certainly commits sinful activities, and therefore according to the considerations of karma-kanda, different types of atonement are recommended.</p>
<p>Such methods of atonement, however, do not free one from ignorance, which is the root of sinful life.</p>
<p>Consequently one is prone to commit sinful activities even after atonement, which is therefore very inadequate for purification.</p>
<p>On the path of speculative knowledge one becomes free from sinful life by understanding things as they are.</p>
<p>Therefore the acquirement of speculative knowledge is also considered a method of atonement.</p>
<p>While performing fruitive activities one can become free from the actions of sinful life through austerity, penance, celibacy, control of the mind and senses, truthfulness and the practice of mystic yoga.</p>
<p>By awakening knowledge one may also neutralize sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Neither of these methods, however, can free one from the tendency to commit sinful activities.</p>
<p>By bhakti-yoga one can completely avoid the tendency for sinful life; other methods are not very feasible.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic literature concludes that devotional service is more important than the methods of karma-kanda and jnana-kanda.</p>
<p>Only the path of devotional service is auspicious for everyone.</p>
<p>Fruitive activities and speculative knowledge cannot independently liberate anyone, but devotional service, independent of karma and jnana, is so potent that one who has fixed his mind at the lotus feet of Krsna is guaranteed not to meet the Yamadutas, the order carriers of Yamaraja, even in dreams.</p>
<p>To prove the strength of devotional service, Sukadeva Gosvami described the history of Ajamila.</p>
<p>Ajamila was a resident of Kanyakubja (the modern Kanauj).</p>
<p>He was trained by his parents to become a perfect brahmana by studying the Vedas and following the regulative principles, but because of his past, this youthful brahmana was somehow attracted by a prostitute, and because of her association he became most fallen and abandoned all regulative principles.</p>
<p>Ajamila begot in the womb of the prostitute ten sons, the last of whom was called Narayana.</p>
<p>At the time of Ajamila’s death, when the order carriers of Yamaraja came to take him, he loudly called the name Narayana in fear because he was attached to his youngest son.</p>
<p>Thus he remembered the original Narayana, Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Although he did not chant the holy name of Narayana completely offenselessly, it acted nevertheless.</p>
<p>As soon as he chanted the holy name of Narayana, the order carriers of Lord Visnu immediately appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>A discussion ensued between the order carriers of Lord Visnu and those of Yamaraja, and by hearing that discussion Ajamila was liberated.</p>
<p>He could then understand the bad effect of fruitive activities and could also understand how exalted is the process of devotional service.</p>

<p>sri-pariksid uvaca</p>
<p>nivrtti-margah kathita</p>
<p>adau bhagavata yatha</p>
<p>krama-yogopalabdhena</p>
<p>brahmana yad asamsrtih</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sri-pariksit uvaca—Maharaja Pariksit said; nivrtti-margah—the path of liberation; kathitah—described; adau—in the beginning; bhagavata—by Your Holiness; yatha—duly; krama—gradually; yoga-upalabdhena—obtained by the yoga process; brahmana—along with Lord Brahma (after reaching Brahmaloka); yat—by which way; asamsrtih—cessation of the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit said: O my lord, O Sukadeva Gosvami, you have already described (in the Second Canto) the path of liberation (nivrtti-marga).</p>
<p>By following that path, one is certainly elevated gradually to the highest planetary system, Brahmaloka, from which one is promoted to the spiritual world along with Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Thus one’s repetition of birth and death in the material world ceases.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Maharaja Pariksit was a Vaisnava, when he heard the description, at the end of the Fifth Canto, of the different hellish conditions of life, he was very much concerned with how to liberate the conditioned souls from the clutches of maya and take them back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore he reminded his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, about the nivrtti-marga, or path of liberation, which he had described in the Second Canto.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit, who at the time of death was fortunate to have met Sukadeva Gosvami, inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation at that crucial time.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated his question and congratulated him by saying:</p>
<p>variyan esa te prasnah</p>
<p>krto loka-hitam nrpa</p>
<p>atmavit-sammatah pumsam</p>
<p>srotavyadisu yah parah</p>
<p>My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial for all kinds of people.</p>
<p>The answer to this question is the prime subject matter for hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists (Bhag.2.1.1) Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that the living entities in the conditional stage do not accept the path of liberation, devotional service, instead of suffering in so many hellish conditions.</p>
<p>This is the symptom of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Vancha-kalpa-tarubhyas ca krpa-sindhubhya eva ca: a Vaisnava is an ocean of mercy.</p>
<p>Para-duhkha-duhkhi: he is unhappy because of the unhappiness of others.</p>
<p>Therefore Pariksit Maharaja, being compassionate toward the conditioned souls suffering in hellish life, suggested that Sukadeva Gosvami continue describing the path of liberation, which he had explained in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>The word asamsrti is very important in this connection.</p>
<p>Samsrti refers to continuing on the path of birth and death.</p>
<p>Asamsrti, on the contrary, refers to nivrtti-marga, or the path of liberation, by which one’s birth and death cease and one gradually progresses to Brahmaloka, unless one is a pure devotee who does not care about going to the higher planetary systems, in which case one immediately returns home, back to Godhead, by executing devotional service (tyaktva deham punar janma naiti (Bg.4.9)).</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, was very eager to hear from Sukadeva Gosvami about the path of liberation for the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the acaryas, the word krama-yogopalabdhena indicates that by first performing karma-yoga and then jnana-yoga and finally coming to the platform of bhakti-yoga, one can be liberated.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga, however, is so powerful that it does not depend on karma-yoga or jnana-yoga.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga itself is so powerful that even an impious man with no assets in karma-yoga or an illiterate with no assets in jnana-yoga can undoubtedly be elevated to the spiritual world if he simply adheres to bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Mam evaisyasy asamsayah.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (8.7) that by the process of bhakti-yoga one undoubtedly goes back to Godhead, back home to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Yogis, however, instead of going directly to the spiritual world, sometimes want to see other planetary systems, and therefore they ascend to the planetary system where Lord Brahma lives, as indicated here by the word brahmana.</p>
<p>At the time of dissolution, Lord Brahma, along with all the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, goes directly to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Vedas as follows:</p>
<p>brahmana saha te sarve</p>
<p>samprapte pratisancare</p>
<p>parasyante krtatmanah</p>
<p>pravisanti param padam</p>
<p>Because of their exalted position, those who are on Brahmaloka at the time of dissolution go directly back home, back to Godhead, along with Lord Brahma</p>

<p>traigunya-visayo mune</p>
<p>yo ’sav alina-prakrter</p>
<p>guna-sargah punah punah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>pravrtti—by inclination; laksanah—symptomized; ca—also; eva—indeed; trai-gunya—the three modes of nature; visayah—possessing as objectives; mune—O great sage; yah—which; asau—that; alina-prakrteh—of one who is not freed from the clutches of maya; guna-sargah—in which there is a creation of material bodies; punah punah—again and again.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O great sage Sukadeva Gosvami, unless the living entity is freed from the infection of the material modes of nature, he receives different types of bodies in which to enjoy or suffer, and according to the body, he is understood to have various inclinations.</p>
<p>By following these inclinations he traverses the path called pravrtti-marga, by which one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, as you have already described (in the Third Canto).</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As Lord Krsna explains in Bhagavad-gita (9.25):</p>
<p>yanti deva-vrata devan</p>
<p>pitrn yanti pitr-vratah</p>
<p>bhutani yanti bhutejya</p>
<p>yanti mad-yajino ’pi mam</p>
<p>Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; and those who worship Me will live with Me.</p>
<p>Because of the influence of the various modes of nature, the living entities have various tendencies or propensities, and therefore they are qualified to achieve various destinations.</p>
<p>As long as one is materially attached, he wants to be elevated to the heavenly planets because of his attraction to the material world.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares, however, Those who worship Me come to Me If one has no information about the Supreme Lord and His abode, one tries to be elevated only to a higher material position, but when one concludes that in this material world there is nothing but repeated birth and death, he tries to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>If one attains that destination, he need never return to this material world (yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama (Bg.15.6)).</p>
<p>As Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya19.151):</p>
<p>brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva</p>
<p>guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija</p>
<p>According to their karma, all living entities are wandering throughout the entire universe.</p>
<p>Some of them are being elevated to the upper planetary systems, and some are going down into the lower planetary systems.</p>
<p>Out of many millions of wandering living entities, one who is very fortunate gets an opportunity to associate with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Krsna.</p>
<p>By the mercy of both Krsna and the spiritual master, such a person receives the seed of the creeper of devotional service All living entities are rotating throughout the universe, going sometimes up to the higher planetary systems and sometimes down to the lower planets.</p>
<p>This is the material disease, which is known as pravrtti-marga.</p>
<p>When one becomes intelligent he takes to nivrtti-marga, the path of liberation, and thus instead of rotating within this material world, he returns home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear lord, you have described the dynasties and characteristics of King Priyavrata and King Uttanapada.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead created this material world with various universes, planetary systems, planets and stars, with varied lands, seas, oceans, mountains, rivers, gardens and trees, all with different characteristics.</p>
<p>These are divided among this planet earth, the luminaries in the sky and the lower planetary systems.</p>
<p>You have very clearly described these planets and the living entities who live on them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the words yathedam asrjad vibhuh clearly indicate that the Supreme, the great, almighty Personality of Godhead, created this entire material world with its different varieties of planets, stars and so forth.</p>
<p>Atheists try to conceal the hand of God, which is present in every creation, but they cannot explain how all these creations could come into existence without a competent intelligence and almighty power behind them.</p>
<p>Simply to imagine or speculate is a waste of time.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (10.8), the Lord says, aham sarvasya prabhavo: I am the origin of everything Mattah sarvam pravartate: whatever exists in the creation emanates from Me Iti matva bhajante mam budha bhava-samanvitah: When one fully understands that I create everything by My omnipotence, one becomes firmly situated in devotional service and fully surrenders at My lotus feet Unfortunately, the unintelligent cannot immediately understand Krsna’s supremacy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if they associate with devotees and read authorized books, they may gradually come to the proper understanding, although this may take many, many births.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.19):</p>
<p>bahunam janmanam ante</p>
<p>jnanavan mam prapadyate</p>
<p>vasudevah sarvam iti</p>
<p>sa mahatma sudurlabhah</p>
<p>After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is.</p>
<p>Such a great soul is very rare Vasudeva, Krsna, is the creator of everything, and His energy is displayed in various ways.</p>
<p>As explained in Bhagavad-gita (7.4–5), a combination of the material energy (bhumir apo ’nalo vayuh) and the spiritual energy, the living entity, exists in every creation.</p>
<p>Therefore the same principle, the combination of the supreme spirit and the material elements, is the cause of the cosmic manifestation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O greatly fortunate and opulent Sukadeva Gosvami, now kindly tell me how human beings may be saved from having to enter hellish conditions in which they suffer terrible pains.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Twenty-sixth Chapter of the Fifth Canto, Sukadeva Gosvami has explained that people who commit sinful acts are forced to enter hellish planets and suffer.</p>
<p>Now Maharaja Pariksit, being a devotee, is concerned with how this can be stopped.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; in other words, he has no personal troubles, but he is very unhappy to see others in trouble.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja said, My Lord, I have no personal problems, for I have learned how to glorify Your transcendental qualities and thus enter a trance of ecstasy.</p>
<p>I do have a problem, however, for I am simply thinking of these rascals and fools who are busy with maya-sukha, temporary happiness, without knowledge of devotional service unto You This is the problem faced by a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Because a Vaisnava fully takes shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he personally has no problems, but because he is compassionate toward the fallen, conditioned souls, he is always thinking of plans to save them from their hellish life in this body and the next.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja, therefore, anxiously wanted to know from Sukadeva Gosvami how humanity can be saved from gliding down to hell.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami had already explained how people enter hellish life, and he could also explain how they could be saved from it.</p>
<p>Intelligent men must take advantage of these instructions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the entire world is lacking Krsna consciousness, and therefore people are suffering from the grossest ignorance and do not even believe in a life after this one.</p>
<p>To convince them of their next life is very difficult because they have become almost mad in their pursuit of material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our duty, the duty of all sane men, is to save them.</p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit is the representative of one who can save them.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami replied: My dear King, if before one’s next death whatever impious acts one has performed in this life with his mind, words and body are not counteracted through proper atonement according to the description of the Manu-samhita and other dharma-sastras, one will certainly enter the hellish planets after death and undergo terrible suffering, as I have previously described to you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura mentions that although Maharaja Pariksit was a pure devotee, Sukadeva Gosvami did not immediately speak to him about the strength of devotional service.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):</p>
<p>mam ca yo ’vyabhicarena</p>
<p>bhakti-yogena sevate</p>
<p>sa gunan samatityaitan</p>
<p>brahma-bhuyaya kalpate</p>
<p>Devotional service is so strong that if one fully surrenders to Krsna and takes fully to His devotional service, the reactions of his sinful life immediately stop.</p>
<p>Gita (18.66), Lord Krsna urges that one give up all other duties and surrender to Him, and He promises, aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami: I shall free you from all sinful reactions and give you liberation Therefore in response to the inquiries of Pariksit Maharaja, Sukadeva Gosvami, his guru, could have immediately explained the principle of bhakti, but to test Pariksit Maharaja’s intelligence, he first prescribed atonement according to karma-kanda, the path of fruitive activities.</p>
<p>For karma-kanda there are eighty authorized scriptures, such as Manu-samhita, which are known as dharma-sastras.</p>
<p>In these scriptures one is advised to counteract his sinful acts by performing other types of fruitive action.</p>
<p>This was the path first recommended by Sukadeva Gosvami to Maharaja Pariksit, and actually it is a fact that one who does not take to devotional service must follow the decision of these scriptures by performing pious acts to counteract his impious acts.</p>
<p>This is known as atonement.</p>

<p>tasmat—therefore; pura—before; eva—indeed; asu—very quickly; iha—in this life; papa-niskrtau—to become free from the reaction of sinful activities; yateta—one should endeavor; mrtyoh—death; avipadyata—not troubled by disease and old age; atmana—with a body; dosasya—of the sinful activities; drstva—estimating; guru-laghavam—the heaviness or lightness; yatha—just like; bhisak—a physician; cikitseta—would treat; rujam—of disease; nidana-vit—one who is expert in diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, before one’s next death comes, as long as one’s body is strong enough, one should quickly adopt the process of atonement according to sastra; otherwise one’s time will be lost, and the reactions of his sins will increase.</p>
<p>As an expert physician diagnoses and treats a disease according to its gravity, one should undergo atonement according to the severity of one’s sins.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The dharma-sastras like the Manu-samhita prescribe that a man who has committed murder should be hanged and his own life sacrificed in atonement.</p>
<p>Previously this system was followed all over the world, but since people are becoming atheists, they are stopping capital punishment.</p>
<p>This is not wise.</p>
<p>Herein it is said that a physician who knows how to diagnose a disease prescribes medicine accordingly.</p>
<p>If the disease is very serious, the medicine must be strong.</p>
<p>The weight of a murderer’s sin is very great, and therefore according to Manu-samhita a murderer must be killed.</p>
<p>By killing a murderer the government shows mercy to him because if a murderer is not killed in this life, he will be killed and forced to suffer many times in future lives.</p>
<p>Since people do not know about the next life and the intricate workings of nature, they manufacture their own laws, but they should properly consult the established injunctions of the sastras and act accordingly.</p>
<p>In India even today the Hindu community often takes advice from expert scholars regarding how to counteract sinful activities.</p>
<p>In Christianity also there is a process of confession and atonement.</p>
<p>Therefore atonement is required, and atonement must be undergone according to the gravity of one’s sinful acts.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit said: One may know that sinful activity is injurious for him because he actually sees that a criminal is punished by the government and rebuked by people in general and because he hears from scriptures and learned scholars that one is thrown into hellish conditions in the next life for committing sinful acts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of such knowledge, one is forced to commit sins again and again, even after performing acts of atonement.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is the value of such atonement?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In some religious sects a sinful man goes to a priest to confess his sinful acts and pay a fine, but then he again commits the same sins and returns to confess them again.</p>
<p>This is the practice of a professional sinner.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja’s observations indicate that even five thousand years ago it was the practice of criminals to atone for their crimes but then commit the same crimes again, as if forced to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, owing to his practical experience, Pariksit Maharaja saw that the process of repeatedly sinning and atoning is pointless.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many times he is punished, one who is attached to sense enjoyment will commit sinful acts again and again until he is trained to refrain from enjoying his senses.</p>
<p>The word vivasa is used herein, indicating that even one who does not want to commit sinful acts will be forced to do so by habit.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja therefore considered the process of atonement to have little value for saving one from sinful acts.</p>
<p>In the following verse he further explains his rejection of this process.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Pariksit Maharaja inquired how a human being could free himself from sinful activities so as not to be forced to go to hellish planetary systems after death, Sukadeva Gosvami answered that the process of counteracting sinful life is atonement.</p>
<p>In this way Sukadeva Gosvami tested the intelligence of Maharaja Pariksit, who passed the examination by refusing to accept this process as genuine.</p>
<p>Now Pariksit Maharaja is expecting another answer from his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami, the son of Vedavyasa, answered: My dear King, since acts meant to neutralize impious actions are also fruitive, they will not release one from the tendency to act fruitively.</p>
<p>Persons who subject themselves to the rules and regulations of atonement are not at all intelligent.</p>
<p>Indeed, they are in the mode of darkness.</p>
<p>Unless one is freed from the mode of ignorance, trying to counteract one action through another is useless because this will not uproot one’s desires.</p>
<p>Thus even though one may superficially seem pious, he will undoubtedly be prone to act impiously.</p>
<p>Therefore real atonement is enlightenment in perfect knowledge, Vedanta, by which one understands the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The guru, Sukadeva Gosvami, has examined Pariksit Maharaja, and it appears that the King has passed one phase of the examination by rejecting the process of atonement because it involves fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Now Sukadeva Gosvami is suggesting the platform of speculative knowledge.</p>
<p>Progressing from karma-kanda to jnana-kanda, he is proposing, prayascittam vimarsanam: Real atonement is full knowledge Vimarsana refers to the cultivation of speculative knowledge.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita, karmis, who are lacking in knowledge, are compared to asses.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):</p>
<p>na mam duskrtino mudhah</p>
<p>prapadyante naradhamah</p>
<p>mayayapahrta-jnana</p>
<p>asuram bhavam asritah</p>
<p>Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me Thus karmis who engage in sinful acts and who do not know the true objective of life are called mudhas, asses.</p>
<p>Vimarsana, however, is also explained in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), where Krsna says, vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: the purpose of Vedic study is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If one studies Vedanta but merely advances somewhat in speculative knowledge and does not understand the Supreme Lord, one remains the same mudha.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (7.19), one attains real knowledge when he understands Krsna and surrenders unto Him (bahunam janmanam ante jnanavan mam prapadyate).</p>
<p>To become learned and free from material contamination, therefore, one should try to understand Krsna, for thus one is immediately liberated from all pious and impious activities and their reactions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King, if a diseased person eats the pure, uncontaminated food prescribed by a physician, he is gradually cured, and the infection of disease can no longer touch him.</p>
<p>Similarly, if one follows the regulative principles of knowledge, he gradually progresses toward liberation from material contamination.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One is gradually purified if one cultivates knowledge, even through mental speculation, and strictly follows the regulative principles enjoined in the sastras and explained in the next verse.</p>
<p>Therefore the platform of jnana, speculative knowledge, is better than the platform of karma, fruitive action.</p>
<p>There is every chance of falling from the platform of karma to hellish conditions, but on the platform of jnana one is saved from hellish life, although one is still not completely free from infection.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that on the platform of jnana one thinks that he has been liberated and has become Narayana, or Bhagavan.</p>

<p>Because of ignorance, one speculatively thinks himself liberated from material contamination although actually he is not.</p>
<p>Therefore even if one rises to brahma jnana, understanding of Brahman, one nevertheless falls down because of not taking shelter of the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, jnanis at least know what is sinful and what is pious, and they very cautiously act according to the injunctions of the sastras.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To concentrate the mind, one must observe a life of celibacy and not fall down.</p>
<p>One must undergo the austerity of voluntarily giving up sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>One must then control the mind and senses, give charity, be truthful, clean and nonviolent, follow the regulative principles and regularly chant the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus a sober and faithful person who knows the religious principles is temporarily purified of all sins performed with his body, words and mind.</p>
<p>These sins are like the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree, which may be burned by fire although their roots remain to grow again at the first opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Tapah is explained in the smrti-sastra as follows: manasas cendriyanam ca aikagryam paramam tapah Complete control of the mind and senses and their complete concentration on one kind of activity is called tapah Our Krsna consciousness movement is teaching people how to concentrate the mind on devotional service.</p>
<p>This is first-class tapah.</p>
<p>Brahmacarya, the life of celibacy, has eight aspects: one should not think of women, speak about sex life, dally with women, look lustfully at women, talk intimately with women or decide to engage in sexual intercourse, nor should one endeavor for sex life or engage in sex life.</p>
<p>One should not even think of women or look at them, to say nothing of talking with them.</p>
<p>This is called first-class brahmacarya.</p>
<p>If a brahmacari or sannyasi talks with a woman in a secluded place, naturally there will be a possibility of sex life without anyone’s knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore a complete brahmacari practices just the opposite.</p>
<p>If one is a perfect brahmacari, he can very easily control the mind and senses, give charity, speak truthfully and so forth.</p>
<p>To begin, however, one must control the tongue and the process of eating.</p>
<p>In the bhakti-marga, the path of devotional service, one must strictly follow the regulative principles by first controlling the tongue (sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah).</p>
<p>The tongue (jihva) can be controlled if one chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, does not speak of any subjects other than those concerning Krsna and does not taste anything not offered to Krsna.</p>
<p>If one can control the tongue in this way, brahmacarya and other purifying processes will automatically follow.</p>
<p>It will be explained in the next verse that the path of devotional service is completely perfect and is therefore superior to the path of fruitive activities and the path of knowledge.</p>
<p>Quoting from the Vedas, Srila Viraraghava Acarya explains that austerity involves observing fasts as fully as possible (tapasanasakena).</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami has also advised that atyahara, too much eating, is an impediment to advancement in spiritual life.</p>
<p>Also, in Bhagavad-gita (6.17) Krsna says:</p>
<p>yuktahara-viharasya</p>
<p>yukta-cestasya karmasu</p>
<p>yukta-svapnavabodhasya</p>
<p>yogo bhavati duhkha-ha</p>
<p>He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system In text 14 the word dhirah, meaning those who are undisturbed under all circumstances is very significant.</p>
<p>Krsna tells Arjuna in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):</p>
<p>matra-sparsas tu kaunteya</p>
<p>sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah</p>
<p>agamapayino ’nityas</p>
<p>tams titiksasva bharata</p>
<p>O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.</p>
<p>They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed In material life there are many disturbances (adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika).</p>
<p>One who has learned to tolerate these disturbances under all circumstances is called dhira.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Krsna can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive.</p>
<p>He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the previous verse Sukadeva Gosvami gave the example that the dried leaves of creepers beneath a bamboo tree may be completely burnt to ashes by a fire, although the creepers may sprout again because the root is still in the ground.</p>
<p>Similarly, because the root of sinful desire is not destroyed in the heart of a person who is cultivating knowledge but who has no taste for devotional service, there is a possibility that his sinful desires will reappear.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.4):</p>
<p>sreyah-srtim bhaktim udasya te vibho</p>
<p>klisyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye</p>
<p>Speculators who undergo great labor to gain a meticulous understanding of the material world by distinguishing between sinful and pious activities, but who are not situated in devotional service, are prone to material activities.</p>
<p>They may fall down and become implicated in fruitive activities.</p>
<p>If one becomes attached to devotional service, however, his desires for material enjoyment are automatically vanquished without separate endeavor.</p>
<p>Bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca: (SB 11.2.42) if one is advanced in Krsna consciousness, material activities, both sinful and pious, automatically become distasteful to him.</p>
<p>That is the test of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Both pious and impious activities are actually due to ignorance because a living entity, as an eternal servant of Krsna, has no need to act for his personal sense gratification.</p>
<p>Therefore as soon as one is reclaimed to the platform of devotional service, he relinquishes his attachment for pious and impious activities and is interested only in what will satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>This process of bhakti, devotional service to Krsna (vasudeva-parayana), relieves one from the reactions of all activities.</p>
<p>Since Maharaja Pariksit was a great devotee the answers of his guru, Sukadeva Gosvami, concerning karma-kanda and jnana-kanda could not satisfy him.</p>
<p>Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami, knowing very well the heart of his disciple, explained the transcendental bliss of devotional service.</p>
<p>The word kecit, which is used in this verse, means a few people but not all Not everyone can become Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>As Krsna explains in Bhagavad-gita (7.3):</p>
<p>manusyanam sahasresu</p>
<p>kascid yatati siddhaye</p>
<p>yatatam api siddhanam</p>
<p>kascin mam vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth Practically no one understands Krsna as He is, for Krsna cannot be understood through pious activities or attainment of the most elevated speculative knowledge.</p>
<p>Actually the highest knowledge consists of understanding Krsna.</p>
<p>Unintelligent men who do not understand Krsna are grossly puffed up, thinking that they are liberated or have themselves become Krsna or Narayana.</p>
<p>This is ignorance.</p>
<p>Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu (1.1.11):</p>
<p>anyabhilasita-sunyam</p>
<p>jnana-karmady-anavrtam</p>
<p>anukulyena krsnanu-</p>
<p>silanam bhaktir uttama</p>
<p>(Madhya 19.167)</p>
<p>One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation.</p>
<p>That is called pure devotional service Srila Rupa Gosvami further explains that bhakti is klesaghni subhada, which means if one takes to devotional service, all kinds of unnecessary labor and material distress cease entirely and one achieves all good fortune.</p>
<p>Bhakti is so powerful that it is also said to be moksa-laghutakrt; in other words, it minimizes the importance of liberation.</p>
<p>Nondevotees must undergo material hardships because they are prone to commit sinful fruitive activities.</p>
<p>The desire to commit sinful actions continues in their hearts due to ignorance.</p>
<p>These sinful actions are divided into three categories—pataka, maha-pataka and atipataka—and also into two divisions; prarabdha and aprarabdha.</p>
<p>Prarabdha refers to sinful reactions from which one is suffering at the present, and aprarabdha refers to sources of potential suffering.</p>
<p>When the seeds (bija) of sinful reactions have not yet fructified, the reactions are called aprarabdha.</p>
<p>These seeds of sinful action are unseen, but they are unlimited, and no one can trace when they were first planted.</p>
<p>Because of prarabdha, sinful reactions that have already fructified, one is seen to have taken birth in a low family or to be suffering from other miseries.</p>
<p>When one takes to devotional service, however, all phases of sinful life, including prarabdha, aprarabdha and bija, are vanquished.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.14.19) Lord Krsna tells Uddhava:</p>
<p>yathagnih susamrddharcih</p>
<p>karoty edhamsi bhasmasat</p>
<p>tatha mad-visaya bhaktir</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (3.33.6) in a verse spoken during Lord Kapiladeva’s instructions to His mother, Devahuti.</p>
<p>Devahuti said:</p>
<p>yan-namadheya-sravananukirtanad</p>
<p>yat-prahvanad yat-smaranad api kvacit</p>
<p>svado ’pi sadyah savanaya kalpate</p>
<p>kutah punas te bhagavan nu darsanat</p>
<p>My dear Lord, if even a person born in a family of dog-eaters hears and repeats the chanting of Your glories, offers respects to You and remembers You, he is immediately greater than a brahmana and is therefore eligible to perform sacrifices.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is to be said of one who has seen You directly In the Padma Purana there is a statement that persons whose hearts are always attached to the devotional service of Lord Visnu are immediately released from all the reactions of sinful life.</p>
<p>These reactions generally exist in four phases.</p>
<p>Some of them are ready to produce results immediately, some are in the form of seeds, some are unmanifested, and some are current.</p>
<p>All such reactions are immediately nullified by devotional service.</p>
<p>When devotional service is present in one’s heart, desires to perform sinful activities have no place there.</p>
<p>Sinful life is due to ignorance, which means forgetfulness of one’s constitutional position as an eternal servant of God, but when one is fully Krsna conscious he realizes that he is God’s eternal servant.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Jiva Gosvami comments that bhakti may be divided into two divisions: (1) santata, devotional service that continues incessantly with faith and love, and (2) kadacitki, devotional service that does not continue incessantly but is sometimes awakened.</p>
<p>Incessantly flowing devotional service (santata) may also be divided into two categories: (1) service performed with slight attachment and (2) spontaneous devotional service.</p>
<p>Intermittent devotional service (kadacitki) may be divided into three categories: (1) ragabhasamayi, devotional service in which one is almost attached, (2) ragabhasa-sunya-svarupa-bhuta, devotional service in which there is no spontaneous love but one likes the constitutional position of serving, and (3) abhasa-rupa, a slight glimpse of devotional service.</p>
<p>As for atonement, if one has caught even a slight glimpse of devotional service, all needs to undergo prayascitta, atonement, are superseded.</p>
<p>Therefore atonement is certainly unnecessary when one has achieved spontaneous love and, above that, attachment with love, which are signs of increasing advancement in kadacitki.</p>
<p>Even in the stage of abhasa-rupa bhakti, all the reactions of sinful life are uprooted and vanquished.</p>
<p>Srila Jiva Gosvami expresses the opinion that the word kartsnyena means that even if one has a desire to commit sinful actions, the roots of that desire are vanquished merely by abhasa-rupa bhakti.</p>
<p>The example of bhaskara, the sun, is most appropriate.</p>
<p>The abhasa feature of bhakti is compared to twilight, and the accumulation of one’s sinful activities is compared to fog.</p>
<p>Since fog does not spread throughout the sky, the sun need do no more than merely manifest its first rays, and the fog immediately disappears.</p>
<p>Similarly, if one has even a slight relationship with devotional service, all the fog of his sinful life is immediately vanquished.</p>

<p>Tat-purusa refers to a preacher of Krsna consciousness, such as the spiritual master.</p>
<p>Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has said, chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: Without serving a bona fide spiritual master, an ideal Vaisnava, who can be delivered from the clutches of maya This idea is also expressed in many other places.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.2) says, mahat-sevam dvaram ahur vimukteh: if one desires liberation from the clutches of maya, one must associate with a pure devotee mahatma.</p>
<p>A mahatma is one who engages twenty-four hours daily in the loving service of the Lord.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.13):</p>
<p>mahatmanas tu mam partha</p>
<p>daivim prakrtim asritah</p>
<p>bhajanty ananya-manaso</p>
<p>jnatva bhutadim avyayam</p>
<p>O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature.</p>
<p>They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible Thus the symptom of a mahatma is that he has no engagement other than service to Krsna.</p>
<p>One must render service to a Vaisnava in order to get freed from sinful reactions, revive one’s original Krsna consciousness and be trained in how to love Krsna.</p>
<p>This is the result of mahatma-seva.</p>
<p>Of course, if one engages in the service of a pure devotee, the reactions of one’s sinful life are vanquished automatically.</p>
<p>Devotional service is necessary not to drive away an insignificant stock of sins, but to awaken our dormant love for Krsna.</p>
<p>As fog is vanquished at the first glimpse of sunlight, one’s sinful reactions are automatically vanquished as soon as one begins serving a pure devotee; no separate endeavor is required.</p>
<p>The word krsna-rpita-pranah refers to a devotee who dedicates his life to serving Krsna, not to being saved from the path to hellish life.</p>
<p>A devotee is narayana-parayana, or vasudeva-parayana, which means that the path of Vasudeva, or the devotional path, is his life and soul.</p>
<p>Narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati (Bhag.6.17.28): such a devotee is not afraid of going anywhere.</p>
<p>There is a path toward liberation in the higher planetary systems and a path toward the hellish planets, but a narayana-para devotee is unafraid wherever he is sent; he simply wants to remember Krsna, wherever he may be.</p>
<p>Such a devotee is unconcerned with hell and heaven; he is simply attached to rendering service to Krsna.</p>
<p>When a devotee is put into hellish conditions, he accepts them as Krsna’s mercy: tat te ’nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag.10.14.8).</p>
<p>He does not protest, Oh, I am such a great devotee of Krsna.</p>
<p>Why have I been put into this misery Instead he thinks, This is Krsna’s mercy Such an attitude is possible for a devotee who engages in the service of Krsna’s representative.</p>
<p>This is the secret of success.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sadhricinah—just appropriate; hi—certainly; ayam—this; loke—in the world; panthah—path; ksemah—auspicious; akutah-bhayah—without fear; su-silah—well-behaved; sadhavah—saintly persons; yatra—wherein; narayana-parayanah—those who have taken the path of Narayana, devotional service, as their life and soul.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The path followed by pure devotees, who are well behaved and fully endowed with the best qualifications, is certainly the most auspicious path in this material world.</p>
<p>It is free from fear, and it is authorized by the sastras.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should not think that the person who takes to bhakti is one who cannot perform the ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the karma-kanda section of the Vedas or is not sufficiently educated to speculate on spiritual subjects.</p>
<p>Mayavadis generally allege that the bhakti path is for women and illiterates.</p>
<p>This is a groundless accusation.</p>
<p>The bhakti path is followed by the most learned scholars, such as the Gosvamis, Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Ramanujacarya.</p>
<p>These are the actual followers of the bhakti path.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not one is educated or aristocratic, one must follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah: one must follow the path of the mahajanas.</p>
<p>The mahajanas are those who have taken to the path of devotional service (susilah sadhavo yatra narayana-parayanah), for these great personalities are the perfect persons.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.18.12):</p>
<p>yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana</p>
<p>sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah</p>
<p>One who has unflinching devotion to the Personality of Godhead has all the good qualities of the demigods The less intelligent, however, misunderstand the bhakti path and therefore allege that it is for one who cannot execute ritualistic ceremonies or speculate.</p>
<p>As confirmed here by the word sadhricinah, bhakti is the path that is appropriate, not the paths of karma-kanda and jnana-kanda.</p>
<p>Mayavadis may be susilah sadhavah (well-behaved saintly persons), but there is nevertheless some doubt about whether they are actually making progress, for they have not accepted the path of bhakti.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who follow the path of the acaryas are susilah and sadhavah, but furthermore their path is akuto-bhaya, which means free from fear.</p>
<p>One should fearlessly follow the twelve mahajanas and their line of disciplic succession and thus be liberated from the clutches of maya.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>prayascittani—processes of atonement; cirnani—very nicely performed; narayana-paranmukham—a nondevotee; na nispunanti—cannot purify; rajendra—O King; sura-kumbham—a pot containing liquor; iva—like; apa-gah—the waters of the rivers.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King, as a pot containing liquor cannot be purified even if washed in the waters of many rivers, nondevotees cannot be purified by processes of atonement even if they perform them very well.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>To take advantage of the methods of atonement, one must be at least somewhat devoted; otherwise there is no chance of one’s being purified.</p>
<p>It is clear from this verse that even those who take advantage of karma-kanda and jnana-kanda, but are not at least slightly devoted cannot be purified simply by following these other paths.</p>
<p>The word prayascittani is plural in number to indicate both karma-kanda and jnana-kanda.</p>
<p>Narottama dasa Thakura therefore says, karma-kanda, jnana-kanda, kevala visera bhanda.</p>
<p>Thus Narottama dasa Thakura compares the paths of karma-kanda and jnana-kanda to pots of poison.</p>
<p>Liquor and poison are in the same category.</p>
<p>According to this verse from Srimad-Bhagavatam, a person who has heard a good deal about the path of devotional service, but who is not attached to it, who is not Krsna conscious, is like a pot of liquor.</p>
<p>Such a person cannot be purified without at least a slight touch of devotional service.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sakrt—once only; manah—the mind; krsna-pada-aravindayoh—unto the two lotus feet of Lord Krsna; nivesitam—completely surrendered; tat—of Krsna; guna-ragi—which is somewhat attached to the qualities, name, fame and paraphernalia; yaih—by whom; iha—in this world; na—not; te—such persons; yamam—Yamaraja, the superintendent of death; pasa-bhrtah—those who carry ropes (to catch sinful persons); ca—and; tat—his; bhatan—order carriers; svapne api—even in dreams; pasyanti—see; hi—indeed; cirna-niskrtah—who have performed the right type of atonement.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although not having fully realized Krsna, persons who have even once surrendered completely unto His lotus feet and who have become attracted to His name, form, qualities and pastimes are completely freed of all sinful reactions, for they have thus accepted the true method of atonement.</p>
<p>Even in dreams, such surrendered souls do not see Yamaraja or his order carriers, who are equipped with ropes to bind the sinful.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (18.66):</p>
<p>sarva-dharman parityajya</p>
<p>mam ekam saranam vraja</p>
<p>aham tvam sarva-papebhyo</p>
<p>moksayisyami ma sucah</p>
<p>Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.</p>
<p>I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction.</p>
<p>Do not fear This same principle is described here (sakrn manah krsna-padaravindayoh).</p>
<p>If by studying Bhagavad-gita one decides to surrender to Krsna, he is immediately freed from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>It is also significant that Sukadeva Gosvami, having several times repeated the words vasudeva-parayana and narayana-parayana, finally says krsna-padaravindayoh.</p>
<p>Thus he indicates that Krsna is the origin of both Narayana and Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Even though Narayana and Vasudeva are not different from Krsna, simply by surrendering to Krsna one fully surrenders to all His expansions, such as Narayana, Vasudeva and Govinda.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.7), mattah parataram nanyat: There is no truth superior to Me There are many names and forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krsna is the supreme form (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam).</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna recommends to neophyte devotees that one should surrender unto Him only (mam ekam).</p>
<p>Because neophyte devotees cannot understand what the forms of Narayana, Vasudeva and Govinda are, Krsna directly says, mam ekam.</p>
<p>Herein, this is also supported by the word krsna-padaravindayoh.</p>
<p>Narayana does not speak personally, but Krsna, or Vasudeva, does, as in Bhagavad-gita for example.</p>
<p>Therefore, to follow the direction of Bhagavad-gita means to surrender unto Krsna, and to surrender in this way is the highest perfection of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja had inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami how one can be saved from falling into the various conditions of hellish life.</p>
<p>In this verse Sukadeva Gosvami answers that a soul who has surrendered to Krsna certainly cannot go to naraka, hellish existence.</p>
<p>To say nothing of going there, even in his dreams he does not see Yamaraja or his order carriers, who are able to take one there.</p>
<p>In other words, if one wants to save himself from falling into naraka, hellish life, he should fully surrender to Krsna.</p>
<p>The word sakrt is significant because it indicates that if one sincerely surrenders to Krsna once, he is saved even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful activities.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (9.30):</p>
<p>api cet su-duracaro</p>
<p>bhajate mam ananya-bhak</p>
<p>sadhur eva sa mantavyah</p>
<p>samyag vyavasito hi sah</p>
<p>Even if one commits the most abominable actions, if he is engaged in devotional service he is to be considered saintly because he is properly situated If one never for a moment forgets Krsna, he is safe even if by chance he falls down by committing sinful acts.</p>
<p>In the Second Chapter of Bhagavad-gita (2.40) the Lord also says:</p>
<p>nehabhikrama-naso ’sti</p>
<p>pratyavayo na vidyate</p>
<p>svalpam apy asya dharmasya</p>
<p>Gita (6.40) the Lord says, na hi kalyana-krt kascid durgatim tata gacchati: one who performs auspicious activity is never overcome by evil The highest kalyana (auspicious) activity is to surrender to Krsna.</p>
<p>That is the only path by which to save oneself from falling down into hellish life.</p>
<p>Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati has confirmed this as follows:</p>
<p>kaivalyam narakayate tri-dasa-pur akasa-puspayate</p>
<p>durdantendriya-kala-sarpa-patali protkhata-damstrayate</p>
<p>visvam purna-sukhayate vidhi-mahendradis ca kitayate</p>
<p>yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah</p>
<p>The sinful actions of one who has surrendered unto Krsna are compared to a snake with its poison fangs removed (protkhata-damstrayate).</p>
<p>Such a snake is no longer to be feared.</p>
<p>Of course, one should not commit sinful activities on the strength of having surrendered to Krsna.</p>
<p>However, even if one who has surrendered to Krsna happens to do something sinful because of his former habits, such sinful actions no longer have a destructive effect.</p>
<p>Therefore one should adhere to the lotus feet of Krsna very tightly and serve Him under the direction of the spiritual master.</p>
<p>Thus in all conditions one will be akuto-bhaya, free from fear.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, learned scholars and saintly persons describe a very old historical incident involving a discussion between the order carriers of Lord Visnu and those of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>Please hear of this from me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Puranas, or old histories, are sometimes neglected by unintelligent men who consider their descriptions mythological.</p>
<p>Actually, the descriptions of the Puranas, or the old histories of the universe, are factual, although not chronological.</p>
<p>The puranas record the chief incidents that have occurred over many millions of years, not only on this planet but also on other planets within the universe.</p>
<p>Therefore all learned and realized Vedic scholars speak with references to the incidents in the Puranas.</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami accepts the Puranas to be as important as the Vedas themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu he quotes the following verse from the Brahma-yamala:</p>
<p>sruti-smrti-puranadi-</p>
<p>pancaratra-vidhim vina</p>
<p>aikantiki harer bhaktir</p>
<p>utpatayaiva kalpate</p>
<p>(BRS 1.2.101)</p>
<p>Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upanisads, puranas and Narada-pancaratra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society A devotee of Krsna must refer not only to the Vedas, but also to the puranas.</p>
<p>One should not foolishly consider the Puranas mythological.</p>
<p>If they were mythological, Sukadeva Gosvami would not have taken the trouble to recite the old historical incidents concerning the life of Ajamila.</p>
<p>Now the history begins as follows.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#6121" id="6121">6.1.21</a></h3>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the city known as Kanyakubja there was a brahmana named Ajamila who married a prostitute maidservant and lost all his brahminical qualities because of the association of that low-class woman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The fault of illicit connection with women is that it makes one lose all brahminical qualities.</p>
<p>In India there is still a class of servants, called sudras, whose maidservant wives are called sudranis.</p>
<p>Sometimes people who are very lusty establish relationships with such maidservants and sweeping women, since in the higher statuses of society they cannot indulge in the habit of woman hunting, which is strictly prohibited by social convention.</p>
<p>Ajamila, a qualified brahmana youth, lost all his brahminical qualities because of his association with a prostitute, but he was ultimately saved because he had begun the process of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Therefore in the previous verse, Sukadeva Gosvami spoke of the person who has only once surrendered himself at the lotus feet of the Lord (manah krsna-padaravindayoh) or has just begun the bhakti-yoga process.</p>
<p>Bhakti-yoga begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh (SB 7.5.23), hearing and chanting of Lord Visnu’s names, as in the maha-mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>Chanting is the beginning of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu declares:</p>
<p>harer nama harer nama</p>
<p>harer namaiva kevalam</p>
<p>kalau nasty eva nasty eva</p>
<p>nasty eva gatir anyatha</p>
<p>(Adi 17.21)</p>
<p>In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way The process of chanting the holy name of the Lord is always superbly effective, but it is especially effective in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>Its practical effectiveness will now be explained by Sukadeva Gosvami through the history of Ajamila, who was freed from the hands of the Yamadutas simply because of chanting the holy name of Narayana.</p>
<p>Pariksit Maharaja’s original question was how to be freed from falling down into hell or into the hands of the Yamadutas.</p>
<p>In reply, Sukadeva Gosvami is citing this old historical example to convince Pariksit Maharaja of the potency of bhakti-yoga, which begins simply with the chanting of the Lord’s name.</p>
<p>All the great authorities of bhakti-yoga recommend the devotional process beginning with the chanting of the holy name of Krsna (tan-nama-grahanadibhih).</p>

<p>This fallen brahmana, Ajamila, gave trouble to others by arresting them, by cheating them in gambling or by directly plundering them.</p>
<p>This was the way he earned his livelihood and maintained his wife and children.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse indicates how degraded one becomes simply by indulging in illicit sex with a prostitute.</p>
<p>Illicit sex is not possible with a chaste or aristocratic woman, but only with unchaste sudras.</p>
<p>The more society allows prostitution and illicit sex, the more impetus it gives to cheaters, thieves, plunderers, drunkards and gamblers.</p>
<p>Therefore we first advise all the disciples in our Krsna consciousness movement to avoid illicit sex, which is the beginning of all abominable life and which is followed by meat-eating, gambling and intoxication, one after another.</p>
<p>Of course, restraint is very difficult, but it is quite possible if one fully surrenders to Krsna, since all these abominable habits gradually become distasteful for a Krsna conscious person.</p>
<p>If illicit sex is allowed to increase in a society, however, the entire society will be condemned, for it will be full of rogues, thieves, cheaters and so forth.</p>

<p>Since Narayana was the youngest of all the sons, he was naturally very dear to both his father and his mother.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word pravayasah indicates Ajamila’s sinfulness because although he was eighty-eight years old, he had a very young child.</p>
<p>According to Vedic culture, one should leave home as soon as he has reached fifty years of age; one should not live at home and go on producing children.</p>
<p>Sex life is allowed for twenty-five years, between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five or, at the most, fifty.</p>
<p>After that one should give up the habit of sex life and leave home as a vanaprastha and then properly take sannyasa.</p>
<p>Ajamila, however, because of his association with a prostitute, lost all brahminical culture and became most sinful, even in his so-called household life.</p>

<p>He always took care of the child and enjoyed the child’s activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here it is clearly mentioned that the child Narayana was so young that he could not even speak or walk properly.</p>
<p>Since the old man was very attached to the child, he enjoyed the child’s activities, and because the child’s name was Narayana, the old man always chanted the holy name of Narayana.</p>
<p>Although he was referring to the small child and not to the original Narayana, the name of Narayana is so powerful that even by chanting his son’s name he was becoming purified (harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam (Adi 17.21)).</p>
<p>Srila Rupa Gosvami has therefore declared that if one’s mind is somehow or other attracted by the holy name of Krsna (tasmat kenapy upayena manah krsne nivesayet), one is on the path of liberation.</p>
<p>It is customary in Hindu society for parents to give their children names like Krsnadasa, Govinda dasa, Narayana dasa and Vrndavana dasa.</p>
<p>Thus they chant the names Krsna, Govinda, Narayana and Vrndavana and get the chance to be purified.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When the time of death arrived for the foolish Ajamila, he began thinking exclusively of his son Narayana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.1.6) Sukadeva Gosvami says:</p>
<p>etavan sankhya-yogabhyam</p>
<p>svadharma-parinisthaya</p>
<p>janma-labhah parah pumsam</p>
<p>ante narayana-smrtih</p>
<p>The highest perfection of human life, achieved either by complete knowledge of matter and spirit, by acquirement of mystic powers, or by perfect discharge of one’s occupational duty, is to remember the Personality of Godhead at the end of life Somehow or other, Ajamila consciously or unconsciously chanted the name of Narayana at the time of death (ante narayana-smrtih), and therefore he became all-perfect simply by concentrating his mind on the name of Narayana.</p>
<p>It may also be concluded that Ajamila, who was the son of a brahmana, was accustomed to worshiping Narayana in his youth because in every brahmana’s house there is worship of the narayana-sila.</p>
<p>This system is still present in India; in a rigid brahmana’s house, there is narayana-seva, worship of Narayana.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the contaminated Ajamila was calling for his son, by concentrating his mind on the holy name of Narayana he remembered the Narayana he had very faithfully worshiped in his youth.</p>
<p>In this regard Srila Sridhara Svami expressed his verdict as follows: etac ca tad-upalalanadi-sri-narayana-namoccarana-mahatmyena tad-bhaktir evabhud iti siddhantopayogitvenapi drastavyam According to the bhakti-siddhanta, it is to be analyzed that because Ajamila constantly chanted his son’s name, Narayana, he was elevated to the platform of bhakti, although he did not know it Similarly, Srila Viraraghava Acarya gives this opinion: evam vartamanah sa dvijah mrtyu-kale upasthite satyajno narayanakhye putra eva matim cakara matim asaktam akarod ity arthah Although at the time of death he was chanting the name of his son, he nevertheless concentrated his mind upon the holy name of Narayana Srila Vijayadhvaja Tirtha gives a similar opinion:</p>
<p>mrtyu-kale deha-viyoga-laksana-kale mrtyoh sarva-dosa-papa-harasya harer anugrahat kale datta-jnana-laksane upasthite hrdi prakasite tanaye purna-jnane bale panca-varsa-kalpe pradesa-matre narayanahvaye murti-visese matim smarana-samartham cittam cakara bhaktyasmarad ity arthah.</p>
<p>Directly or indirectly, Ajamila factually remembered Narayana at the time of death (ante narayana-smrtih).</p>

<p>Ajamila then saw three awkward persons with deformed bodily features, fierce, twisted faces, and hair standing erect on their bodies.</p>
<p>With ropes in their hands, they had come to take him away to the abode of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>When he saw them he was extremely bewildered, and because of attachment to his child, who was playing a short distance away, Ajamila began to call him loudly by his name.</p>
<p>Thus with tears in his eyes he somehow or other chanted the holy name of Narayana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A person who performs sinful activities performs them with his body, mind and words.</p>
<p>Therefore three order carriers from Yamaraja came to take Ajamila to Yamaraja’s abode.</p>
<p>Fortunately, even though he was referring to his son, Ajamila chanted the four syllables of the hari-nama Narayana, and therefore the order carriers of Narayana, the Visnudutas, also immediately arrived there.</p>

<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks, hari-kirtanam nisamyapatan, katham-bhutasya bhartur nama bruvatah: the order carriers of Lord Visnu came because Ajamila had chanted the holy name of Narayana.</p>
<p>They did not consider why he was chanting.</p>
<p>While chanting the name of Narayana, Ajamila was actually thinking of his son, but simply because they heard Ajamila chanting the Lord’s name, the order carriers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, immediately came for Ajamila’s protection.</p>
<p>Hari-kirtana is actually meant to glorify the holy name, form, pastimes and qualities of the Lord.</p>
<p>Ajamila, however, did not glorify the form, qualities or paraphernalia of the Lord; he simply chanted the holy name.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that chanting was sufficient to cleanse him of all sinful activities.</p>
<p>As soon as the Visnudutas heard their master’s name being chanted, they immediately came.</p>
<p>In this regard Srila Vijayadhvaja Tirtha remarks: anena putra-sneham antarena pracinadrsta-balad udbhutaya bhaktya bhagavan-nama-sankirtanam krtam iti jnayate Ajamila chanted the name of Narayana because of his excessive attachment to his son.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because of his past good fortune in having rendered devotional service to Narayana, he apparently chanted the holy name in full devotional service and without offenses</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The order carriers of Yamaraja were snatching the soul from the core of the heart of Ajamila, the husband of the prostitute, but with resounding voices the messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, forbade them to do so.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A Vaisnava, one who has surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu, is always protected by Lord Visnu’s order carriers.</p>
<p>Because Ajamila had chanted the holy name of Narayana, the Visnudutas not only immediately arrived on the spot but also at once ordered the Yamadutas not to touch him.</p>
<p>By speaking with resounding voices, the Visnudutas threatened to punish the Yamadutas if they continued trying to snatch Ajamila’s soul from his heart.</p>
<p>The order carriers of Yamaraja have jurisdiction over all sinful living entities, but the messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, are capable of punishing anyone, including Yamaraja, if he wrongs a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Materialistic scientists do not know where to find the soul within the body with their material instruments, but this verse clearly explains that the soul is within the core of the heart (hrdaya); it is from the heart that the Yamadutas were extracting the soul of Ajamila.</p>
<p>Similarly, we learn that the Supersoul, Lord Visnu, is also situated within the heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati (Bg.18.61)).</p>
<p>In the Upanisads it is said that the Supersoul and the individual soul are living in the same tree of the body as two friendly birds.</p>
<p>The Supersoul is said to be friendly because the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so kind to the original soul that when the original soul transmigrates from one body to another, the Lord goes with him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the desire and karma of the individual soul, the Lord, through the agency of maya, creates another body for him.</p>
<p>The heart of the body is a mechanical arrangement.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):</p>
<p>isvarah sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati</p>
<p>bhramayan sarva-bhutani</p>
<p>yantrarudhani mayaya</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy Yantra means a machine, such as an automobile.</p>
<p>The driver of the machine of the body is the individual soul, who is also its director or proprietor, but the supreme proprietor is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One’s body is created through the agency of maya (karmana daiva-netrena), and according to one’s activities in this life, another vehicle is created, again under the supervision of daivi maya (daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya).</p>
<p>At the appropriate time, one’s next body is immediately chosen, and both the individual soul and the Supersoul transfer to that particular bodily machine.</p>
<p>This is the process of transmigration.</p>
<p>During transmigration from one body to the next, the soul is taken away by the order carriers of Yamaraja and put into a particular type of hellish life (naraka) in order to become accustomed to the condition in which he will live in his next body.</p>

<p>According to the sinful activities of Ajamila, he was within the jurisdiction of Yamaraja, the supreme judge appointed to consider the sins of the living entities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dear sirs, whose servants are you, where have you come from, and why are you forbidding us to touch the body of Ajamila? Are you demigods from the heavenly planets, are you sub-demigods, or are you the best of devotees?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The most significant word used in this verse is siddha-sattamah, which means the best of the perfect In Bhagavad-gita (7.3) it is said, manusyanam sahasresu kascid yatati siddhaye: out of millions of persons, one may try to become siddha, perfect—or, in other words, self-realized.</p>
<p>A self-realized person knows that he is not the body but a spiritual soul (aham brahmasmi).</p>
<p>At the present moment practically everyone is unaware of this fact, but one who understands this has attained perfection and is therefore called siddha.</p>
<p>When one understands that the soul is part and parcel of the supreme soul and one thus engages in the devotional service of the supreme soul, one becomes siddha-sat-tama.</p>
<p>One is then eligible to live in the Vaikuntha planets or Krsnaloka.</p>
<p>The word siddha-sattama, therefore, refers to a liberated, pure devotee.</p>
<p>Since the Yamadutas are servants of Yamaraja, who is also one of the siddha-sattamas, they knew that a siddha-sattama is above the demigods and sub-demigods and, indeed, above all the living entities within this material world.</p>
<p>The Yamadutas therefore inquired why the Visnudutas were present where a sinful man was going to die.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that Ajamila was not yet dead, for the Yamadutas were trying to snatch the soul from his heart.</p>
<p>They could not take the soul, however, and therefore Ajamila was not yet dead.</p>
<p>This will be revealed in later verses.</p>
<p>Ajamila was simply in an unconscious state when the argument was in progress between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the argument was to be a decision regarding who would claim the soul of Ajamila.</p>

<p>The order carriers of Yamaraja said: Your eyes are just like the petals of lotus flowers.</p>
<p>Dressed in yellow silken garments, decorated with garlands of lotuses, and wearing very attractive helmets on your heads and earrings on your ears, you all appear fresh and youthful.</p>
<p>Your four long arms are decorated with bows and quivers of arrows and with swords, clubs, conchshells, discs and lotus flowers.</p>
<p>Your effulgence has dissipated the darkness of this place with extraordinary illumination.</p>
<p>Now, sirs, why are you obstructing us?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Before even being introduced to a foreigner, one becomes acquainted with him through his dress, bodily features and behavior and can thus understand his position.</p>
<p>Therefore when the Yamadutas saw the Visnudutas for the first time, they were surprised.</p>
<p>They said, By your bodily features you appear to be very exalted gentlemen, and you have such celestial power that you have dissipated the darkness of this material world with your own effulgences.</p>
<p>Why then should you endeavor to stop us from executing our duty It will be explained that the Yamadutas, the order carriers of Yamaraja, mistakenly considered Ajamila sinful.</p>
<p>They did not know that although he was sinful throughout his entire life, he was purified by constantly chanting the holy name of Narayana.</p>
<p>In other words, unless one is a Vaisnava, one cannot understand the activities of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>The dress and bodily features of the residents of Vaikunthaloka are properly described in these verses.</p>
<p>The residents of Vaikuntha, who are decorated with garlands and yellow silken garments, have four arms holding various weapons.</p>
<p>Thus they conspicuously resemble Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>They have the same bodily features as Narayana because they have attained the liberation of sarupya, but they nevertheless act as servants.</p>
<p>All the residents of Vaikunthaloka know perfectly well that their master is Narayana, or Krsna, and that they are all His servants.</p>
<p>They are all self-realized souls who are nitya-mukta, everlastingly liberated.</p>
<p>Although they could conceivably declare themselves Narayana or Visnu, they never do so; they always remain Krsna conscious and serve the Lord faithfully.</p>
<p>Such is the atmosphere of Vaikunthaloka.</p>
<p>Similarly, one who learns the faithful service of Lord Krsna through the Krsna consciousness movement will always remain in Vaikunthaloka and have nothing to do with the material world.</p>

<p>The blessed messengers of Lord Visnu, the Visnudutas, said: If you are actually servants of Yamaraja, you must explain to us the meaning of religious principles and the symptoms of irreligion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This inquiry by the Visnudutas to the Yamadutas is most important.</p>
<p>A servant must know the instructions of his master.</p>
<p>The servants of Yamaraja claimed to be carrying out his orders, and therefore the Visnudutas very intelligently asked them to explain the symptoms of religious and irreligious principles.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava knows these principles perfectly well because he is well acquainted with the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) Give up all other varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me Therefore surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the actual principle of religion.</p>
<p>Those who have surrendered to the principles of material nature instead of to Krsna are all impious, regardless of their material position.</p>
<p>Unaware of the principles of religion, they do not surrender to Krsna, and therefore they are considered sinful rascals, the lowest of men, and fools bereft of all knowledge.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):</p>
<p>na mam duskrtino mudhah</p>
<p>prapadyante naradhamah</p>
<p>mayayapahrta-jnana</p>
<p>asuram bhavam asritah</p>
<p>Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me One who has not surrendered to Krsna does not know the true principle of religion; otherwise he would have surrendered.</p>
<p>The question posed by the Visnudutas was very suitable.</p>
<p>One who represents someone else must fully know that person’s mission.</p>
<p>The devotees in the Krsna consciousness movement must therefore be fully aware of the mission of Krsna and Lord Caitanya; otherwise they will be considered foolish.</p>
<p>All devotees, especially preachers, must know the philosophy of Krsna consciousness so as not to be embarrassed and insulted when they preach.</p>

<p>Therefore, as stated in the beginning of Srimad-Bhagavatam, dharmah projjhita-kaitavo ’tra: (SB 1.1.2) dharma not supported by the Vedas is rejected from srimad-bhagavata-dharma.Bhagavata-dharma comprises only that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Bhagavata-dharma is sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) one must accept the authority of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrender to Him and whatever He says.</p>
<p>That is dharma.</p>
<p>Arjuna, for example, thinking that violence was adharma, was declining to fight, but Krsna urged him to fight.</p>
<p>Arjuna abided by the orders of Krsna, and therefore he is actually a dharmi because the order of Krsna is dharma.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: The real purpose of veda, knowledge, is to know Me One who knows Krsna perfectly is liberated.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna One who understands Krsna and abides by His order is a candidate for returning home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>It may be concluded that dharma, religion, refers to that which is ordered in the Vedas, and adharma, irreligion, refers to that which is not supported in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Dharma is not actually manufactured by Narayana.</p>
<p>As stated in the Vedas, asya mahato bhutasya nisvasitam etad yad rg-vedah iti: the injunctions of dharma emanate from the breathing of Narayana, the supreme living entity.</p>
<p>Narayana exists eternally and breathes eternally, and therefore dharma, the injunctions of Narayana, also exist eternally.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya, the original acarya for those who belong to the Madhva-Gaudiya-sampradaya, says:</p>
<p>vedanam prathamo vakta</p>
<p>harir eva yato vibhuh</p>
<p>ato visnv-atmaka veda</p>
<p>ity ahur veda-vadinah</p>
<p>The transcendental words of the Vedas emanated from the mouth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic principles should be understood to be Vaisnava principles because Visnu is the origin of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The Vedas contain nothing besides the instructions of Visnu, and one who follows the Vedic principles is a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>The Vaisnava is not a member of a manufactured community of this material world.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is a real knower of the Vedas, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>

<p>The supreme cause of all causes, Narayana, is situated in His own abode in the spiritual world, but nevertheless He controls the entire cosmic manifestation according to the three modes of material nature—sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.</p>
<p>In this way all living entities are awarded different qualities, different names (such as brahmana, ksatriya and vaisya), different duties according to the varnasrama institution, and different forms.</p>
<p>Thus Narayana is the cause of the entire cosmic manifestation.</p>

<p>Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is almighty, omnipotent.</p>
<p>He has multifarious energies, and therefore He is able to remain in His own abode and without endeavor supervise and manipulate the entire cosmic manifestation through the interaction of the three modes of material nature—sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.</p>
<p>These interactions create different forms, bodies, activities and changes, which all occur perfectly.</p>
<p>Because the Lord is perfect, everything works as if He were directly supervising and taking part in it.</p>
<p>Atheistic men, however, being covered by the three modes of material nature, cannot see Narayana to be the supreme cause behind all activities.</p>

<p>The sun, fire, sky, air, demigods, moon, evening, day, night, directions, water, land and Supersoul Himself all witness the activities of the living entity.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The members of some religious sects, especially Christians, do not believe in the reactions of karma.</p>
<p>We once had a discussion with a learned Christian professor who argued that although people are generally punished after the witnesses of their misdeeds are examined, where are the witnesses responsible for one’s suffering the reactions of past karma? To such a person the answer by the Yamadutas is given here.</p>
<p>A conditioned soul thinks that he is working stealthily and that no one can see his sinful activities, but we can understand from the sastras that there are many witnesses, including the sun, fire, sky, air, moon, demigods, evening, day, night, directions, water, land and the Supersoul Himself, who sits with the individual soul within his heart.</p>
<p>Where is the dearth of witnesses? The witnesses and the Supreme Lord both exist, and therefore so many living entities are elevated to higher planetary systems or degraded to lower planetary systems, including the hellish planets.</p>
<p>There are no discrepancies, for everything is arranged perfectly by the management of the Supreme God (svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca).</p>
<p>The witnesses mentioned in this verse are also mentioned in other Vedic literatures:</p>
<p>aditya-candrav anilo ’nalas ca</p>

<p>O inhabitants of Vaikuntha, you are sinless, but those within this material world are all karmis, whether acting piously or impiously.</p>
<p>Both kinds of action are possible for them because they are contaminated by the three modes of nature and must act accordingly.</p>
<p>One who has accepted a material body cannot be inactive, and sinful action is inevitable for one acting under the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore all the living entities within this material world are punishable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The difference between human beings and nonhuman beings is that a human is supposed to act according to the direction of the Vedas.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O best of the demigods, we can see three different varieties of life, which are due to the contamination of the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>The living entities are thus known as peaceful, restless and foolish; as happy, unhappy or in-between; or as religious, irreligious and semireligious.</p>
<p>We can deduce that in the next life these three kinds of material nature will similarly act.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The actions and reactions of the three modes of material nature are visible in this life.</p>
<p>For example, some people are very happy, some are very distressed, and some are in mixed happiness and distress.</p>
<p>This is the result of past association with the modes of material nature—goodness, passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Since these varieties are visible in this life, we may assume that the living entities, according to their association with the different modes of material nature, will be happy, distressed or between the two in their next lives also.</p>
<p>Therefore the best policy is to disassociate oneself from the three modes of material nature and be always transcendental to their contamination.</p>
<p>This is possible only when one fully engages in the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>As Krsna confirms in Bhagavad-gita (14.26):</p>
<p>mam ca yo ’vyabhicarena</p>
<p>bhakti-yogena sevate</p>
<p>sa gunan samatityaitan</p>
<p>brahma-bhuyaya kalpate</p>
<p>One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down under any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the spiritual platform Unless one is fully absorbed in the service of the Lord, one is subject to the contamination of the three modes of material nature and must therefore suffer from distress or mixed happiness and distress.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As a sleeping person acts according to the body manifested in his dreams and accepts it to be himself, so one identifies with his present body, which he acquired because of his past religious or irreligious actions, and is unable to know his past or future lives.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A man engages in sinful activities because he does not know what he did in his past life to get his present materially conditioned body, which is subjected to the threefold miseries.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.4), nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: a human being who is mad after sense gratification does not hesitate to act sinfully.</p>
<p>Yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti: he performs sinful actions simply for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Na sadhu manye: this is not good.</p>
<p>Yata atmano ’yam asann api klesada asa dehah: because of such sinful actions, one receives another body in which to suffer as he is suffering in his present body because of his past sinful activities.</p>
<p>It should be understood that a person who does not have Vedic knowledge always acts in ignorance of what he has done in the past, what he is doing at the present and how he will suffer in the future.</p>
<p>He is completely in darkness.</p>
<p>Therefore the Vedic injunction is, tamasi ma: Don’t remain in darkness Jyotir gama: Try to go to the light The light or illumination is Vedic knowledge, which one can understand when he is elevated to the mode of goodness or when he transcends the mode of goodness by engaging in devotional service to the spiritual master and the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Svetasvatara Upanisad (6.23):</p>
<p>yasya deve para bhaktir</p>
<p>yatha deve tatha gurau</p>
<p>tasyaite kathita hy arthah</p>
<p>prakasante mahatmanah</p>
<p>(SU 6.23)</p>
<p>Unto those great souls who have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master, all the imports of Vedic knowledge are automatically revealed The Vedas enjoin, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: (MU1.2.12) one must approach a spiritual master who has full knowledge of the Vedas and be faithfully directed by him in order to become a devotee of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then the knowledge of the Vedas will be revealed.</p>
<p>When the Vedic knowledge is revealed, one need no longer remain in the darkness of material nature.</p>
<p>According to his association with the material modes of nature—goodness, passion and ignorance—a living entity gets a particular type of body.</p>
<p>The example of one who associates with the mode of goodness is a qualified brahmana.</p>
<p>Such a brahmana knows past, present and future because he consults the Vedic literature and sees through the eyes of sastra (sastra-caksuh).</p>
<p>He can understand what his past life was, why be is in the present body, and how he can obtain liberation from the clutches of maya and not accept another material body.</p>
<p>This is all possible when one is situated in the mode of goodness.</p>
<p>Generally, however, the living entities are engrossed in the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>In any case, one receives an inferior or superior body at the discretion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramatma.</p>
<p>As stated in the previous verse:</p>
<p>manasaiva pure devah</p>
<p>purva-rupam vipasyati</p>
<p>anumimamsate ’purvam</p>
<p>manasa bhagavan ajah</p>
<p>Everything depends on bhagavan, or ajah, the unborn.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t one please Bhagavan to receive a better body? The answer is ajnas tamasa: because of gross ignorance.</p>
<p>One who is in complete darkness cannot know what his past life was or what his next life will be; he is simply interested in his present body.</p>
<p>Even though he has a human body, a person in the mode of ignorance and interested only in his present body is like an animal, for an animal, being covered by ignorance, thinks that the ultimate goal of life and happiness is to eat as much as possible.</p>
<p>A human being must be educated to understand his past life and how he can endeavor for a better life in the future.</p>
<p>There is even a book, called Bhrgu-samhita, which reveals information about one’s past, present and future lives according to astrological calculations.</p>
<p>Somehow or other one must be enlightened about his past, present and future.</p>
<p>One who is interested only in his present body and who tries to enjoy his senses to the fullest extent is understood to be engrossed in the mode of ignorance.</p>
<p>His future is very, very dark.</p>
<p>Indeed, the future is always dark for one who is grossly covered by ignorance.</p>
<p>Especially in this age, human society is covered by the mode of ignorance, and therefore everyone thinks his present body to be everything, without consideration of the past or future.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Above the five senses of perception, the five working senses and the five objects of the senses is the mind, which is the sixteenth element.</p>
<p>Above the mind is the seventeenth element, the soul, the living being himself, who, in cooperation with the other sixteen, enjoys the material world alone.</p>
<p>The living being enjoys three kinds of situations, namely happy, distressful and mixed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Everyone engages in work with his hands, legs and other senses just to achieve a certain goal according to his concocted ideas.</p>
<p>One tries to enjoy the five sense objects, namely form, sound, taste, aroma and touch, not knowing the actual goal of life, which is to satisfy the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Because of disobeying the Supreme Lord, one is put into material conditions, and he then tries to improve his situation in a concocted way, not desiring to follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Supreme Lord is so kind that He comes Himself to instruct the bewildered living entity how to act obediently and then gradually return home, back to Godhead, where he can attain an eternal, peaceful life of bliss and knowledge.</p>
<p>The living entity has a body, which is a very complicated combination of the material elements, and with this body he struggles alone, as indicated in this verse by the words ekas tu.</p>
<p>For example, if one is struggling in the ocean, he must swim through it alone.</p>
<p>Although many other men and aquatics are swimming in the ocean, he must take care of himself because no one else will help him.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse indicates that the seventeenth item, the soul, must work alone.</p>
<p>Although he tries to create society, friendship and love, no one will be able to help him but Krsna, the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore his only concern should be how to satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>That is also what Krsna wants (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja (Bg.18.66)).</p>
<p>People bewildered by material conditions try to be united, but although they strive for unity among men and nations, all their attempts are futile.</p>
<p>Everyone must struggle alone for existence with the many elements of nature.</p>
<p>Therefore one’s only hope, as Krsna advises, is to surrender to Him, for He can help one become free from the ocean of nescience.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore prayed:</p>
<p>ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram</p>
<p>patitam mam visame bhavambudhau</p>
<p>krpaya tava pada-pankaja-</p>

<p>taribare na dekhi upaya</p>
<p>My dear Lord, I cannot remember when I somehow or other fell into this ocean of nescience, and now I can find no way to rescue myself We should remember that everyone is responsible for his own life.</p>
<p>If an individual becomes a pure devotee of Krsna, he is then delivered from the ocean of nescience.</p>

<p>The subtle body is endowed with sixteen parts—the five knowledge-acquiring senses, the five working senses, the five objects of sense gratification, and the mind.</p>
<p>This subtle body is an effect of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>It is composed of insurmountably strong desires, and therefore it causes the living entity to transmigrate from one body to another in human life, animal life and life as a demigod.</p>
<p>When the living entity gets the body of a demigod, he is certainly very jubilant, when he gets a human body he is always in lamentation, and when he gets the body of an animal, he is always afraid.</p>
<p>In all conditions, however, he is actually miserable.</p>
<p>His miserable condition is called samsrti, or transmigration in material life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The sum and substance of material conditional life is explained in this verse.</p>
<p>The living entity, the seventeenth element, is struggling alone, life after life.</p>
<p>This struggle is called samsrti, or material conditional life.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita it is said that the force of material nature is insurmountably strong (daivi hy esa guna-mayi mama maya duratyaya).</p>
<p>Material nature harasses the living entity in different bodies, but if the living entity surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes free from this entanglement, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (mam eva ye prapadyante mayam etam taranti te (Bg.7.14)).</p>
<p>Thus his life becomes successful.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The foolish embodied living entity, inept at controlling his senses and mind, is forced to act according to the influence of the modes of material nature, against his desires.</p>
<p>He is like a silkworm that uses its own saliva to create a cocoon and then becomes trapped in it, with no possibility of getting out.</p>
<p>The living entity traps himself in a network of his own fruitive activities and then can find no way to release himself.</p>
<p>Thus he is always bewildered, and repeatedly he dies.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As already explained, the influence of the modes of nature is very strong.</p>
<p>The living entity entangled in different types of fruitive activity is like a silkworm trapped in a cocoon.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Not a single living entity can remain unengaged even for a moment.</p>
<p>One must act by his natural tendency according to the three modes of material nature because this natural tendency forcibly makes him work in a particular way.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The svabhavika, or one’s natural tendency, is the most important factor in action.</p>
<p>One’s natural tendency is to serve because a living entity is an eternal servant of God.</p>
<p>The living entity wants to serve, but because of his forgetfulness of his relationship with the Supreme Lord, he serves under the modes of material nature and manufactures various modes of service, such as socialism, humanitarianism and altruism.</p>
<p>However, one should be enlightened in the tenets of Bhagavad-gita and accept the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one give up all natural tendencies for material service under different names and take to the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>One’s original natural tendency is to act in Krsna consciousness because one’s real nature is spiritual.</p>
<p>The duty of a human being is to understand that since he is essentially spirit, he must abide by the spiritual tendency and not be carried away by material tendencies.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has therefore sung:</p>
<p>khaccha habudubu, bhai</p>
<p>My dear brothers, you are being carried away by the waves of material energy and are suffering in many miserable conditions.</p>
<p>Sometimes you are drowning in the waves of material nature, and sometimes you are tossed like a swimmer struggling in the ocean As confirmed by Bhaktivinoda Thakura, this tendency to be battered by the waves of maya can be changed to one’s original, natural tendency, which is spiritual, when the living entity comes to understand that he is eternally krsna-dasa, a servant of God, Krsna karle ta’ ara duhkha nai If instead of serving maya under different names, one turns his service attitude toward the Supreme Lord, he is then safe, and there is no more difficulty.</p>
<p>If one returns to his original, natural tendency in the human form of life by understanding the perfect knowledge given by Krsna Himself in the Vedic literature, one’s life is successful.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The fruitive activities a living being performs, whether pious or impious, are the unseen cause for the fulfillment of his desires.</p>
<p>This unseen cause is the root for the living entity’s different bodies.</p>
<p>Because of his intense desire, the living entity takes birth in a particular family and receives a body which is either like that of his mother or like that of his father.</p>
<p>The gross and subtle bodies are created according to his desire.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The gross body is a product of the subtle body.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.6):</p>
<p>yam yam vapi smaran bhavam</p>
<p>tyajaty ante kalevaram</p>
<p>tam tam evaiti kaunteya</p>
<p>sada tad-bhava-bhavitah</p>
<p>Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits his body, that state he will attain without fail The atmosphere of the subtle body at the time of death is created by the activities of the gross body.</p>
<p>Thus the gross body acts during one’s lifetime, and the subtle body acts at the time of death.</p>
<p>The subtle body, which is called linga, the body of desire, is the background for the development of a particular type of gross body, which is either like that of one’s mother or like that of one’s father.</p>
<p>According to the Rg Veda, if at the time of sex the secretions of the mother are more profuse than those of the father, the child will receive a female body, and if the secretions of the father are more profuse than those of the mother, the child will receive a male body.</p>
<p>These are the subtle laws of nature, which act according to the desire of the living entity.</p>
<p>If a human being is taught to change his subtle body by developing a consciousness of Krsna, at the time of death the subtle body will create a gross body in which he will be a devotee of Krsna, or if he is still more perfect, he will not take another material body but will immediately get a spiritual body and thus return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the process of the transmigration of the soul.</p>
<p>Therefore instead of trying to unite human society through pacts for sense gratification that can never be achieved, it is clearly desirable to teach people how to become Krsna conscious and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is true now and, indeed, at any time.</p>

<p>isa-sangad viliyate</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>esah—this; prakrti-sangena—because of association with the material nature; purusasya—of the living entity; viparyayah—a situation of forgetfulness or an awkward position; asit—came to be; sah—that position; eva—indeed; na—not; cirat—taking a long time; isa-sangat—from the association of the Supreme Lord; viliyate—is vanquished.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Since the living entity is associated with material nature, he is in an awkward position, but if in the human form of life he is taught how to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, this position can be overcome.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word prakrti means material nature, and purusa may also refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>If one wants to continue his association with prakrti, the female energy of Krsna, and be separated from Krsna by the illusion that he is able to enjoy prakrti, he must continue in his conditional life.</p>
<p>If he changes his consciousness, however, and associates with the supreme, original person (purusam sasvatam), or with His associates, he can get out of the entanglement of material nature.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), janma karma ca me divyam evam yo vetti tattvatah: one must simply understand the Supreme Person, Krsna, in terms of His form, name, activities and pastimes.</p>
<p>This will keep one always in the association of Krsna.</p>
<p>Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti so’rjuna: (Bg.4.9) thus after giving up his gross material body, one accepts not another gross body but a spiritual body in which to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus one ends the tribulation caused by his association with the material energy.</p>
<p>In summary, the living entity is an eternal servant of God, but he comes to the material world and is bound by material conditions because of his desire to lord it over matter.</p>
<p>Liberation means giving up this false consciousness and reviving one’s original service to the Lord.</p>
<p>This return to one’s original life is called mukti, as confirmed in Srimad-Bhagavatam (muktir hitvanyatha rupam svarupena vyavasthitih).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning this brahmana named Ajamila studied all the Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>He was a reservoir of good character, good conduct and good qualities.</p>
<p>Firmly established in executing all the Vedic injunctions, he was very mild and gentle, and he kept his mind and senses under control.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he was always truthful, he knew how to chant the Vedic mantras, and he was also very pure.</p>
<p>Ajamila was very respectful to his spiritual master, the fire-god, guests, and the elderly members of his household.</p>

<p>He was upright, benevolent to all living entities, and well behaved.</p>
<p>He would never speak nonsense or envy anyone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The order carriers of Yamaraja, the Yamadutas, are explaining the factual position of piety and impiety and how a living entity is entangled in this material world.</p>

<p>He was well behaved, neat and clean, and very kind to everyone.</p>
<p>In fact, he had all good qualities.</p>
<p>In other words, he was like a perfect brahmana.</p>
<p>A brahmana is expected to be perfectly pious, to follow all the regulative principles and to have all good qualities.</p>
<p>The symptoms of piety are explained in these verses.</p>
<p>Srila Viraraghava Acarya comments that dhrta-vrata means dhrtam vratam stri-sanga-rahityatmaka-brahmacarya-rupam.</p>
<p>In other words, Ajamila followed the rules and regulations of celibacy as a perfect brahmacari and was very softhearted, truthful, clean and pure.</p>
<p>How he fell down in spite of all these qualities and thus came to be threatened with punishment by Yamaraja will be described in the following verses.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Once this brahmana Ajamila, following the order of his father, went to the forest to collect fruit, flowers and two kinds of grass, called samit and kusa.</p>
<p>On the way home, he came upon a sudra, a very lusty, fourth-class man, who was shamelessly embracing and kissing a prostitute.</p>
<p>The sudra was smiling, singing and enjoying as if this were proper behavior.</p>
<p>Both the sudra and the prostitute were drunk.</p>
<p>The prostitute’s eyes were rolling in intoxication, and her dress had become loose.</p>
<p>Such was the condition in which Ajamila saw them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>While traveling along the public way, Ajamila came upon a fourth-class man and a prostitute, who are vividly described here.</p>
<p>Drunkenness was sometimes manifest even in bygone ages, although not very frequently.</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, however, such sin is to be seen everywhere, for people all over the world have become shameless.</p>
<p>Long ago, when he saw the scene of the drunken sudra and the prostitute, Ajamila, who was a perfect brahmacari, was affected.</p>
<p>Nowadays such sin is visible in so many places, and we must consider the position of a brahmacari student who sees such behavior.</p>
<p>For such a brahmacari to remain steady is very difficult unless he is extremely strong in following the regulative principles.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if one takes to Krsna consciousness very seriously, he can withstand the provocation created by sin.</p>
<p>In our Krsna consciousness movement we prohibit illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, a drunk, half-naked woman embracing a drunk man is a very common sight, especially in the Western countries, and restraining oneself after seeing such things is very difficult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if by the grace of Krsna one adheres to the regulative principles and chants the Hare Krsna mantra, Krsna will certainly protect him.</p>
<p>Indeed, Krsna says that His devotee is never vanquished (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati).</p>
<p>Therefore all the disciples practicing Krsna consciousness should obediently follow the regulative principles and remain fixed in chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then there need be no fear.</p>
<p>Otherwise one’s position is very dangerous, especially in this Kali-yuga.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By speaking this verse, Sukadeva Gosvami wants to impress upon the mind of the reader that Ajamila’s exalted position as a brahmana was vanquished by his association with the prostitute, so much so that he forgot all his brahminical activities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at the end of his life, by chanting the four syllables of the name Narayana, he was saved from the gravest danger of falling down.</p>
<p>Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: even a little devotional service can save one from the greatest danger.</p>
<p>Devotional service, which begins with chanting of the holy name of the Lord, is so powerful that even if one falls down from the exalted position of a brahmana through sexual indulgence, he can be saved from all calamities if he somehow or other chants the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is the extraordinary power of the Lord’s holy name.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhagavad-gita it is advised that one not forget the chanting of the holy name even for a moment (satatam kirtayanto mam yatantas ca drdha-vratah (Bg.9.14)).</p>
<p>There are so many dangers in this material world that one may fall down from an exalted position at any time.</p>

<p>This man Ajamila did not undergo atonement.</p>
<p>Therefore because of his sinful life, we must take him into the presence of Yamaraja for punishment.</p>
<p>There, according to the extent of his sinful acts, he will be punished and thus purified.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Visnudutas had forbidden the Yamadutas to take Ajamila to Yamaraja, and therefore the Yamadutas explained that taking such a man to Yamaraja was appropriate.</p>
<p>Since Ajamila had not undergone atonement for his sinful acts, he was to be taken to Yamaraja to be purified.</p>
<p>When a man commits murder he becomes sinful, and therefore he also must be killed; otherwise after death he must suffer many sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Similarly, punishment by Yamaraja is a process of purification for the most abominable sinful persons.</p>
<p>Therefore the Yamadutas requested the Visnudutas not to obstruct their taking Ajamila to Yamaraja.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#ajamila-delivered-by-the-visnudutas" id="ajamila-delivered-by-the-visnudutas">Ajamila Delivered by the Visnudutas</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#62" id="62">6.2</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter the messengers from Vaikuntha explain to the Yamadutas the glories of chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Visnudutas said, Now impious acts are being performed even in an assembly of devotees, for a person who is not punishable is going to be punished in the assembly of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>The mass of people are helpless and must depend upon the government for their safety and security, but if the government takes advantage of this to harm the citizens, where will they go? We see perfectly that Ajamila should not be punished, although you are attempting to take him to Yamaraja for punishment It was due to Ajamila’s glorifying the holy name of the Supreme Lord that he was not punishable.</p>
<p>The Visnudutas explained this as follows: Simply by once chanting the holy name of Narayana, this brahmana has become free from the reactions of sinful life.</p>
<p>Indeed, he has been freed not only from the sins of this life, but from the sins of many, many thousands of other lives.</p>
<p>He has already undergone true atonement for all his sinful actions.</p>
<p>If one atones according to the directions of the sastras, one does not actually become free from sinful reactions, but if one chants the holy name of the Lord, even a glimpse of such chanting can immediately free one from all sins.</p>
<p>Chanting the glories of the Lord’s holy name awakens all good fortune.</p>
<p>Therefore there is no doubt that Ajamila, being completely free from all sinful reactions, should not be punished by Yamaraja As they were saying this, the Visnudutas released Ajamila from the ropes of the Yamadutas and left for their own abode.</p>
<p>The brahmana Ajamila, however, offered his respectful obeisances to the Visnudutas.</p>
<p>He could understand how fortunate he was to have chanted the holy name of Narayana at the end of his life.</p>
<p>Indeed, he could realize the full significance of this good fortune.</p>
<p>Having thoroughly understood the discussion between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas, he became a pure devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He lamented very much for how very sinful he had been, and he condemned himself again and again.</p>
<p>Finally, because of his association with the Visnudutas, Ajamila, his original consciousness aroused, gave up everything and went to Hardwar, where he engaged in devotional service without deviation, always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus the Visnudutas went there, seated him on a golden throne and took him away to Vaikunthaloka.</p>
<p>In summary, although the sinful Ajamila meant to call his son, the holy name of Lord Narayana, even though chanted in the preliminary stage, namabhasa, was able to give him liberation.</p>
<p>Therefore one who chants the holy name of the Lord with faith and devotion is certainly exalted.</p>
<p>He is protected even in his material, conditional life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Visnudutas said: Alas, how painful it is that irreligion is being introduced into an assembly where religion should be maintained.</p>
<p>Indeed, those in charge of maintaining the religious principles are needlessly punishing a sinless, unpunishable person.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Visnudutas accused the Yamadutas of violating the religious principles by attempting to drag Ajamila to Yamaraja for punishment.</p>
<p>Yamaraja is the officer appointed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to judge religious and irreligious principles and to punish people who are irreligious.</p>
<p>However, if completely sinless people are punished, the entire assembly of Yamaraja is contaminated.</p>
<p>This principle applies not only in the assembly of Yamaraja, but throughout human society also.</p>
<p>In human society, properly maintaining religious principles is the duty of the king’s court or the government.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this yuga, Kali-yuga, the religious principles are tampered with, and the government cannot properly judge who is to be punished and who is not.</p>
<p>It is said that in the Kali-yuga if one cannot spend money in court, one cannot get justice.</p>
<p>Indeed, in courts of justice it is often found that magistrates are bribed for favorable judgments.</p>
<p>Sometimes religious men who preach the Krsna consciousness movement for the benefit of the entire populace are arrested and harassed by the police and courts.</p>
<p>The Visnudutas, who are Vaisnavas, lamented for these very regrettable facts.</p>
<p>Because of their spiritual compassion for all the fallen souls, Vaisnavas go out to preach according to the standard method of all religious principles, but unfortunately, because of the influence of Kali-yuga, Vaisnavas who have dedicated their lives to preaching the glories of the Lord are sometimes harassed and punished by courts on false charges of disturbing the peace.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A king or governmental official should be so well qualified that he acts as a father, maintainer and protector of the citizens because of affection and love.</p>
<p>He should give the citizens good advice and instructions according to the standard scriptures and should be equal to everyone.</p>
<p>Yamaraja does this, for he is the supreme master of justice, and so do those who follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>However, if such persons become polluted and exhibit partiality by punishing an innocent, blameless person, where will the citizens go to take shelter for their maintenance and security?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The king, or in modern times the government, should act as the guardian of the citizens by teaching them the proper goal of life.</p>
<p>The human form of life is especially meant for realization of one’s self and one’s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because this cannot be realized in animal life.</p>
<p>The duty of the government, therefore, is to take charge of training all the citizens in such a way that by a gradual process they will be elevated to the spiritual platform and will realize the self and his relationship with God.</p>
<p>This principle was followed by kings like Maharaja Yudhisthira, Maharaja Pariksit, Lord Ramacandra, Maharaja Ambarisa and Prahlada Maharaja.</p>
<p>The leaders of the government must be very honest and religious because otherwise all the affairs of the state will suffer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the name of democracy, rogues and thieves are electing other rogues and thieves to the most important posts in the government.</p>
<p>Recently this has been proven in America, where the president had to be condemned and dragged down from his post by the citizens.</p>
<p>This is only one case, but there are many others.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of the Krsna consciousness movement, people should be Krsna conscious and should not vote for anyone who is not Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Then there will be actual peace and prosperity in the state.</p>
<p>When a Vaisnava sees mismanagement in the government, he feels great compassion in his heart and tries his best to purify the situation by spreading the Hare Krsna movement.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The mass of people follow the example of a leader in society and imitate his behavior.</p>
<p>They accept as evidence whatever the leader accepts.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Ajamila was not punishable, the Yamadutas were insisting on taking him away to Yamaraja for punishment.</p>
<p>This was adharma, contrary to religious principles.</p>
<p>The Visnudutas feared that if such irreligious acts were allowed, the management of human society would be spoiled.</p>
<p>In modern times, the Krsna consciousness movement is trying to introduce the right principles of management for human society, but unfortunately the governments of Kali-yuga do not properly support the Hare Krsna movement because they do not appreciate its valuable service.</p>
<p>The Hare Krsna movement is the right movement for ameliorating the fallen condition of human society, and therefore governments and public leaders in every part of the world should support this movement to completely rectify humanity’s sinful condition.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>People in general are not very advanced in knowledge by which to discriminate between religion and irreligion.</p>
<p>The innocent, unenlightened citizen is like an ignorant animal sleeping in peace with its head on the lap of its master, faithfully believing in the master’s protection.</p>
<p>If a leader is actually kindhearted and deserves to be the object of a living entity’s faith, how can he punish or kill a foolish person who has fully surrendered in good faith and friendship?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Sanskrit word visvasta-ghata refers to one who breaks faith or causes a breach of trust.</p>
<p>The mass of people should always feel security because of the government’s protection.</p>
<p>Therefore, how regrettable it is for the government itself to cause a breach of trust and put the citizens in difficulty for political reasons.</p>
<p>We actually saw during the partition days in India that although Hindus and Muslims were living together peacefully, manipulation by politicians suddenly aroused feelings of hatred between them, and thus the Hindus and Muslims killed one another over politics.</p>
<p>This is a sign of Kali-yuga.</p>
<p>In this age, animals are kept nicely sheltered, completely confident that their masters will protect them, but unfortunately as soon as the animals are fat, they are immediately sent for slaughter.</p>
<p>Such cruelty is condemned by Vaisnavas like the Visnudutas.</p>
<p>Indeed, the hellish conditions already described await the sinful men responsible for such suffering.</p>
<p>One who betrays the confidence of a living entity who takes shelter of him in good faith, whether that living entity be a human being or an animal, is extremely sinful.</p>
<p>Because such betrayals now go unpunished by the government, all of human society is terribly contaminated.</p>
<p>The people of this age are therefore described as mandah sumanda-matayo manda-bhagya hy upadrutah (SB 1.1.10).</p>
<p>As a consequence of such sinfulness, men are condemned (mandah), their intelligence is unclear (sumanda-matayah), they are unfortunate (manda-bhagyah), and therefore they are always disturbed by many problems (upadrutah).</p>
<p>This is their situation in this life, and after death they are punished in hellish conditions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Ajamila has already atoned for all his sinful actions.</p>
<p>Indeed, he has atoned not only for sins performed in one life but for those performed in millions of lives, for in a helpless condition he chanted the holy name of Narayana.</p>
<p>Even though he did not chant purely, he chanted without offense, and therefore he is now pure and eligible for liberation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Yamadutas had considered only the external situation of Ajamila.</p>
<p>Since he was extremely sinful throughout his life, they thought he should be taken to Yamaraja and did not know that he had become free from the reactions of all his sins.</p>
<p>The Visnudutas therefore instructed that because he had chanted the four syllables of the name Narayana at the time of his death, he was freed from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes the following verses from the smrti-sastra:</p>
<p>namno hi yavati saktih</p>
<p>papa-nirharane hareh</p>
<p>tavat kartum na saknoti</p>
<p>patakam pataki narah</p>
<p>Simply by chanting one holy name of Hari, a sinful man can counteract the reactions to more sins than he is able to commit (Brhad-visnu Purana)</p>
<p>avasenapi yan-namni</p>
<p>kirtite sarva-patakaih</p>
<p>puman vimucyate sadyah</p>

<p>baddha-parikaras tena</p>
<p>moksaya gamanam prati</p>
<p>By once chanting the holy name of the Lord, which consists of the two syllables ha-ri, one guarantees his path to liberation (Skanda Purana) These are some of the reasons why the Visnudutas objected to the Yamadutas’ taking Ajamila to the court of Yamaraja.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Visnudutas continued: Even previously, while eating and at other times, this Ajamila would call his son, saying, My dear Narayana, please come here Although calling the name of his son, he nevertheless uttered the four syllables na-ra-ya-na.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the name of Narayana in this way, he sufficiently atoned for the sinful reactions of millions of lives.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Previously, when engaged in sinful activities to maintain his family, Ajamila chanted the name of Narayana without offenses.</p>
<p>To chant the holy name of the Lord just to counteract one’s sinful activities, or to commit sinful activities on the strength of chanting the holy name, is offensive (namno balad yasya hi papa-buddhih).</p>
<p>But although Ajamila engaged in sinful activities, he never chanted the holy name of Narayana to counteract them; he simply chanted the name Narayana to call his son.</p>
<p>Therefore his chanting was effective.</p>
<p>Because of chanting the holy name of Narayana in this way, he had already vanquished the accumulated sinful reactions of many, many lives.</p>
<p>In the beginning he was pure, but although he later committed many sinful acts, he was offenseless because he did not chant the holy name of Narayana to counteract them.</p>
<p>One who always chants the holy name of the Lord without offenses is always pure.</p>
<p>As confirmed in this verse Ajamila was already sinless, and because he chanted the name of Narayana he remained sinless.</p>
<p>It did not matter that he was calling his son; the name itself was effective.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By following the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies or undergoing atonement, sinful men do not become as purified as by chanting once the holy name of Lord Hari.</p>
<p>Although ritualistic atonement may free one from sinful reactions, it does not awaken devotional service, unlike the chanting of the Lord’s names, which reminds one of the Lord’s fame, qualities, attributes, pastimes and paraphernalia.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that the chanting of the holy name of the Lord has special significance that distinguishes it from the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of atonement for severe, more severe or most severe sinful actions.</p>
<p>There are twenty types of religious scriptures called dharma-sastras, beginning with the Manu-samhita and parasara-samhita, but herein it is stressed that although one may become free from the reactions of the most sinful activities by following the religious principles of these scriptures, this cannot promote a sinful man to the stage of loving service to the Lord.</p>
<p>On the other hand, chanting the holy name of the Lord even once not only frees one immediately from the reactions of the greatest sins, but also raises one to the platform of rendering loving service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described as uttamasloka because He is famous for His glorious activities.</p>
<p>Thus one serves the Lord by remembering His form, His attributes and pastimes.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura explains that this is all possible simply by chanting the Lord’s holy name because of the Lord’s omnipotence.</p>
<p>What cannot be achieved through the performance of Vedic rituals can be easily achieved through the chanting of the Lord’s holy name.</p>
<p>To chant the holy name and dance in ecstasy is so easy and sublime that one can achieve all the benefits of spiritual life simply by following this process.</p>
<p>Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu declares, param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam: All glories to Sri Krsna sankirtana The sankirtana movement we have started offers the best process for becoming purified of all sinful reactions and coming immediately to the platform of spiritual life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The ritualistic ceremonies of atonement recommended in the religious scriptures are insufficient to cleanse the heart absolutely because after atonement one’s mind again runs toward material activities.</p>
<p>Consequently, for one who wants liberation from the fruitive reactions of material activities, the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra, or glorification of the name, fame and pastimes of the Lord, is recommended as the most perfect process of atonement because such chanting eradicates the dirt from one’s heart completely.</p>

<p>Therefore simply by such glorification one not only becomes purified, but also achieves the results of pious activities (punya-sravana-kirtana).</p>
<p>Punya-sravana-kirtana refers to the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>Even if one does not understand the meaning of the Lord’s name, pastimes or attributes, one is purified simply by hearing or chanting of them.</p>
<p>Such purification is called sattva-bhavana.</p>
<p>One’s main purpose in human life should be to purify his existence and achieve liberation.</p>
<p>As long as one has a material body, one is understood to be impure.</p>
<p>In such an impure, material condition, one cannot enjoy a truly blissful life, although everyone seeks it.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (5.5.1) says, tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam suddhyet: one must perform tapasya, austerity, to purify his existence in order to come to the spiritual platform.</p>
<p>The tapasya of chanting and glorifying the name, fame and attributes of the Lord is a very easy purifying process by which everyone can be happy.</p>
<p>Therefore everyone who desires the ultimate cleansing of his heart must adopt this process.</p>
<p>Other processes, such as karma, jnana and yoga, cannot cleanse the heart absolutely.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>At the time of death, this Ajamila helplessly and very loudly chanted the holy name of the Lord, Narayana.</p>
<p>That chanting alone has already freed him from the reactions of all sinful life.</p>
<p>Therefore, O servants of Yamaraja, do not try to take him to your master for punishment in hellish conditions.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Visnudutas, who are superior authorities, gave orders to the Yamadutas, who did not know that Ajamila was no longer subject to tribulation in hellish life for his past sins.</p>
<p>Although he had chanted the holy name Narayana to indicate his son, the holy name is so transcendentally powerful that he was automatically freed because he had chanted the holy name while dying (ante narayana-smrtih).</p>

<p>anta-kale ca mam eva</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes an incident that took place when Samba was rescued from the punishment of the Kauravas.</p>
<p>Samba fell in love with the daughter of Duryodhana, and since according to ksatriya custom one is not offered a ksatriya’s daughter unless he displays his chivalrous valor, Samba abducted her.</p>
<p>Consequently Samba was arrested by the Kauravas.</p>
<p>Later, when Lord Balarama came to rescue him, there was an argument about Samba’s release.</p>
<p>Since the argument was not settled, Balarama showed His power in such a way that all of Hastinapura trembled and would have been vanquished as if by a great earthquake.</p>
<p>Then the matter was settled, and Samba married Duryodhana’s daughter.</p>
<p>The purport is that one should take shelter of Krsna-Balarama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose protective power is so great that it cannot be equaled in the material world.</p>
<p>However powerful the reactions of one’s sins, they will immediately be vanquished if one chants the name of Hari, Krsna, Balarama or Narayana.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Although one may neutralize the reactions of sinful life through austerity, charity, vows and other such methods, these pious activities cannot uproot the material desires in one’s heart.</p>
<p>However, if one serves the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, he is immediately freed from all such contaminations.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.42), bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca: devotional service is so powerful that one who performs devotional service is immediately freed from all sinful desires.</p>
<p>All desires within this material world are sinful because material desire means sense gratification, which always involves action that is more or less sinful.</p>
<p>Pure bhakti, however, is anyabhilasita-sunya; in other words, it is free from material desires, which result from karma and jnana.</p>
<p>One who is situated in devotional service no longer has material desires, and therefore he is beyond sinful life.</p>
<p>Material desires should be completely stopped.</p>
<p>Otherwise, although one’s austerities, penances and charity may free one from sin for the time being, one’s desires will reappear because his heart is impure.</p>
<p>Thus he will act sinfully and suffer.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If a person unaware of the effective potency of a certain medicine takes that medicine or is forced to take it, it will act even without his knowledge because its potency does not depend on the patient’s understanding.</p>
<p>Similarly, even though one does not know the value of chanting the holy name of the Lord, if one chants knowingly or unknowingly, the chanting will be very effective.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Western countries, where the Hare Krsna movement is spreading, learned scholars and other thoughtful men are realizing its effectiveness.</p>
<p>For example, Dr.</p>
<p>Stillson Judah, a learned scholar, has been very much attracted to this movement because he has actually seen that it is turning hippies addicted to drugs into pure Vaisnavas who voluntarily become servants of Krsna and humanity.</p>
<p>Even a few years ago, such hippies did not know the Hare Krsna mantra, but now they are chanting it and becoming pure Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Thus they are becoming free from all sinful activities, such as illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling.</p>
<p>This is practical proof of the effectiveness of the Hare Krsna movement, which is supported in this verse.</p>
<p>One may or may not know the value of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra, but if one somehow or other chants it, he will immediately be purified, just as one who takes a potent medicine will feel its effects, regardless of whether he takes it knowingly or unknowingly.</p>

<p>Because Ajamila was now free from all sinful reactions, his lifetime was extended, even though he was to have died immediately.</p>
<p>When the Visnudutas saw Ajamila trying to say something to them, they disappeared to give him a chance to glorify the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Since all his sinful reactions had been vanquished, he was now prepared to glorify the Lord.</p>
<p>Indeed, one cannot glorify the Lord unless one is completely free from all sinful activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After hearing the discourses between the Yamadutas and the Visnudutas, Ajamila could understand the religious principles that act under the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>These principles are mentioned in the three Vedas.</p>
<p>He could also understand the transcendental religious principles, which are above the modes of material nature and which concern the relationship between the living being and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Ajamila heard glorification of the name, fame, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He thus became a perfectly pure devotee.</p>
<p>He could then remember his past sinful activities, which he greatly regretted having performed.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (2.45) Lord Krsna told Arjuna:</p>
<p>traigunya-visaya veda</p>
<p>nistraigunyo bhavarjuna</p>
<p>nirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho</p>
<p>niryoga-ksema atmavan</p>
<p>The Vedas mainly deal with the subject of the three modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Rise above these modes, O Arjuna.</p>
<p>Be transcendental to all of them.</p>
<p>Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be established in the Self The Vedic principles certainly prescribe a gradual process for rising to the spiritual platform, but if one remains attached to the Vedic principles, there is no chance of his being elevated to spiritual life.</p>
<p>Krsna therefore advised Arjuna to perform devotional service, which is the process of transcendental religion.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.6).</p>
<p>Sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje.</p>
<p>Bhakti, devotional service, is paro dharmah, transcendental dharma; it is not material dharma.</p>
<p>People generally think that religion should be pursued for material profit.</p>
<p>This may be suitable for persons interested in material life, but one who is interested in spiritual life should be attached to paro dharmah, the religious principles by which one becomes a devotee of the Supreme Lord (yato bhaktir adhoksaje).</p>
<p>The bhagavata religion teaches that the Lord and the living entity are eternally related and that the duty of the living entity is to surrender to the Lord.</p>
<p>When one is situated on the platform of devotional service, one is freed from impediments and completely satisfied (ahaituky apratihata yayatma suprasidati).</p>
<p>Having been elevated to that platform, Ajamila began to lament for his past materialistic activities and glorify the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>Ajamila said: Alas, being a servant of my senses, how degraded I became! I fell down from my position as a duly qualified brahmana and begot children in the womb of a prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The men of the higher classes—the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas—do not beget children in the wombs of lower-class women.</p>
<p>Therefore the custom in Vedic society is to examine the horoscopes of a girl and boy being considered for marriage to see whether their combination is suitable.</p>
<p>Vedic astrology reveals whether one has been born in the vipra-varna, ksatriya-varna, vaisya-varna or sudra-varna, according to the three qualities of material nature.</p>
<p>This must be examined because a marriage between a boy of the vipra-varna and a girl of the sudra-varna is incompatible; married life would be miserable for both husband and wife.</p>
<p>Consequently a boy should marry a girl of the same category.</p>
<p>Of course, this is trai-gunya, a material calculation according to the Vedas, but if the boy and girl are devotees there need be no such considerations.</p>
<p>A devotee is transcendental, and therefore in a marriage between devotees, the boy and girl form a very happy combination.</p>

<p>This is the duty of everyone, especially an upper-class person.</p>
<p>Because of his association with a prostitute, Ajamila abandoned all his duties.</p>

<p>I am certainly most abominable and unfortunate to have merged in an ocean of sinful activities, but nevertheless, because of my previous spiritual activities, I could see those four exalted personalities who came to rescue me.</p>
<p>Now I feel exceedingly happy because of their visit.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya22.54):</p>
<p>’sadhu-sanga’, ’sadhu-sanga’——sarva-sastre kaya</p>
<p>lava-matra sadhu-sange sarva-siddhi haya</p>
<p>Association with devotees is recommended by all the sastras because by even a moment of such association one can receive the seed for all perfection In the beginning of his life Ajamila was certainly very pure, and he associated with devotees and brahmanas; because of that pious activity, even though he was fallen, he was inspired to name his son Narayana.</p>
<p>Certainly this was due to good counsel given from within by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness The Lord, who is situated in everyone’s heart, is so kind that if one has ever rendered service to Him, the Lord never forgets him.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord, from within, gave Ajamila the opportunity to name his youngest son Narayana so that in affection he would constantly call Narayana! Narayana and thus be saved from the most fearful and dangerous condition at the time of his death.</p>
<p>Such is the mercy of Krsna.</p>
<p>Guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija: by the mercy of the guru and Krsna, one receives the seed of bhakti.</p>
<p>This association saves a devotee from the greatest fear.</p>
<p>In our Krsna consciousness movement we therefore change a devotee’s name to a form that reminds him of Visnu.</p>
<p>If at the time of death the devotee can remember his own name, such as Krsnadasa or Govinda dasa, he can be saved from the greatest danger.</p>
<p>Therefore the change of names at the time of initiation is essential.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is so meticulous that it gives one a good opportunity to remember Krsna somehow or other.</p>

<p>The name Vaikunthapati, which means the master of the spiritual world is not different from the name Vaikuntha.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Those engaged in broadcasting the holy name of Narayana, Krsna, through the Krsna consciousness movement should always consider what our position was before we came and what it is now.</p>
<p>We had fallen into abominable lives as meat-eaters, drunkards and woman hunters who performed all kinds of sinful activities, but now we have been given the opportunity to chant the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>Therefore we should always appreciate this opportunity.</p>
<p>By the grace of the Lord we are opening many branches, and we should use this good fortune to chant the holy name of the Lord and serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly.</p>
<p>We must be conscious of the difference between our present and past conditions and should always be very careful not to fall from the most exalted life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of identifying oneself with the body, one is subjected to desires for sense gratification, and thus one engages in many different types of pious and impious action.</p>
<p>This is what constitutes material bondage.</p>
<p>Now I shall disentangle myself from my material bondage, which has been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s illusory energy in the form of a woman.</p>
<p>Being a most fallen soul, I was victimized by the illusory energy and have become like a dancing dog led around by a woman’s hand.</p>
<p>Now I shall give up all lusty desires and free myself from this illusion.</p>
<p>I shall become a merciful, well-wishing friend to all living entities and always absorb myself in Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p>That is the sum and substance of the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>Everyone is like a play toy in the hands of the illusory energy and is acting as she moves him.</p>
<p>One should come to Krsna consciousness to release oneself and also to release others.</p>

<p>Simply because I chanted the holy name of the Lord in the association of devotees, my heart is now becoming purified.</p>
<p>Therefore I shall not fall victim again to the false lures of material sense gratification.</p>
<p>Now that I have become fixed in the Absolute Truth, henceforward I shall not identify myself with the body.</p>
<p>I shall give up false conceptions of  and min and fix my mind on the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>How a living entity becomes a victim of the material condition is lucidly explained in this verse.</p>
<p>The beginning is to misidentify the body as one’s self.</p>
<p>Therefore Bhagavad-gita begins with the spiritual instruction that one is not the body, but is within the body.</p>
<p>This consciousness can be possible only if one chants the holy name of Krsna, the Hare Krsna maha-mantra, and always keeps oneself in the association of devotees.</p>
<p>This is the secret of success.</p>
<p>Therefore we stress that one should chant the holy name of the Lord and keep oneself free from the contaminations of this material world, especially the contaminations of lusty desires for illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling.</p>
<p>With determination, one should vow to follow these principles and thus be saved from the miserable condition of material existence.</p>
<p>The first necessity is to become freed from the bodily concept of life.</p>

<p>Thus freed from all material attraction, he immediately started for Hardwar.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word mukta-sarvanubandhanah indicates that after this incident, Ajamila, not caring for his wife and children, went straight to Hardwar for further advancement in his spiritual life.</p>
<p>Our Krsna consciousness movement now has centers in Vrndavana and Navadvipa so that those who want to live a retired life, whether they be devotees or not, can go there and with determination give up the bodily concept of life.</p>
<p>One is welcome to live in those holy places for the rest of his life in order to achieve the highest success by the very simple method of chanting the holy name of the Lord and taking prasada.</p>
<p>Thus one may return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>We do not have a center in Hardwar, but Vrndavana and Sridhama Mayapur are better for devotees than any other places.</p>
<p>The Caitanya Candrodaya temple offers one a good opportunity to associate with devotees.</p>

<p>Ajamila fully engaged in devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he detached his mind from the process of sense gratification and became fully absorbed in thinking of the form of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If one worships the Deity in the temple, one’s mind will naturally be absorbed in thought of the Lord and His form.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between the form of the Lord and the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Therefore bhakti-yoga is the most easy system of yoga.</p>
<p>Yogis try to concentrate their minds upon the form of the Supersoul, Visnu, within the heart, but this same objective is easily achieved when one’s mind is absorbed in the Deity worshiped in the temple.</p>
<p>In every temple there is a transcendental form of the Lord, and one may easily think of this form.</p>
<p>By seeing the Lord during arati, by offering bhoga and by constantly thinking of the form of the Deity, one becomes a first-class yogi.</p>
<p>This is the best process of yoga, as confirmed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Bhagavad-gita (6.47):</p>
<p>yoginam api sarvesam</p>
<p>mad-gatenantaratmana</p>
<p>sraddhavan bhajate yo mam</p>
<p>sa me yuktatamo matah</p>
<p>Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all The first-class yogi is he who controls his senses and detaches himself from material activities by always thinking of the form of the Lord.</p>

<p>Thus he was destined to be carried away to hell by the order carriers of Yamaraja, but he was immediately rescued simply by a glimpse of the chanting of the holy name Narayana.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore one who desires freedom from material bondage should adopt the process of chanting and glorifying the name, fame, form and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, at whose feet all the holy places stand.</p>
<p>One cannot derive the proper benefit from other methods, such as pious atonement, speculative knowledge and meditation in mystic yoga, because even after following such methods one takes to fruitive activities again, unable to control his mind, which is contaminated by the base qualities of nature, namely passion and ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It has actually been seen that even after achieving so-called perfection, many karmis, jnanis and yogis become attached to material activities again.</p>
<p>Many so-called svamis and yogis give up material activities as false (jagan mithya), but after some time they nevertheless resume material activities by opening hospitals and schools or performing other activities for the benefit of the public.</p>
<p>Sometimes they participate in politics, although still falsely declaring themselves sannyasis, members of the renounced order.</p>
<p>The perfect conclusion, however, is that if one actually desires to get out of the material world, he must take to devotional service, which begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh: (SB 7.5.23) chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement has actually proved this.</p>
<p>In the Western countries, many young boys who were addicted to drugs and who had many other bad habits, which they could not give up, abandoned all those propensities and very seriously engaged in chanting the glories of the Lord as soon as they joined the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>In other words, this process is the perfect method of atonement for actions performed in rajah and tamah (passion and ignorance).</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.19):</p>
<p>tada rajas-tamo-bhavah</p>
<p>kama-lobhadayas ca ye</p>
<p>ceta etair anaviddham</p>
<p>sthitam sattve prasidati</p>
<p>As a result of rajah and tamah, one becomes increasingly lusty and greedy, but when one takes to the process of chanting and hearing, one comes to the platform of goodness and becomes happy.</p>
<p>As he advances in devotional service, all his doubts are completely eradicated (bhidyate hrdaya-granthis chidyante sarva-samsayah).</p>
<p>Thus the knot of his desire for fruitive activities is cut to pieces.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>While suffering at the time of death, Ajamila chanted the holy name of the Lord, and although the chanting was directed toward his son, he nevertheless returned home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore if one faithfully and inoffensively chants the holy name of the Lord, where is the doubt that he will return to Godhead?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>At the time of death one is certainly bewildered because his bodily functions are in disorder.</p>
<p>At that time, even one who throughout his life has practiced chanting the holy name of the Lord may not be able to chant the Hare Krsna mantra very distinctly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, such a person receives all the benefits of chanting the holy name.</p>
<p>While the body is fit therefore, why should we not chant the holy name of the Lord loudly and distinctly? If one does so, it is quite possible that even at the time of death he will be properly able to chant the holy name of the Lord with love and faith.</p>
<p>In conclusion, one who chants the holy name of the Lord constantly is guaranteed to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Supplementary note to this chapter.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura’s commentary to texts nine and ten of this chapter form a dialogue concerning how one can become free from all sinful reactions simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Someone may say, It may be accepted that by chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes freed from all the reactions of sinful life.</p>
<p>However, if one commits sinful acts in full consciousness, not only once but many, many times, he is unable to free himself from the reactions of such sins even after atoning for them for twelve years or more.</p>
<p>How is it possible, then, that simply by once chanting the holy name of the Lord one immediately becomes freed from the reactions of such sins Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura replies by quoting verses nine and ten of this chapter: The chanting of the holy name of Lord Visnu is the best process of atonement for a thief of gold or other valuables, for a drunkard, for one who betrays a friend or relative, for one who kills a brahmana, or for one who indulges in sex with the wife of his guru or another superior.</p>
<p>It is also the best method of atonement for one who murders women, the king or his father, for one who slaughters cows, and for all other sinful men.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the holy name of Lord Visnu, such sinful persons may attract the attention of the Supreme Lord, who therefore considers Because this man has chanted My holy name, My duty is to give him protection.’ One may atone for sinful life and vanquish all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name, although this is not called atonement.</p>
<p>Ordinary atonement may temporarily protect a sinful person, but it does not completely cleanse his heart of the deep-rooted desire to commit sinful acts.</p>
<p>Therefore atonement is not as powerful as the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the sastras it is said that if a person only once chants the holy name and completely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord immediately considers him His ward and is always inclined to give him protection.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Sridhara Svami.</p>
<p>Thus when Ajamila was in great danger of being carried off by the order carriers of Yamaraja, the Lord immediately sent His personal order carriers to protect him, and because Ajamila was freed from all sinful reactions, the Visnudutas spoke on his behalf.</p>
<p>Ajamila had named his son Narayana, and because he loved the boy very much, he would call him again and again.</p>
<p>Although he was calling for his son, the name itself was powerful because the name Narayana is not different from the Supreme Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>When Ajamila named his son Narayana, all the reactions of his sinful life were neutralized, and as he continued calling his son and thus chanting the holy name of Narayana thousands of times, he was actually unconsciously advancing in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>One may argue, Since he was constantly chanting the name of Narayana, how was it possible for him to be associating with a prostitute and thinking of wine By his sinful actions he was bringing suffering upon himself again and again, and therefore one may say that his ultimate chanting of Narayana was the cause of his being freed.</p>
<p>However, his chanting would then have been a nama-aparadha.</p>
<p>Namno balad yasya hi papa-buddhih: one who continues to act sinfully and tries to neutralize his sins by chanting the holy name of the Lord is a nama-aparadhi, an offender to the holy name.</p>
<p>In response it may be said that Ajamila’s chanting was inoffensive because he did not chant the name of Narayana with the purpose of counteracting his sins.</p>
<p>He did not know that he was addicted to sinful actions, nor did he know that his chanting of the name of Narayana was neutralizing them.</p>
<p>Thus he did not commit a nama-aparadha, and his repeated chanting of the holy name of Narayana while calling his son may be called pure chanting.</p>
<p>Because of this pure chanting, Ajamila unconsciously accumulated the results of bhakti.</p>
<p>Indeed, even his first utterance of the holy name was sufficient to nullify all the sinful reactions of his life.</p>
<p>To cite a logical example, a fig tree does not immediately yield fruits, but in time the fruits are available.</p>
<p>Similarly, Ajamila’s devotional service grew little by little, and therefore although he committed very sinful acts, the reactions did not affect him.</p>
<p>In the sastras it is said that if one chants the holy name of the Lord even once, the reactions of past, present or future sinful life do not affect him.</p>
<p>To give another example, if one extracts the poison fangs of a serpent, this saves the serpent’s future victims from poisonous effects, even if the serpent bites repeatedly.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a devotee chants the holy name even once inoffensively, this protects him eternally.</p>
<p>He need only wait for the results of the chanting to mature in due course of time.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-2" id="summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#63" id="63">6.3</a></h3>
<p>As related in this chapter, the Yamadutas approached Yamaraja, who very exhaustively explained bhagavata-dharma, the religious principle of devotional service.</p>
<p>Yamaraja thus satisfied the Yamadutas, who had been very disappointed.</p>
<p>Yamaraja said, Although Ajamila was calling for his son, he chanted the holy name of the Lord, Narayana, and simply by a glimpse of the chanting of the holy name, he immediately achieved the association of Lord Visnu’s order carriers, who saved him from your attempt to arrest him.</p>
<p>This is quite all right.</p>
<p>It is a fact that even a chronically sinful person who chants the holy name of the Lord, although not completely without offenses, does not take another material birth By chanting the holy name of the Lord, Ajamila had met four order carriers of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>They were very beautiful and had quickly come to rescue him.</p>
<p>Yamaraja now described them The Visnudutas are all pure devotees of the Lord, the Supreme Person in regard to the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>Neither King Indra, Varuna, Siva, Brahma, the seven rsis nor I myself can understand the transcendental activities of the Supreme Lord, who is self-sufficient and beyond the reach of the material senses.</p>
<p>With material senses, no one can attain enlightenment about Him.</p>
<p>The Lord, the master of the illusory energy, possesses transcendental qualities for the good fortune of everyone, and His devotees are also qualified in that way.</p>
<p>The devotees, concerned only with rescuing the fallen souls from this material world, apparently take birth in different places in the material world just to save the conditioned souls.</p>
<p>If one is somewhat interested in spiritual life, the devotees of the Lord protect him in many ways Yamaraja continued, The essence of sanatana-dharma, or eternal religion, is extremely confidential.</p>
<p>No one but the Lord Himself can deliver that confidential religious system to human society.</p>
<p>It is by the mercy of the Lord that the transcendental system of religion can be understood by His pure devotees, and specifically by the twelve mahajanas—Lord Brahma, Narada Muni, Lord Siva, the Kumaras, Kapila, Manu, Prahlada, Janaka, Bhisma, Bali, Sukadeva Gosvami and me.</p>
<p>Other learned scholars, headed by Jaimini, are almost always covered by the illusory energy, and therefore they are more or less attracted by the flowery language of the three Vedas, namely Rg, Yajur and Sama, which are called trayi.</p>
<p>Instead of becoming pure devotees, people captivated by the flowery words of these three Vedas are interested in the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.</p>
<p>They cannot understand the glories of chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Intelligent persons, however, take to the devotional service of the Lord.</p>
<p>When they chant the holy name of the Lord without offenses, they are no longer subject to my rulings.</p>
<p>If by chance they commit some sinful act, they are protected by the holy name of the Lord because that is where their interest lies.</p>
<p>The four weapons of the Lord, especially the club and the Sudarsana cakra, always protect the devotees.</p>
<p>One who chants, hears or remembers the holy name of the Lord without duplicity, or who prays or offers obeisances to the Lord, becomes perfect, whereas even a learned person may be called to hell if he is bereft of devotional service After Yamaraja thus described the glories of the Lord and His devotees, Sukadeva Gosvami further explained the potency of chanting the holy name and the futility of performing Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and pious activities for atonement.</p>

<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that the Yamadutas, the order carriers of Yamaraja, were so disappointed that they asked their master, almost in great anger, whether there were many masters other than him.</p>

<p>If in this universe there are many rulers and justices who disagree about punishment and reward, their contradictory actions will neutralize each other, and no one will be punished or rewarded.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if their contradictory acts fail to neutralize each other, everyone will have to be both punished and rewarded.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Because the Yamadutas had been unsuccessful in carrying out the order of Yamaraja, they doubted whether Yamaraja actually had the power to punish the sinful.</p>
<p>Although they had gone to arrest Ajamila, following Yamaraja’s order, they found themselves unsuccessful because of the order of some higher authority.</p>
<p>Therefore they were unsure of whether there were many authorities or only one.</p>
<p>If there were many authorities who gave different judgments, which could be contradictory, a person might be wrongly punished or wrongly rewarded, or he might be neither punished nor rewarded.</p>
<p>According to our experience in the material world, a person punished in one court may appeal to another.</p>
<p>Thus the same man may be either punished or rewarded according to different judgments.</p>
<p>However, in the law of nature or the court of the Supreme Personality of Godhead there cannot be such contradictory judgments.</p>
<p>The judges and their judgments must be perfect and free from contradictions.</p>
<p>Actually the position of Yamaraja was very awkward in the case of Ajamila because the Yamadutas were right in attempting to arrest Ajamila, but the Visnudutas had baffled them.</p>
<p>Although Yamaraja, under these circumstances, was accused by both the Visnudutas and the Yamadutas, he is perfect in administering justice because he is empowered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore he will explain what his real position is and how everyone is controlled by the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>In governmental management there may be departmental officials to give justice to different persons, but the law must be one, and that central law must control everyone.</p>

<p>The order carriers of Yamaraja, being very much aggrieved because of their defeat by the four Visnudutas, wanted to bring them before Yamaraja and, if possible, punish them.</p>
<p>Otherwise they desired to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Before pursuing either course, however, they wanted to know about the Visnudutas from Yamaraja, who is also omniscient.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Thus having been questioned, Lord Yamaraja, the supreme controller of the living entities, was very pleased with his order carriers because of hearing from them the holy name of Narayana.</p>
<p>He remembered the lotus feet of the Lord and began to reply.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Yamaraja, the supreme controller of the living entities in terms of their pious and impious activities, was very pleased with his servants because they had chanted the holy name of Narayana in his dominion.</p>
<p>Yamaraja has to deal with men who are all sinful and who can hardly understand Narayana.</p>
<p>Consequently when his order carriers uttered the name of Narayana, he was extremely pleased, for he also is a Vaisnava.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Yamaraja said: My dear servants, you have accepted me as the Supreme, but factually I am not.</p>
<p>Above me, and above all the other demigods, including Indra and Candra, is the one supreme master and controller.</p>
<p>The partial manifestations of His personality are Brahma, Visnu and Siva, who are in charge of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of this universe.</p>
<p>He is like the two threads that form the length and breadth of a woven cloth.</p>
<p>The entire world is controlled by Him just as a bull is controlled by a rope in its nose.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The order carriers of Yamaraja suspected that there was a ruler even above Yamaraja.</p>
<p>To eradicate their doubts, Yamaraja immediately replied, Yes, there is one supreme controller above everything Yamaraja is in charge of some of the moving living entities, namely the human beings, but the animals, who also move, are not under his control.</p>
<p>Only human beings have consciousness of right and wrong, and among them only those who perform sinful activities come under the control of Yamaraja.</p>
<p>Therefore although Yamaraja is a controller, he is only a departmental controller of a few living entities.</p>
<p>There are other demigods who control many other departments, but above them all is one supreme controller, Krsna.</p>
<p>Isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah (Bs.5.1): the supreme controller is Krsna.</p>
<p>Others, who control their own departments in the affairs of the universe, are insignificant in comparison to Krsna, the supreme controller.</p>
<p>Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.7), mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: My dear Dhananjaya (Arjuna), no one is superior to Me Therefore Yamaraja immediately cleared away the doubts of his assistants, the Yamadutas, by confirming that there is a supreme controller above all others.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya explains that the words otam protam refer to the cause of all causes.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is both vertical and horizontal to the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the following verse from the Skanda Purana:</p>
<p>yatha kantha-patah sutra</p>
<p>otah protas ca sa sthitah</p>
<p>evam visnav idam visvam</p>
<p>otam protam ca samsthitam</p>
<p>Like the two threads, horizontal and vertical, of which a quilt is manufactured, Lord Visnu is situated as the vertical and horizontal cause of the cosmic manifestation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just as the driver of a bullock cart ties ropes through the nostrils of his bulls to control them, the Supreme Personality of Godhead binds all men through the ropes of His words in the Vedas, which set forth the names and activities of the distinct orders of human society (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra).</p>
<p>In fear, the members of these orders all worship the Supreme Lord by offering Him presentations according to their respective activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this material world, everyone is conditioned, regardless of who he is.</p>
<p>One may be a human being, a demigod or an animal, tree or plant, but everything is controlled by the laws of nature, and behind this natural control is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Bhagavad-gita (9.10), wherein Krsna says, mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: The material nature is working under My direction and producing all moving and nonmoving beings Thus Krsna is behind the natural machine, which works under His control.</p>
<p>Apart from other living entities, the living being in the human form of body is systematically controlled by the Vedic injunctions in terms of the divisions of varna and asrama.</p>
<p>A human being is expected to follow the rules and regulations of varna and asrama; otherwise he cannot escape punishment by Yamaraja.</p>
<p>The point is that every human being is expected to elevate himself to the position of a brahmana, the most intelligent man, and then one must transcend that position to become a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>This is the perfection of life.</p>
<p>The brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra can elevate themselves by worshiping the Lord according to their activities (sve sve karmany abhiratah samsiddhim labhate narah).</p>
<p>The divisions of varna and asrama are necessary to insure the proper execution of duties and peaceful existence for everyone, but everyone is directed to worship the Supreme Lord, who is all-pervading (yena sarvam idam tatam).</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord exists vertically and horizontally (otam protam), and therefore if one follows the Vedic injunctions by worshiping the Supreme Lord according to one’s ability, his life will be perfect.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.13):</p>
<p>atah pumbhir dvija-srestha</p>
<p>varnasrama-vibhagasah</p>
<p>svanusthitasya dharmasya</p>
<p>samsiddhir hari-tosanam</p>
<p>O best among the twice-born, it is therefore concluded that the highest perfection one can achieve, by discharging his prescribed duties (dharma) according to caste divisions and orders of life, is to please the Lord Hari The varnasrama institution offers the perfect process for making one eligible to return home, back to Godhead, because the aim of every varna and asrama is to please the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>One can please the Lord under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master and if one does so his life is perfect.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is worshipable and everyone worships Him directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Those who worship Him directly get the results of liberation quickly, whereas the liberation of those who serve Him indirectly is delayed.</p>
<p>The words namabhir vaci are very important.</p>
<p>In the varnasrama institution, there are different names—brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmacari, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasi.</p>
<p>The vak, or Vedic injunctions, give directions for all these divisions.</p>
<p>Everyone is expected to offer obeisances to the Supreme Lord and perform duties as indicated in the Vedas.</p>

<p>I, Yamaraja; Indra, the King of heaven; Nirrti; Varuna; Candra, the moon-god; Agni; Lord Siva; Pavana; Lord Brahma; Surya, the sun-god; Visvasu; the eight Vasus; the Sadhyas; the Maruts; the Rudras; the Siddhas; and Marici and the other great rsis engaged in maintaining the departmental affairs of the universe, as well as the best of the demigods headed by Brhaspati, and the great sages headed by Bhrgu are all certainly freed from the influence of the two base material modes of nature, namely passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although we are in the mode of goodness, we cannot understand the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>What, then, is to be said of others, who, under illusion, merely speculate to know God?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The men and other living entities within this cosmic manifestation are controlled by the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>For the living entities controlled by the base qualities of nature, passion and ignorance, there is no possibility of understanding God.</p>
<p>Even those in the mode of goodness, like the many demigods and great rsis described in these verses, cannot understand the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, one who is situated in the devotional service of the Lord is transcendental to all the material qualities.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord personally says that no one can understand Him but the bhaktas, who are transcendental to all material qualities (bhaktya mam abhijanati (Bg.18.55)).</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.9.16):</p>
<p>na hy asya karhicid rajan</p>
<p>puman veda vidhitsitam</p>
<p>yad-vijijnasaya yukta</p>

<p>O King, no one can know the plan of the Lord (Sri Krsna).</p>
<p>Even though great philosophers inquire exhaustively, they are bewildered No one, therefore, can understand God by speculative knowledge.</p>
<p>Indeed, by speculation one will be bewildered (muhyanti).</p>
<p>This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.3):</p>
<p>manusyanam sahasresu</p>
<p>kascid yatati siddhaye</p>
<p>yatatam api siddhanam</p>
<p>kascin mam vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>Among many thousands of men, one may endeavor for perfection, and even among the siddhas, those who have already become perfect, only one who adopts the process of bhakti, devotional service, can understand Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As the different limbs of the body cannot see the eyes, the living entities cannot see the Supreme Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>Not by the senses, by the mind, by the life air, by thoughts within the heart, or by the vibration of words can the living entities ascertain the real situation of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although the different parts of the body do not have the power to see the eyes, the eyes direct the movements of the body’s different parts.</p>
<p>The legs move forward because the eyes see what is in front of them, and the hand touches because the eyes see touchable entities.</p>
<p>Similarly, every living being acts according to the direction of the Supersoul, who is situated within the heart.</p>
<p>As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: I am sitting in everyone’s heart and giving directions for remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita it is stated, isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati: (Bg.18.61) The Supreme Lord, as the Supersoul, is situated within the heart The living entity cannot do anything without the sanction of the Supersoul.</p>
<p>The Supersoul is acting at every moment, but the living entity cannot understand the form and activities of the Supersoul by manipulating his senses.</p>
<p>The example of the eyes and the bodily limbs is very appropriate.</p>
<p>If the limbs could see, they could walk forward without the help of the eyes, but that is impossible.</p>
<p>Although one cannot see the Supersoul in one’s heart through sensual activities, His direction is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Yamaraja was describing the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, but the order carriers of Yamaraja were very eager to know about the Visnudutas, who had defeated them in their encounter with Ajamila.</p>
<p>Yamaraja therefore stated that the Visnudutas resemble the Supreme Personality of Godhead in their bodily features, transcendental qualities and nature.</p>
<p>In other words, the Visnudutas, or Vaisnavas, are almost as qualified as the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Yamaraja informed the Yamadutas that the Visnudutas are no less powerful than Lord Visnu.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Yamaraja has specifically described the qualities of the Visnudutas to convince his own servants not to be envious of them.</p>
<p>Yamaraja warned the Yamadutas that the Visnudutas are worshiped with respectful obeisances by the demigods and are always very alert to protect the devotees of the Lord from the hands of enemies, from natural disturbances and from all dangerous conditions in this material world.</p>
<p>Sometimes the members of the Krsna Consciousness Society are afraid of the impending danger of world war and ask what would happen to them if a war should occur.</p>
<p>In all kinds of danger, they should be confident of their protection by the Visnudutas or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati).</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When challenged by the Visnudutas to describe the principles of religion, the Yamadutas said, veda-pranihito dharmah: the religious principles are the principles enacted in the Vedic literature.</p>
<p>They did not know, however, that the Vedic literature contains ritualistic ceremonies that are not transcendental, but are meant to keep peace and order among materialistic persons in the material world.</p>
<p>Real religious principles are nistraigunya, above the three modes of material nature, or transcendental.</p>
<p>The Yamadutas did not know these transcendental religious principles, and therefore when prevented from arresting Ajamila they were surprised.</p>
<p>Materialistic persons who attach all their faith to the Vedic rituals are described in Bhagavad-gita (2.42), wherein Krsna says, veda-vada-ratah partha nanyad astiti vadinah: the supposed followers of the Vedas say that there is nothing beyond the Vedic ceremonies.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a group of men in India who are very fond of the Vedic rituals, not understanding the meaning of these rituals, which are intended to elevate one gradually to the transcendental platform of knowing Krsna (vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah (Bg.15.15)).</p>
<p>Those who do not know this principle but who simply attach their faith to the Vedic rituals are called veda-vada-ratah.</p>
<p>Herein it is stated that the real religious principle is that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>That principle is stated in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) one should give up all other duties and surrender unto the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p>That is the real religious principle everyone should follow.</p>
<p>Even though one follows Vedic scriptures, one may not know this transcendental principle, for it is not known to everyone.</p>

<p>My dear servants, this transcendental religious principle, which is known as bhagavata-dharma, or surrender unto the Supreme Lord and love for Him, is uncontaminated by the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>It is very confidential and difficult for ordinary human beings to understand, but if by chance one fortunately understands it, he is immediately liberated, and thus he returns home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita Lord Krsna refers to bhagavata-dharma as the most confidential religious principle (sarva-guhyatamam, guhyad guhyataram).</p>
<p>Krsna says to Arjuna, Because you are My very dear friend, I am explaining to you the most confidential religion Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me One may ask, If this principle is very rarely understood, what is the use of it In answer, Yamaraja states herein that this religious principle is understandable if one follows the parampara system of Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the four Kumaras and the other standard authorities.</p>
<p>There are four lines of disciplic succession: one from Lord Brahma, one from Lord Siva, one from Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, and one from the Kumaras.</p>
<p>The disciplic succession from Lord Brahma is called the Brahma-sampradaya, the succession from Lord Siva (Sambhu) is called the Rudra-sampradaya, the one from the goddess of fortune, Laksmiji, is called the Sri-sampradaya, and the one from the Kumaras is called the Kumara-sampradaya.</p>
<p>One must take shelter of one of these four sampradayas in order to understand the most confidential religious system.</p>
<p>In the Padma Purana it is said, sampradaya-vihina ye mantras te nisphala matah: if one does not follow the four recognized disciplic successions, his mantra or initiation is useless.</p>
<p>In the present day there are many apasampradayas, or sampradayas which are not bona fide, which have no link to authorities like Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the Kumaras or Laksmi.</p>
<p>People are misguided by such sampradayas.</p>
<p>The sastras say that being initiated in such a sampradaya is a useless waste of time, for it will never enable one to understand the real religious principles.</p>

<p>etavan—this much; eva—indeed; loke asmin—in this material world; pumsam—of the living entities; dharmah—the religious principles; parah—transcendental; smrtah—recognized; bhakti-yogah—bhakti-yoga, or devotional service; bhagavati—to the Supreme Personality of Godhead (not to the demigods); tat—His; nama—of the holy name; grahana-adibhih—beginning with chanting.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Devotional service, beginning with the chanting of the holy name of the Lord, is the ultimate religious principle for the living entity in human society.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the previous verse, dharmam bhagavatam, real religious principles, are bhagavata-dharma, the principles described in Srimad-Bhagavatam itself or in Bhagavad-gita, the preliminary study of the Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>What are these principles? The Bhagavatam says, dharmah projjhita-kaitavo ’tra: (SB 1.1.2) in Srimad-Bhagavatam there are no cheating religious systems.</p>
<p>Everything in the Bhagavatam is directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Bhagavatam further says, sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje: (SB 1.2.6) the supreme religion is that which teaches its followers how to love the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the reach of experimental knowledge.</p>
<p>Such a religious system begins with tan-nama-grahana, chanting of the holy name of the Lord (sravanam kirtanam visnoh smaranam pada-sevanam (SB 7.5.23)).</p>
<p>After chanting the holy name of the Lord and dancing in ecstasy, one gradually sees the form of the Lord, the pastimes of the Lord and the transcendental qualities of the Lord.</p>
<p>This way one fully understands the situation of the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One can come to this understanding of the Lord, how He descends into the material world, how He takes His births and what activities He performs, but one can know this only by executing devotional service.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, bhaktya mam abhijanati: (Bg.18.55) simply by devotional service one can understand everything about the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>If one fortunately understands the Supreme Lord in this way, the result is tyaktva deham punar janma naiti: (Bg.4.9) after giving up his material body, he no longer has to take birth in this material world.</p>
<p>Instead, he returns home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate perfection.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (8.15):</p>
<p>mam upetya punar janma</p>
<p>duhkhalayam asasvatam</p>
<p>napnuvanti mahatmanah</p>
<p>samsiddhim paramam gatah</p>
<p>After attaining Me, the great souls, who are yogis in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>nama—of the holy name; uccarana—of the pronouncing; mahatmyam—the exalted position; hareh—of the Supreme Lord; pasyata—just see; putrakah—O my dear servants, who are like my sons; ajamilah api—even Ajamila (who was considered greatly sinful); yena—by the chanting of which; eva—certainly; mrtyu-pasat—from the ropes of death; amucyata—was delivered.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear servants, who are as good as my sons, just see how glorious is the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>The greatly sinful Ajamila chanted only to call his son, not knowing that he was chanting the Lord’s holy name.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by chanting the holy name of the Lord, he remembered Narayana, and thus he was immediately saved from the ropes of death.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There is no need to conduct research into the significance of the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>The history of Ajamila is sufficient proof of the power of the Lord’s holy name and the exalted position of a person who chants the holy name incessantly.</p>
<p>Therefore Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised:</p>
<p>harer nama harer nama</p>
<p>harer namaiva kevalam</p>
<p>kalau nasty eva nasty eva</p>
<p>nasty eva gatir anyatha</p>
<p>(Adi 17.21)</p>
<p>In this age of Kali, no one can perform all the ritualistic ceremonies for becoming liberated; that is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Therefore all the sastras and all the acaryas have recommended that in this age one chant the holy name.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>etavata—with this much; alam—sufficient; agha-nirharanaya—for taking away the reactions of sinful activities; pumsam—of human beings; sankirtanam—the congregational chanting; bhagavatah—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; guna—of the transcendental qualities; karma-namnam—and of His names according to His activities and pastimes; vikrusya—crying to without offense; putram—his son; aghavan—the sinful; yat—since; ajamilah api—even Ajamila; narayana—the Lord’s name, Narayana; iti—thus; mriyamanah—dying; iyaya—achieved; muktim—liberation.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Therefore it should be understood that one is easily relieved from all sinful reactions by chanting the holy name of the Lord and chanting of His qualities and activities.</p>
<p>This is the only process recommended for relief from sinful reactions.</p>
<p>Even if one chants the holy name of the Lord with improper pronunciation, he will achieve relief from material bondage if he chants without offenses.</p>
<p>Ajamila, for example, was extremely sinful, but while dying he merely chanted the holy name, and although calling his son, he achieved complete liberation because he remembered the name of Narayana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the assembly of Raghunatha dasa Gosvami’s father, Haridasa Thakura confirmed that simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord one is liberated, even if he does not chant completely inoffensively.</p>
<p>Smarta-brahmanas and Mayavadis do not believe that one can achieve liberation in this way, but the truth of Haridasa Thakura’s statement is supported by many quotations from Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>In his commentary on this verse, for example, Sridhara Svami gives the following quotation:</p>
<p>sayam pratar grnan bhaktya</p>
<p>duhkha-gramad vimucyate</p>
<p>If one always chants the holy name of the Lord with great devotion in the evening and in the morning, one can become free from all material miseries Another quotation confirms that one can achieve liberation if one hears the holy name of the Lord constantly, every day with great respect (anudinam idam adarena srnvan).</p>
<p>Another quotation says:</p>
<p>sravanam kirtanam dhyanam</p>
<p>harer adbhuta-karmanah</p>
<p>janma-karma-gunanam ca</p>
<p>tad-arthe ’khila-cestitam</p>
<p>One should always chant and hear about the extraordinarily wonderful activities of the Lord, one should meditate upon these activities, and one should endeavor to please the Lord (Bhag.11.3.27) Sridhara Svami also quotes from the Puranas, papa-ksayas ca bhavati smaratam tam ahar-nisam: One can become free from all sinful reactions simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord day and night (ahar-nisam) Furthermore, he quotes from Bhagavatam (6.3.31):</p>
<p>tasmat sankirtanam visnor</p>
<p>jagan-mangalam amhasam</p>
<p>mahatam api kauravya</p>
<p>viddhy aikantika-niskrtam</p>
<p>All these quotations prove that one who constantly engages in chanting and hearing of the holy activities, name, fame and form of the Lord is liberated.</p>
<p>As stated wonderfully in this verse, etavatalam agha-nirharanaya pumsam: simply by uttering the name of the Lord, one is freed from all sinful reactions.</p>
<p>The word alam, which is used in this verse, indicates that simply uttering the holy name of the Lord is sufficient.</p>
<p>This word is used with different imports.</p>
<p>As stated in the Amara-kosa, the most authorized dictionary in the Sanskrit language, alam bhusana-paryapti-sakti-varana-vacakam: the word alam is used to mean ornament sufficiency powe and restraint Here the word alam is used to indicate that there is no need of any other process, for the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is sufficient.</p>
<p>Even if one chants imperfectly, one becomes free from all sinful reactions by chanting.</p>
<p>This power of chanting the holy name was proved by the liberation of Ajamila.</p>
<p>When Ajamila chanted the holy name of Narayana, he did not precisely remember the Supreme Lord; instead, he remembered his own son.</p>
<p>At the time of death, Ajamila certainly was not very clean; indeed, he was famous as a great sinner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one’s physiological condition is completely disturbed at the time of death, and in such an awkward condition it would certainly have been very difficult for Ajamila to have chanted clearly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ajamila achieved liberation simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is to be said of those who are not sinful like Ajamila? It is to be concluded that with a strong vow one should chant the holy name of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare—for thus one will certainly be delivered from the clutches of maya by the grace of Krsna.</p>
<p>The chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra is recommended even for persons who commit offenses, because if they continue chanting they will gradually chant offenselessly.</p>
<p>By chanting the Hare Krsna mantra without offenses, one increases his love for Krsna.</p>
<p>As stated by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, prema pum-artho mahan: one’s main concern should be to increase one’s attachment to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and to increase one’s love for Him.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.19.24):</p>
<p>evam dharmair manusyanam</p>
<p>uddhavatmani vedinam</p>
<p>mayi sanjayate bhaktih</p>
<p>ko ’nyo ’rtho ’syavasisyate</p>
<p>My dear Uddhava, the supreme religious system for human society is that by which one can awaken his dormant love for Me Commenting on this verse, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the word bhakti by saying premaivoktah.</p>
<p>Kah anyah arthah asya: in the presence of bhakti, what is the necessity of liberation? Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura also quotes this verse from the Padma Purana:</p>
<p>namaparadha-yuktanam</p>
<p>namany eva haranty agham</p>
<p>avisranti-prayuktani</p>
<p>tany evartha-karani ca</p>
<p>Even if in the beginning one chants the Hare Krsna mantra with offenses, one will become free from such offenses by chanting again and again.</p>
<p>Papa-ksayas ca bhavati smaratam tam ahar-nisam: one becomes free from all sinful reactions if one chants day and night, following the recommendation of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>It was Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu who quoted the following verse:</p>
<p>harer nama harer nama</p>
<p>harer namaiva kevalam</p>
<p>kalau nasty eva nasty eva</p>
<p>nasty eva gatir anyatha</p>
<p>(Adi 17.21)</p>
<p>In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way If the members of the Krsna consciousness movement strictly follow this recommendation of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, their position will always be secure.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because they are bewildered by the illusory energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Yajnavalkya and Jaimini and other compilers of the religious scriptures cannot know the secret, confidential religious system of the twelve mahajanas.</p>
<p>They cannot understand the transcendental value of performing devotional service or chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>Because their minds are attracted to the ritualistic ceremonies mentioned in the Vedas—especially the Yajur Veda, Sama Veda and Rg Veda—their intelligence has become dull.</p>
<p>Thus they are busy collecting the ingredients for ritualistic ceremonies that yield only temporary benefits, such as elevation to Svargaloka for material happiness.</p>
<p>They are not attracted to the sankirtana movement; instead, they are interested in dharma, artha, kama and moksa.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since one may easily achieve the highest success by chanting the holy name of the Lord, one may ask why there are so many Vedic ritualistic ceremonies and why people are attracted to them.</p>
<p>This verse answers that question.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), vedais ca sarvair aham eva vedyah: the real purpose of studying the Vedas is to approach the lotus feet of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unintelligent people bewildered by the grandeur of Vedic yajnas want to see gorgeous sacrifices performed.</p>
<p>They want Vedic mantras chanted and huge amounts of money spent for such ceremonies.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have to observe the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies to please such unintelligent men.</p>
<p>Recently, when we established a large Krsna-Balarama temple in Vrndavana, we were obliged to have Vedic ceremonies enacted by brahmanas because the inhabitants of Vrndavana, especially the smarta-brahmanas, would not accept Europeans and Americans as bona fide brahmanas.</p>
<p>Thus we had to engage brahmanas to perform costly yajnas.</p>
<p>In spite of these yajnas, the members of our Society performed sankirtana loudly with mrdangas, and I considered the sankirtana more important than the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.</p>
<p>Both the ceremonies and the sankirtana were going on simultaneously.</p>
<p>The ceremonies were meant for persons interested in Vedic rituals for elevation to heavenly planets (jadi-krta-matir madhu-puspitayam), whereas the sankirtana was meant for pure devotees interested in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>We would simply have performed sankirtana, but then the inhabitants of Vrndavana would not have taken the installation ceremony seriously.</p>
<p>As explained here, the Vedic performances are meant for those whose intelligence has been dulled by the flowery language of the Vedas, which describe fruitive activities intended to elevate one to the higher planets.</p>
<p>Especially in this age of Kali, sankirtana alone is sufficient.</p>
<p>If the members of our temples in the different parts of the world simply continue sankirtana before the Deity, especially before Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, they will remain perfect.</p>
<p>There is no need of any other performances.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to keep oneself clean in habits and mind, Deity worship and other regulative principles are required.</p>
<p>Srila Jiva Gosvami says that although sankirtana is sufficient for the perfection of life, the arcana, or worship of the Deity in the temple, must continue in order that the devotees may stay clean and pure.</p>
<p>Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura therefore recommended that one follow both processes simultaneously.</p>
<p>We strictly follow his principle of performing Deity worship and sankirtana along parallel lines.</p>
<p>This we should continue.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Considering all these points, therefore, intelligent men decide to solve all problems by adopting the devotional service of chanting the holy name of the Lord, who is situated in everyone’s heart and who is a mine of all auspicious qualities.</p>
<p>Such persons are not within my jurisdiction for punishment.</p>
<p>Generally they never commit sinful activities, but even if by mistake or because of bewilderment or illusion they sometimes commit sinful acts, they are protected from sinful reactions because they always chant the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes the following verse from the prayers of Lord Brahma (Bhag.10.14.29):</p>
<p>athapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-</p>
<p>prasada-lesanugrhita eva hi</p>
<p>janati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno</p>
<p>na canya eko ’pi ciram vicinvan</p>
<p>The purport is that even though one is a very learned scholar of the Vedic sastras, he may be completely unaware of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His name, fame, qualities and so forth, whereas one who is not a great scholar can understand the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead if he somehow or other becomes a pure devotee of the Lord by engaging in devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse spoken by Yamaraja says, evam vimrsya sudhiyo bhagavati: those who engage in the loving service of the Lord become sudhiyah, intelligent, but this is not so of a Vedic scholar who does not understand Krsna’s name, fame and qualities.</p>
<p>A pure devotee is one whose intelligence is clear; he is truly thoughtful because he engages in the service of the Lord—not as a matter of show, but with love, with his mind, words and body.</p>
<p>Nondevotees may make a show of religion, but it is not very effective because although they ostentatiously attend a temple or church, they are thinking of something else.</p>
<p>Such persons are neglecting their religious duty and are punishable by Yamaraja.</p>
<p>But a devotee who commits sinful acts, which he may do unwillingly or accidentally because of his former habits, is excused.</p>
<p>That is the value of the sankirtana movement.</p>

<p>In effect, Yamaraja warned his servants, My dear servants, despite what you may have done previously to disturb the devotees, henceforward you should stop.</p>
<p>The actions of devotees who have surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Lord and who constantly chant the holy name of the Lord are praised by the demigods and the residents of Siddhaloka.</p>
<p>Those devotees are so respectable and exalted that Lord Visnu personally protects them with the club in His hand.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After warning the Yamadutas not to approach the devotees, Yamaraja now indicates who is to be brought before him.</p>
<p>He specifically advises the Yamadutas to bring him the materialistic persons who are attached to household life merely for sex.</p>
<p>As stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam, yan maithunadi-grhamedhi-sukham hi tuccham: (SB 7.9.45) people are attached to household life for sex only.</p>
<p>They are always harassed in many ways by their material engagements, and their only happiness is that after working very hard all day, at night they sleep and indulge in sex.</p>
<p>Nidraya hriyate naktam vyavayena ca va vayah: (SB 2.1.3) at night, materialistic householders sleep or indulge in sex life.</p>
<p>Diva carthehaya rajan kutumba-bharanena va: during the day they are busy trying to find out where money is, and if they get money they spend it to maintain their families.</p>
<p>Yamaraja specifically advises his servants to bring these persons to him for punishment and not to bring the devotees, who always lick the honey at the lotus feet of the Lord, who are equal to everyone, and who try to preach Krsna consciousness because of sympathy for all living entities.</p>
<p>Devotees are not liable to punishment by Yamaraja, but persons who have no information of Krsna consciousness cannot be protected by their material life of so-called family enjoyment.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam says (2.1.4):</p>

<p>My dear servants, please bring to me only those sinful persons who do not use their tongues to chant the holy name and qualities of Krsna, whose hearts do not remember the lotus feet of Krsna even once, and whose heads do not bow down even once before Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>Send me those who do not perform their duties toward Visnu, which are the only duties in human life.</p>
<p>Please bring me all such fools and rascals.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word visnu-krtyan is very important in this verse because the purpose of human life is to please Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Varnasrama-dharma is also meant for that purpose.</p>
<p>Visnu Purana (3.8.9):</p>
<p>varnasramacaravata</p>
<p>purusena parah puman</p>
<p>visnur aradhyate pantha</p>
<p>nanyat tat-tosa-karanam</p>
<p>Human society is meant to follow strictly the varnasrama-dharma, which divides society into four social divisions (brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra) and four spiritual divisions (brahmacarya, grhastha, vanaprastha and sannyasa).</p>
<p>Varnasrama-dharma easily brings one nearer to Lord Visnu, who is the only true objective in human society.</p>
<p>Na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: (SB 7.5.31) unfortunately, however, people do not know that their self-interest is to return home, back to Godhead, or to approach Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Durasaya ye bahir-artha-maninah: instead, they are simply bewildered.</p>
<p>Every human being is expected to perform duties meant for approaching Lord Visnu.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One may very easily practice chanting and hearing the holy name of the Lord and thus become ecstatic in spiritual life.</p>

<p>Sukadeva Gosvami especially requested King Pariksit to note this fact very carefully.</p>
<p>There is no profit, however, in executing the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies.</p>
<p>By performing such activities one may go to the higher planetary systems, but as stated in Bhagavad-gita (9.21), ksine punye martya-lokam visanti: when the period of one’s enjoyment in the heavenly planets is terminated because of the limited extent of the results of one’s pious activities, one must return to earth.</p>
<p>Thus there is no use in endeavoring to travel up and down in the universe.</p>
<p>It is better to chant the holy name of the Lord so that one may become fully purified and eligible to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>That is the aim of life, and that is the perfection of life.</p>

<p>Others, however, who are addicted to Vedic rituals because they have neglected the service of the Lord’s lotus feet and are enchanted by lusty desires, sometimes perform acts of atonement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, being incompletely purified, they return to sinful activities again and again.</p>

<p>A devotee’s duty is to chant the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>One may sometimes chant with offenses and sometimes without offenses, but if one seriously adopts this process, he will achieve perfection, which cannot be achieved through Vedic ritualistic ceremonies of atonement.</p>
<p>Persons who are attached to the Vedic ritualistic ceremonies, but do not believe in devotional service, who advise atonement, but do not appreciate the chanting of the Lord’s holy name, fail to achieve the highest perfection.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-3" id="summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#64" id="64">6.4</a></h3>
<p>After Maharaja Pariksit appealed to Sukadeva Gosvami to describe in further detail the creation of the living entities within this universe, Sukadeva Gosvami informed him that when the Pracetas, the ten sons of Pracinabarhi, entered the sea to execute austerities, the planet earth was neglected because of the absence of a king.</p>
<p>Naturally many weeds and unnecessary trees grew, and no food grains were produced.</p>
<p>Indeed, all the land became like a forest.</p>
<p>When the ten Pracetas came out of the sea and saw the entire world full of trees, they were very angry with the trees and decided to destroy them all to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>Thus the Pracetas created wind and fire to burn the trees to ashes.</p>
<p>Soma, however, the king of the moon and the king of all vegetation, forbade the Pracetas to destroy the trees, since the trees are the source of fruit and flowers for all living beings.</p>
<p>Just to satisfy the Pracetas, Soma gave them a beautiful girl born of Pramloca Apsara.</p>
<p>By the semen of all the Pracetas, Daksa was born of that girl.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Daksa created all the demigods, demons and human beings, but when he found the population not increasing properly, he took sannyasa and went to Vindhya Mountain, where be underwent severe austerities and offered Lord Visnu a particular prayer known as Hamsa-guhya, by which Lord Visnu became very pleased with him.</p>
<p>The contents of the prayer were as follows The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Supersoul, Lord Hari, is the controller of both the living entities and the material nature.</p>
<p>He is self-sufficient and self-effulgent.</p>
<p>As the subject matter of perception is not the cause of our perceiving senses, so the living entity, although within his body, does not cause his eternal friend the Supersoul, who is the cause of creation of all the senses.</p>
<p>Because of the living entity’s ignorance, his senses are engaged with material objects.</p>
<p>Since the living entity is alive, he can understand the creation of this material world to some extent, but he cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond the conception of the body, mind and intelligence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, great sages who are always in meditation can see the personal form of the Lord within their hearts Since an ordinary living being is materially contaminated, his words and intelligence are also material.</p>
<p>Therefore he cannot ascertain the Supreme Personality of Godhead by manipulating his material senses.</p>
<p>The conception of God derived through the material senses is inaccurate because the Supreme Lord is beyond the material senses, but when one engages his senses in devotional service, the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead is revealed on the platform of the soul.</p>
<p>When that Supreme Godhead becomes the aim of one’s life, one is said to have attained spiritual knowledge The Supreme Brahman is the cause of all causes because He originally existed before the creation.</p>
<p>He is the original cause of everything, both material and spiritual, and His existence is independent.</p>
<p>However, the Lord has a potency called avidya, the illusory energy, which induces the false arguer to think himself perfect and which induces the illusory energy to bewilder the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>That Supreme Brahman, the Supersoul, is very affectionate to His devotees.</p>
<p>To bestow mercy upon them, He discloses His form, name, attributes and qualities to be worshiped within this material world Unfortunately, however, those who are materially absorbed worship various demigods.</p>
<p>As the air passes over a lotus flower and carries the scent of the flower with it, or as the air sometimes carries dust and therefore assumes colors, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears as the various demigods according to the desires of His various foolish worshipers, but actually He is the supreme truth, Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>To fulfill the desires of His devotees, He appears in various incarnations, and therefore there is no need to worship the demigods Being very satisfied by the prayers of Daksa, Lord Visnu appeared before Daksa with eight arms.</p>
<p>The Lord was dressed in yellow garments and had a blackish complexion.</p>
<p>Understanding that Daksa was very eager to follow the path of enjoyment, the Lord awarded him the potency to enjoy the illusory energy.</p>
<p>The Lord offered him the daughter of Pancajana named Asikni, who was suitable for Maharaja Daksa to enjoy in sex.</p>
<p>Indeed, Daksa received his name because he was very expert in sex life.</p>
<p>After awarding this benediction, Lord Visnu disappeared.</p>

<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: When the ten sons of Pracinabarhi emerged from the waters, in which they were performing austerities, they saw that the entire surface of the world was covered by trees.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When King Pracinabarhi was performing Vedic rituals in which the killing of animals was recommended, Narada Muni, out of compassion, advised him to stop.</p>
<p>Pracinabarhi understood Narada properly and then left the kingdom to perform austerities in the forest.</p>
<p>His ten sons, however, were performing austerities within the water, and therefore there was no king to see to the management of the world.</p>
<p>When the ten sons, the Pracetas, came out of the water, they saw that the earth was overrun with trees.</p>
<p>When the government neglects agriculture, which is necessary for the production of food, the land becomes covered with unnecessary trees.</p>
<p>Of course, many trees are useful because they produce fruits and flowers, but many other trees are unnecessary.</p>
<p>They could be used as fuel and the land cleared and used for agriculture.</p>
<p>When the government is negligent, less grain is produced.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (18.44), krsi-go-raksya-vanijyam vaisya-karma svabhava jam: the proper engagements for vaisyas, according to their nature, are to farm and to protect cows.</p>
<p>The duty of the government and the ksatriyas is to see that the members of the third class, the vaisyas, who are neither brahmanas nor ksatriyas, are thus properly engaged.</p>
<p>Ksatriyas are meant to protect human beings, whereas vaisyas are meant to protect useful animals, especially cows.</p>

<p>These four-legged animals are those such as deer and goats, not cows, which are meant to be protected.</p>
<p>Generally the men of the higher classes of society—the brahmanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas—do not eat meat.</p>
<p>Sometimes ksatriyas go to the forest to kill animals like deer because they have to learn the art of killing, and sometimes they eat the animals also.</p>
<p>Sudras, too, eat animals such as goats.</p>
<p>Cows, however, are never meant to be killed or eaten by human beings.</p>
<p>In every sastra, cow killing is vehemently condemned.</p>
<p>Indeed, one who kills a cow must suffer for as many years as there are hairs on the body of a cow.</p>
<p>Manu-samhita says, pravrttir esa bhutanam nivrttis tu maha-phala: we have many tendencies in this material world, but in human life one is meant to learn how to curb those tendencies.</p>
<p>Those who desire to eat meat may satisfy the demands of their tongues by eating lower animals, but they should never kill cows, who are actually accepted as the mothers of human society because they supply milk.</p>
<p>The sastra especially recommends, krsi-go-raksya: the vaisya section of humanity should arrange for the food of the entire society through agricultural activities and should give full protection to the cows, which are the most useful animals because they supply milk to human society.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The path of goodness traversed by your father, grandfather and great-grandfathers is that of maintaining the subjects (prajas), including the men, animals and trees.</p>
<p>That is the path you should follow.</p>
<p>Unnecessary anger is contrary to your duty.</p>
<p>Therefore I request you to control your anger.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the words pitra pitamahenapi justam vah prapitamahaih depict an honest royal family, consisting of the kings, their father, their grandfather and their great-grandfathers.</p>
<p>Such a royal family has a prestigious position because it maintains the citizens, or prajas.</p>
<p>The word praja refers to one who has taken birth within the jurisdiction of the government.</p>
<p>The exalted royal families were conscious that all living beings, whether human, animal or lower than animal, should be given protection.</p>
<p>The modern democratic system cannot be exalted in this way because the leaders elected strive only for power and have no sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>In a monarchy, a king with a prestigious position follows the great deeds of his forefathers.</p>
<p>Thus Soma, the king of the moon, here reminds the Pracetas about the glories of their father, grandfather and great-grandfathers.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As the father and mother are the friends and maintainers of their children, as the eyelid is the protector of the eye, as the husband is the maintainer and protector of a woman, as the householder is the maintainer and protector of beggars, and as the learned is the friend of the ignorant, so the king is the protector and giver of life to all his subjects.</p>
<p>The trees are also subjects of the king.</p>
<p>Therefore they should be given protection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>By the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead, there are various protectors and maintainers for helpless living entities.</p>
<p>The trees are also considered prajas, subjects of the king, and therefore the duty of the monarch is to protect even the trees, not to speak of others.</p>
<p>The king is duty-bound to protect the living entities in his kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus although the parents are directly responsible for the protection and maintenance of their children, the duty of the king is to see that all parents do their duty properly.</p>
<p>Similarly, the king is also responsible for overseeing the other protectors mentioned in this verse.</p>
<p>It may also be noted that the beggars who should be maintained by the householders are not professional beggars, but sannyasis and brahmanas, to whom the householders should supply food and clothing.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated as the Supersoul within the cores of the hearts of all living entities, whether moving or nonmoving, including men, birds, animals, trees and, indeed, all living entities.</p>
<p>Therefore you should consider every body a residence or temple of the Lord.</p>
<p>By such vision you will satisfy the Lord.</p>

<p>Therefore, since everyone’s body is the residence of the Supreme Lord, one should not destroy the body because of unnecessary envy.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When one becomes angry, he forgets himself and his situation, but if one is able to consider his situation by knowledge, one transcends the influence of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>One is always a servant of lusty desires, anger, greed, illusion, envy and so forth, but if one obtains sufficient strength in spiritual advancement, one can control them.</p>
<p>One who obtains such control will always be transcendentally situated, untouched by the modes of material nature.</p>

<p>One must perform devotional service because otherwise one will become victimized by the modes of material nature.</p>

<p>In the womb of that girl the Pracetas all begot a son named Daksa, who filled the three worlds with living entities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Daksa was first born during the reign of Svayambhuva Manu, but because of offending Lord Siva he was punished by having the head of a goat substituted for his own head.</p>
<p>Thus insulted, he had to give up that body, and in the sixth manvantara, called the Caksusa manvantara, he was born of the womb of Marisa as Daksa.</p>
<p>In this connection Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes this verse:</p>
<p>caksuse tv antare prapte</p>
<p>prak-sarge kala-vidrute</p>
<p>yah sasarja praja istah</p>
<p>sa dakso daiva-coditah</p>
<p>His previous body had been destroyed, but he, the same Daksa, inspired by the supreme will, created all the desired living entities in the Caksusa manvantara (Bhag.4.30.49) Thus Daksa regained his previous opulence and again begot thousands and millions of children to fill the three worlds.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa said: The Supreme Personality of Godhead is transcendental to the illusory energy and the physical categories it produces.</p>
<p>He possesses the potency for unfailing knowledge and supreme willpower, and He is the controller of the living entities and the illusory energy.</p>
<p>The conditioned souls who have accepted this material manifestation as everything cannot see Him, for He is above the evidence of experimental knowledge.</p>
<p>Self-evident and self-sufficient, He is not caused by any superior cause.</p>
<p>Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The transcendental position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is explained herewith.</p>
<p>He is not perceivable by the conditioned souls, who are accustomed to material vision and cannot understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead exists in His abode, which is beyond that vision.</p>
<p>Even if a materialistic person could count all the atoms in the universe, he would still be unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.34):</p>
<p>panthas tu koti-sata-vatsara-sampragamyo</p>

<p>so ’py asti yat-prapada-simny avicintya-tattve</p>

<p>The conditioned souls may try to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead for many billions of years through their mental speculative processes, traveling at the speed of the mind or the wind, but still the Absolute Truth will remain inconceivable to them because a materialistic person cannot measure the length and breadth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s unlimited existence.</p>
<p>If the Absolute Truth is beyond measurement, one may ask, how can one realize Him? The answer is given here by the word svayambhuve: one may understand Him or not, but nevertheless He is existing in His own spiritual potency.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As the sense objects (form, taste, touch, smell and sound) cannot understand how the senses perceive them, so the conditioned soul, although residing in his body along with the Supersoul, cannot understand how the supreme spiritual person, the master of the material creation, directs his senses.</p>
<p>Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto that Supreme Person, who is the supreme controller.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The individual soul and the Supreme Soul live together within the body.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Upanisads by the analogy that two friendly birds live in one tree—one bird eating the fruit of the tree and the other simply witnessing and directing.</p>
<p>Although the individual living being, who is compared to the bird that is eating, is sitting with his friend the Supreme Soul, the individual living being cannot see Him.</p>
<p>Actually the Supersoul is directing the workings of his senses in the enjoyment of sense objects, but as these sense objects cannot see the senses, the conditioned soul cannot see the directing soul.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul has desires, and the Supreme Soul fulfills them, but the conditioned soul is unable to see the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>Thus Prajapati Daksa offers his obeisances to the Supreme Soul, the Supersoul, even though unable to see Him.</p>
<p>Another example given is that although ordinary citizens work under the direction of the government, they cannot understand how they are being governed or what the government is.</p>
<p>In this regard, Madhvacarya quotes the following verse from the Skanda Purana:</p>
<p>yatha rajnah priyatvam tu</p>
<p>bhrtya vedena catmanah</p>
<p>tatha jivo na yat-sakhyam</p>
<p>vetti tasmai namo ’stu te</p>
<p>As the various servants in the different departments of big establishments cannot see the supreme managing director under whom they are working, the conditioned souls cannot see the supreme friend sitting within their bodies.</p>
<p>Let us therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto the Supreme, who is invisible to our material eyes</p>

<p>Because they are only matter, the body, the life airs, the external and internal senses, the five gross elements and the subtle sense objects (form, taste, smell, sound and touch) cannot know their own nature, the nature of the other senses or the nature of their controllers.</p>
<p>But the living being, because of his spiritual nature, can know his body, the life airs, the senses, the elements and the sense objects, and he can also know the three qualities that form their roots.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although the living being is completely aware of them, he is unable to see the Supreme Being, who is omniscient and unlimited.</p>
<p>I therefore offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Material scientists can make an analytical study of the physical elements, the body, the senses, the sense objects and even the air that controls the vital force, but still they cannot understand that above all these is the real spirit soul.</p>
<p>In other words, the living entity, because of his being a spirit soul, can understand all the material objects, or, when self-realized, he can understand the Paramatma, upon whom yogis meditate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the living being, even if advanced, cannot understand the Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, for He is ananta, unlimited, in all six opulences.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two stages of God realization.</p>
<p>One is called sujneyam, or very easily understood (generally by mental speculation), and the other is called durjneyam, understood only with difficulty.</p>
<p>Paramatma realization and Brahman realization are considered sujneyam, but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is durjneyam.</p>
<p>As described here, one attains the ultimate realization of the Personality of Godhead when one gives up the activities of the mind—thinking, feeling and willing—or, in other words, when mental speculation stops.</p>
<p>This transcendental realization is above susupti, deep sleep.</p>
<p>In our gross conditional stage we perceive things through material experience and remembrance, and in the subtle stage we perceive the world in dreams.</p>
<p>The process of vision also involves remembrance and also exists in a subtle form.</p>
<p>Above gross experience and dreams is susupti, deep sleep, and when one comes to the completely spiritual platform, transcending deep sleep, he attains trance, visuddha-sattva, or vasudeva-sattva, in which the Personality of Godhead is revealed.</p>
<p>Atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih: (BRS.1.2.234) as long as one is situated in duality, on the sensual platform, gross or subtle, realization of the original Personality of Godhead is impossible.</p>
<p>Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: but when one engages his senses in the service of the Lord—specifically, when one engages the tongue in chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and tasting only Krsna prasada with a spirit of service—the Supreme Personality of Godhead is revealed.</p>
<p>This is indicated in this verse by the word suci-sadmane.</p>
<p>Suci means purified.</p>
<p>By the spirit of rendering service with one’s senses, one’s entire existence becomes suci-sadma, the platform of uncontaminated purity.</p>
<p>Daksa therefore offers his respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is revealed on the platform of suci-sadma.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.6): tathapi bhuman mahimagunasya te viboddhum arhaty amalantar-atmabhih One whose heart has become completely purified, my Lord, can understand the transcendental qualities of Your Lordship and can understand the greatness of Your activities</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just as great learned brahmanas who are expert in performing ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices can extract the fire dormant within wooden fuel by chanting the fifteen Samidheni mantras, thus proving the efficacy of the Vedic mantras, so those who are actually advanced in consciousness—in other words, those who are Krsna conscious—can find the Supersoul, who by His own spiritual potency is situated within the heart.</p>
<p>The heart is covered by the three modes of material nature and the nine material elements (material nature, the total material energy, the ego, the mind and the five objects of sense gratification), and also by the five material elements and the ten senses.</p>
<p>These twenty-seven elements constitute the external energy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Great yogis meditate upon the Lord, who is situated as the Supersoul, Paramatma, within the core of the heart.</p>
<p>May that Supersoul be pleased with me.</p>
<p>The Supersoul is realized when one is eager for liberation from the unlimited varieties of material life.</p>
<p>One actually attains such liberation when he engages in the transcendental loving service of the Lord and realizes the Lord because of his attitude of service.</p>
<p>The Lord may be addressed by various spiritual names, which are inconceivable to the material senses.</p>
<p>When will that Supreme Personality of Godhead be pleased with me?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In his commentary to this verse, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura uses the word durvijneyam, which means very difficult to realize The pure stage of existence is described in Bhagavad-gita (7.28), wherein Krsna says:</p>
<p>yesam tv anta-gatam papam</p>
<p>jananam punya-karmanam</p>
<p>te dvandva-moha-nirmukta</p>
<p>bhajante mam drdha-vratah</p>
<p>Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (9.14) the Lord says:</p>
<p>satatam kirtayanto mam</p>
<p>yatantas ca drdha-vratah</p>
<p>namasyantas ca mam bhaktya</p>
<p>nitya-yukta upasate</p>
<p>Always chanting My glories, endeavoring with great determination, bowing down before Me, these great souls perpetually worship Me with devotion One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead after transcending all material impediments.</p>
<p>Gita (7.3):</p>
<p>manusyanam sahasresu</p>
<p>kascid yatati siddhaye</p>
<p>yatatam api siddhanam</p>
<p>kascin mam vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth To understand Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one must undergo severe penances and austerities, but since the path of devotional service is perfect, by following this process one can very easily come to the spiritual platform and understand the Lord.</p>
<p>This, too, is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), wherein Krsna says:</p>
<p>bhaktya mam abhijanati</p>
<p>yavan yas casmi tattvatah</p>
<p>tato mam tattvato jnatva</p>
<p>visate tad-anantaram</p>
<p>One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service.</p>
<p>And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God Thus although the subject matter is durvijneyam, extremely difficult to understand, it becomes easy if one follows the prescribed method.</p>
<p>Coming in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is possible through pure devotional service, which begins with sravanam kirtanam visnoh (SB 7.5.23).</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.8.5): pravistah karna-randhrena svanam bhava-saroruham.</p>
<p>The process of hearing and chanting enters the core of the heart, and in this way one becomes a pure devotee.</p>
<p>By continuing this process, one comes to the stage of transcendental love, and then he appreciates the transcendental name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In other words, a pure devotee, by devotional service, is able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead despite many material impediments, which are all various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Easily making his way through these impediments, a devotee comes directly in contact with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>After all, the material impediments described in these verses are but various energies of the Lord.</p>
<p>When a devotee is eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he prays to the Lord:</p>
<p>ayi nanda-tanuja kinkaram</p>
<p>patitam mam visame bhavambudhau</p>
<p>krpaya tava pada-pankaja-</p>
<p>sthita-dhuli-sadrsam vicintaya</p>
<p>O son of Maharaja Nanda (Krsna), I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death.</p>
<p>Please pick me up from this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet Being pleased with the devotee, the Lord turns all his material impediments into spiritual service.</p>
<p>In this connection Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura quotes a verse from the Visnu Purana:</p>
<p>hladini sandhini samvit</p>
<p>tvayy eka sarva-samsthitau</p>
<p>hlada-tapa-kari misra</p>
<p>tvayi no guna-varjite</p>
<p>In the material world, the spiritual energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is manifested as tapa-kari, which means causing miseries Everyone hankers for happiness, but although happiness originally comes from the pleasure potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, in the material world, because of material activities, the pleasure potency of the Lord becomes a source of miseries (hlada-tapa-kari).</p>
<p>False happiness in the material world is the source of distress, but when one’s endeavors for happiness are redirected toward the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this tapa-kari element of misery is vanquished.</p>
<p>An example given in this connection is that extracting fire from wood is certainly difficult, but when the fire comes out it burns the wood to ashes.</p>
<p>In other words, experiencing the Supreme Personality of Godhead is extremely difficult for those devoid of devotional service, but everything becomes easier for a devotee, and thus he can very easily meet the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Here the prayers say that the form of the Lord is beyond the jurisdiction of material form and is therefore inconceivable.</p>
<p>A devotee prays, however, My dear Lord, be pleased with me so that I may very easily see Your transcendental form and potency Nondevotees try to understand the Supreme Brahman by discussions of neti neti.</p>
<p>Nisedha-nirvana-sukhanubhutih: a devotee, however, simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, avoids such laborious speculations and realizes the existence of the Lord very easily.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Anything expressed by material vibrations, anything ascertained by material intelligence and anything experienced by the material senses or concocted within the material mind is but an effect of the modes of material nature and therefore has nothing to do with the real nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is beyond the creation of this material world, for He is the source of the material qualities and creation.</p>
<p>As the cause of all causes, He exists before the creation and after the creation.</p>
<p>I wish to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One who manufactures names, forms, qualities or paraphernalia pertaining to the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot understand Him, since He is beyond creation.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is the creator of everything, and this means that He existed when there was no creation.</p>
<p>In other words, His name, form and qualities are not materially created entities; they are transcendental always.</p>
<p>Therefore by our material concoctions, vibrations and thoughts we cannot ascertain the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>This is explained in the verse atah sri-krsna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih (BRS.1.2.234).</p>
<p>Pracetasa, Daksa, herein offers prayers unto the Transcendence, not to anyone within the material creation.</p>
<p>Only fools and rascals think God a material creation.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.11):</p>
<p>avajananti mam mudha</p>
<p>manusim tanum asritam</p>
<p>param bhavam ajananto</p>
<p>mama bhuta-mahesvaram</p>
<p>Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.</p>
<p>They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be Therefore, one must receive knowledge from a person to whom the Lord has revealed Himself; there is no value in creating an imaginary name or form for the Lord.</p>
<p>Sripada Sankaracarya was an impersonalist, but nevertheless he said, narayanah paro ’vyaktat: Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not a person of the material world.</p>
<p>We cannot assign Narayana a material designation, as the foolish attempt to do when they speak of daridra-narayana (poor Narayana).</p>
<p>Narayana is always transcendental, beyond this material creation.</p>
<p>How can He become daridra-narayana? Poverty is found within this material world, but in the spiritual world, there is no such thing as poverty.</p>
<p>Therefore the idea of daridra-narayana is merely a concoction.</p>
<p>Daksa very carefully points out that material designations cannot be names of the worshipable Lord: yad yan niruktam vacasa nirupitam.</p>
<p>Nirukta refers to the Vedic dictionary.</p>
<p>One cannot properly understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead merely by picking up expressions from a dictionary.</p>
<p>In praying to the Lord, Daksa does not wish material names and forms to be the objects of his worship; rather, he wants to worship the Lord, who existed before the creation of material dictionaries and names.</p>
<p>As confirmed in the Vedas, yato vaco nivartante/ aprapya manasa saha: the name, form, attributes and paraphernalia of the Lord cannot be ascertained through a material dictionary.</p>
<p>However, if one reaches the transcendental platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes well acquainted with everything, material and spiritual.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in another Vedic mantra: tam eva viditvati mrtyum eti.</p>
<p>If one can somehow or other, by the grace of the Lord, understand the transcendental position of the Lord, one becomes eternal.</p>
<p>This is further confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna Simply by understanding the Supreme Lord, one goes beyond birth, death, old age and disease.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Brahman, Krsna, is the ultimate resting place and source of everything.</p>
<p>Everything is done by Him, everything belongs to Him, and everything is offered to Him.</p>
<p>He is the ultimate objective, and whether acting or causing others to act, He is the ultimate doer.</p>
<p>There are many causes, high and low, but since He is the cause of all causes, He is well known as the Supreme Brahman who existed before all activities.</p>
<p>He is one without a second and has no other cause.</p>
<p>I therefore offer my respects unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the original cause, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (aham sarvasya prabhavah).</p>
<p>Even this material world, which is conducted under the modes of material nature, is caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who therefore also has an intimate relationship with the material world.</p>
<p>If the material world were not a part of His body, the Supreme Lord, the supreme cause, would be incomplete.</p>
<p>Therefore we hear, vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah: (Bg.7.19) if one knows that Vasudeva is the original cause of all causes, he becomes a perfect mahatma.</p>

<p>Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller.</p>
<p>He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.</p>
<p>He is the origin of all.</p>
<p>He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes The Supreme Brahman (tad brahma) is the cause of all causes, but He has no cause.</p>
<p>Anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam: (Bs.5.1) Govinda, Krsna, is the original cause of all causes, but He has no cause for His appearance as Govinda.</p>
<p>Govinda expands in multifarious forms, but nevertheless they are one.</p>
<p>As confirmed by Madhvacarya, ananyah sadrsabhavad eko rupady-abhedatah: Krsna has no cause nor any equal, and He is one because His various forms, as svamsa and vibhinnamsa, are nondifferent from Himself.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the all-pervading Supreme Personality of Godhead, who possesses unlimited transcendental qualities.</p>
<p>Acting from within the cores of the hearts of all philosophers, who propagate various views, He causes them to forget their own souls while sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing among themselves.</p>
<p>Thus He creates within this material world a situation in which they are unable to come to a conclusion.</p>
<p>I offer my obeisances unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since time immemorial or since the creation of the cosmic manifestation, the conditioned souls have formed various parties of philosophical speculation, but this is not true of the devotees.</p>
<p>Nondevotees have different ideas of creation, maintenance and annihilation, and therefore they are called vadis and prativadis—proponents and counterproponents.</p>
<p>It is understood from the statement of Mahabharata that there are many munis, or speculators:</p>
<p>tarko ’pratisthah srutayo vibhinna</p>
<p>nasav rsir yasya matam na bhinnam</p>
<p>All speculators must disagree with other speculators; otherwise, why should there be so many opposing parties concerned with ascertaining the supreme cause? Philosophy means finding the ultimate cause.</p>
<p>As Vedanta-sutra very reasonably says, athato brahma jijnasa: human life is meant for understanding the ultimate cause.</p>
<p>Devotees accept that the ultimate cause is Krsna because this conclusion is supported by all Vedic literature and also by Krsna Himself, who says, aham sarvasya prabhavah: I am the source of everything Devotees have no problem understanding the ultimate cause of everything, but nondevotees must face many opposing elements because everyone who wants to be a prominent philosopher invents his own way.</p>
<p>In India there are many parties of philosophers, such as the dvaita-vadis, advaita-vadis, vaisesikas, mimamsakas, Mayavadis and svabhava-vadis, and each of them opposes the others.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Western countries there are also many philosophers with different views of creation, life, maintenance and annihilation.</p>
<p>Thus it is undoubtedly a fact that there are countless philosophers throughout the world, each of them contradicting the others.</p>
<p>Now, one might ask why there are so many philosophers if the ultimate goal of philosophy is one.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the ultimate cause is one—the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>As Arjuna told Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (10.12):</p>
<p>param brahma param dhama</p>
<p>pavitram paramam bhavan</p>
<p>purusam sasvatam divyam</p>
<p>adi-devam ajam vibhum</p>
<p>You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person.</p>
<p>You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all-pervading beauty Nondevotee speculators, however, do not accept an ultimate cause (sarva-karana-karanam (Bs.5.1)).</p>
<p>Because they are ignorant and bewildered concerning the soul and its activities, even though some of them have a vague idea of the soul, many controversies arise, and the philosophical speculators can never reach a conclusion.</p>
<p>All of these speculators are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (16.19–20):</p>
<p>tan aham dvisatah kruran</p>
<p>samsaresu naradhaman</p>
<p>ksipamy ajasram asubhan</p>
<p>asurisv eva yonisu</p>
<p>asurim yonim apanna</p>
<p>mudha janmani janmani</p>
<p>mam aprapyaiva kaunteya</p>
<p>tato yanty adhamam gatim</p>
<p>Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.</p>
<p>Attaining repeated birth among the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me.</p>
<p>Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence Because of their envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nondevotees are born in demoniac families life after life.</p>
<p>They are great offenders, and because of their offenses the Supreme Lord keeps them always bewildered.</p>
<p>Kurvanti caisam muhur atma-moham: the Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, purposely keeps them in darkness (atma-moham).</p>
<p>The great authority Parasara, the father of Vyasadeva, explains the Supreme Personality of Godhead thus:</p>
<p>jnana-sakti-balaisvarya-</p>
<p>virya-tejamsy asesatah</p>
<p>bhagavac-chabda-vacyani</p>
<p>vina heyair gunadibhih</p>
<p>The demoniac speculators cannot understand the transcendental qualities, form, pastimes, strength, knowledge and opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which are all free from material contamination (vina heyair gunadibhih).</p>
<p>These speculators are envious of the existence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Jagad ahur anisvaram: their conclusion is that the entire cosmic manifestation has no controller, but is just working naturally.</p>
<p>Thus they are kept in constant darkness, birth after birth, and cannot understand the real cause of all causes.</p>
<p>This is the reason why there are so many schools of philosophical speculation.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>There are two parties—namely, the theists and the atheists.</p>
<p>The theist, who accepts the Supersoul, finds the spiritual cause through mystic yoga.</p>
<p>The Sankhyite, however, who merely analyzes the material elements, comes to a conclusion of impersonalism and does not accept a supreme cause—whether Bhagavan, Paramatma or even Brahman.</p>
<p>Instead, he is preoccupied with the superfluous, external activities of material nature.</p>
<p>Ultimately, however, both parties demonstrate the Absolute Truth because although they offer opposing statements, their object is the same ultimate cause.</p>
<p>They are both approaching the same Supreme Brahman, to whom I offer my respectful obeisances.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Actually there are two sides to this argument.</p>
<p>Some say that the Absolute has no form (nirakara), and others say that the Absolute has a form (sakara).</p>
<p>Therefore the word form is the common factor, although some accept it (asti or astika) whereas others try to negate it (nasti or nastika).</p>
<p>Since the devotee considers the word for (akara) the common factor for both, he offers his respectful obeisances to the form, although others may go on arguing about whether the Absolute has a form or not.</p>
<p>In this verse the word yoga-sankhyayoh is very important.</p>
<p>Yoga means bhakti-yoga because yogis also accept the existence of the all-pervading Supreme Soul and try to see that Supreme Soul within their hearts.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.13.1), dhyanavasthita-tad-gatena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah.</p>
<p>The devotee tries to come directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the yogi tries to find the Supersoul within the heart by meditation.</p>
<p>Thus, both directly and indirectly, yoga means bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Sankhya, however, means physical study of the cosmic situation through speculative knowledge.</p>
<p>This is generally known as jnana-sastra.</p>
<p>The Sankhyites are attached to the impersonal Brahman, but the Absolute Truth is known in three ways.</p>
<p>Brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate: the Absolute Truth is one, but some accept Him as impersonal Brahman, some as the Supersoul existing everywhere, and some as Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The central point is the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Although the impersonalists and personalists fight with one another, they focus upon the same Parabrahman, the same Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>In the yoga-sastras, Krsna is described as follows: krsnam pisangambaram ambujeksanam catur-bhujam sankha-gadady-udayudham.</p>
<p>Thus the pleasing appearance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s bodily features, His limbs and His dress are described.</p>
<p>The sankhya-sastra, however, denies the existence of the Lord’s transcendental form.</p>
<p>The sankhya-sastra says that the Supreme Absolute Truth has no hands, no legs and no name: hy anama-rupa-guna-pani-padam acaksur asrotram ekam advitiyam api nama-rupadikam nasti.</p>
<p>The Vedic mantras say, apani-pado javano grahita: the Supreme Lord has no legs and hands, but He can accept whatever is offered to Him.</p>
<p>Actually such statements accept that the Supreme has hands and legs, but deny that He has material hands and legs.</p>
<p>This is why the Absolute is called aprakrta.</p>
<p>Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has a sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), a form of eternity, knowledge and bliss, not a material form.</p>
<p>The Sankhyites, or jnanis, deny the material form, and the devotees also know very well that the Absolute Truth, Bhagavan, has no material form isvarah paramah krsnah</p>
<p>sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah</p>
<p>anadir adir govindah</p>
<p>sarva-karana-karanam</p>
<p>(Bs.5.1)</p>
<p>Krsna, who is known as Govinda, is the supreme controller.</p>
<p>He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body.</p>
<p>He is the origin of all.</p>
<p>He has no other origin, for He is the prime cause of all causes The conception of the Absolute without hands and legs and the conception of the Absolute with hands and legs are apparently contradictory, but they both coincide with the same truth about the Supreme Absolute Person.</p>
<p>Therefore the word vastu-nisthayoh, which is used herein, indicates that both the yogis and Sankhyites have faith in the reality, but are arguing about it from the different viewpoints of material and spiritual identities.</p>
<p>Parabrahman, or brhat, is the common point.</p>
<p>The Sankhyites and yogis are both situated in that same Brahman, but they differ because of different angles of vision.</p>
<p>The directions given by the bhakti-sastra point one in the perfect direction because the Supreme Personality of Godhead says in Bhagavad-gita, bhaktya mam abhijanati: (Bg.18.55) Only by devotional service am I to be known The bhaktas know that the Supreme Person has no material form, whereas the jnanis simply deny the material form.</p>
<p>One should therefore take shelter of the bhakti-marga, the path of devotion; then everything will be clear.</p>
<p>Jnanis concentrate on the virat-rupa, the gigantic universal form of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is a good system in the beginning for those who are extremely materialistic, but there is no need to think continuously of the virat-rupa.</p>
<p>When Arjuna was shown the virat-rupa of Krsna, he saw it, but he did not want to see it perpetually.</p>
<p>He therefore requested the Lord to return to His original form as two-armed Krsna.</p>
<p>In conclusion, learned scholars find no contradictions in the devotees’ concentration upon the spiritual form of the Lord (isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah (Bs.5.1)).</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya says that less intelligent nondevotees think that their conclusion is the ultimate, but because devotees are completely learned, they can understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—who (the Supreme Personality of Godhead); anugraha-artham—to show His causeless mercy; bhajatam—to the devotees who always render devotional service; pada-mulam—to His transcendental lotus feet; anama—with no material name; rupah—or material form; bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead; anantah—unlimited, all-pervading and eternally existing; namani—transcendental holy names; rupani—His transcendental forms; ca—also; janma-karmabhih—with His transcendental birth and activities; bheje—manifests; sah—He; mahyam—unto me; paramah—the Supreme; prasidatu—may He be merciful.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is inconceivably opulent, who is devoid of all material names, forms and pastimes, and who is all-pervading, is especially merciful to the devotees who worship His lotus feet.</p>
<p>Thus He exhibits transcendental forms and names with His different pastimes.</p>
<p>May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal and full of knowledge and bliss, be merciful to me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In regard to the significant word anama-rupah, Sri Sridhara Svami says, prakrta-nama-rupa-rahito ’pi.</p>
<p>The word anama, which means having no name indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material name.</p>
<p>Simply by chanting the name of Narayana to call his son, Ajamila attained salvation.</p>
<p>This means that Narayana is not an ordinary mundane name; it is nonmaterial.</p>
<p>The word anama, therefore, indicates that the names of the Supreme Lord do not belong to this material world.</p>
<p>The vibration of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra is not a material sound, and similarly the form of the Lord and His appearance and activities are all nonmaterial.</p>
<p>To show His causeless mercy to the devotees, as well as to the nondevotees, Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in this material world with names, forms and pastimes, all of which are transcendental.</p>
<p>Unintelligent men who cannot understand this think that these names, forms and pastimes are material, and therefore they deny that He has a name or a form.</p>
<p>Considered with scrutiny, the conclusion of nondevotees, who say that God has no name, and that of devotees, who know that His name is not material, are practically the same.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material name, form, birth, appearance or disappearance, but nevertheless, He takes His birth (janma).</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.6):</p>
<p>ajo ’pi sann avyayatma</p>
<p>bhutanam isvaro ’pi san</p>
<p>prakrtim svam adhisthaya</p>
<p>sambhavamy atma-mayaya</p>
<p>Although the Lord is unborn (aja) and His body never undergoes material changes, He nevertheless appears as an incarnation, maintaining Himself always in the transcendental stage (suddha-sattva).</p>
<p>Thus He exhibits His transcendental forms, names and activities.</p>
<p>That is His special mercy toward His devotees.</p>
<p>Others may continue merely arguing about whether the Absolute Truth has form or not, but when a devotee, by the grace of the Lord, sees the Lord personally, he becomes spiritually ecstatic.</p>
<p>Unintelligent persons say that the Lord does nothing.</p>
<p>Actually He has nothing to do, but nevertheless He has to do everything, because without His sanction no one can do anything.</p>
<p>The unintelligent, however, cannot see how He is working and how the entire material nature is working under His direction.</p>
<p>His different potencies work perfectly:</p>
<p>na tasya karyam karanam ca vidyate</p>
<p>na tat-samas cabhyadhikas ca drsyate</p>
<p>parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate</p>
<p>svabhaviki jnana-bala-kriya ca</p>
<p>(Svetasvatara Upanisad6.8)</p>
<p>He has nothing to do personally, for since His potencies are perfect, everything is immediately done by His will.</p>
<p>Persons to whom the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not revealed cannot see how He is working, and therefore they think that even if there is God, He has nothing to do or has no particular name.</p>
<p>Actually the Lord’s name already exists because of His transcendental activities.</p>
<p>The Lord is sometimes called guna-karma-nama because He is named according to His transcendental activities.</p>
<p>For example, Krsna means all-attractive This is the Lord’s name because His transcendental qualities make Him very attractive.</p>
<p>As a small boy He lifted Govardhana Hill, and in His childhood He killed many demons.</p>
<p>Such activities are very attractive, and therefore He is sometimes called Giridhari, Madhusudana, Agha-nisudana and so on.</p>
<p>Because He acted as the son of Nanda Maharaja, He is called Nanda-tanuja.</p>
<p>These names already exist, but since nondevotees cannot understand the names of the Lord, He is sometimes called anama, or nameless.</p>
<p>This means that He has no material names.</p>
<p>All His activities are spiritual, and therefore He has spiritual names.</p>
<p>Generally, less intelligent men are under the impression that the Lord has no form.</p>
<p>Therefore He appears in His original form as Krsna, sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), to carry out His mission of participating in the Battle of Kuruksetra and pastimes to protect the devotees and vanquish the demons (paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)).</p>
<p>This is His mercy.</p>
<p>For those who think that He has no form and no work to do, Krsna comes to show that indeed He works.</p>
<p>He works so gloriously that no one else can perform such uncommon acts.</p>
<p>Although He appeared as a human being, He married 16,108 wives, which is impossible for a human being to do.</p>
<p>The Lord performs such activities to show people how great He is, how affectionate He is and how merciful He is.</p>
<p>Although His original name is Krsna (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam), He acts in unlimited ways, and therefore according to His work He has many, many thousands of names.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As the air carries various characteristics of the physical elements, like the aroma of a flower or colors resulting from a mixture of dust in the air, the Lord appears through lower systems of worship according to one’s desires, although He appears as the demigods and not in His original form.</p>
<p>What is the use of these other forms? May the original Supreme Personality of Godhead please fulfill my desires.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The impersonalists imagine the various demigods to be forms of the Lord.</p>
<p>For example, the Mayavadis worship five demigods (pancopasana).</p>
<p>They do not actually believe in the form of the Lord, but for the sake of worship they imagine some form to be God.</p>
<p>Generally they imagine a form of Visnu, a form of Siva, and forms of Ganesa, the sun-god and Durga.</p>
<p>This is called pancopasana.</p>
<p>Daksa, however, wanted to worship not an imaginary form, but the supreme form of Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura describes the difference between the Supreme Personality of Godhead and an ordinary living being.</p>
<p>As pointed out in a previous verse, sarvam puman veda gunams ca taj-jno na veda sarva jnam anantam ide: the omnipotent Supreme Lord knows everything, but the living being does not actually know the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita, I know everything, but no one knows Me This is the difference between the Supreme Lord and an ordinary living being.</p>
<p>In a prayer in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Queen Kunti says, My dear Lord, You exist inside and outside, yet no one can see You The conditioned soul cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead by speculative knowledge or by imagination.</p>
<p>One must therefore know the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He reveals Himself, but He cannot be understood by speculation.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.29):</p>
<p>athapi te deva padambuja-dvaya-</p>
<p>prasada-lesanugrhita eva hi</p>
<p>janati tattvam bhagavan-mahimno</p>
<p>na canya eko ’pi ciram vicinvan</p>
<p>My Lord, if one is favored by even a slight trace of the mercy of Your lotus feet, he can understand the greatness of Your personality.</p>
<p>But those who speculate to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead are unable to know You, even though they continue to study the Vedas for many years This is the verdict of the sastra.</p>
<p>An ordinary man may be a great philosopher and may speculate upon what the Absolute Truth is, what His form is and where He is existing, but be cannot understand these truths.</p>
<p>Sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah: one can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead only through devotional service.</p>
<p>This is also explained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself in Bhagavad-gita (18.55).</p>
<p>Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: One can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is only by devotional service Unintelligent persons want to imagine or concoct a form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but devotees want to worship the actual Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore Daksa prays, One may think of You as personal, impersonal or imaginary, but I wish to pray to Your Lordship that You fulfill my desires to see You as You actually are Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that this verse is especially meant for the impersonalist, who thinks that he himself is the Supreme because there is no difference between the living being and God.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi philosopher thinks that there is only one Supreme Truth and that he is also that Supreme Truth.</p>
<p>Actually this is not knowledge but foolishness, and this verse is especially meant for such fools, whose knowledge has been stolen by illusion (mayayapahrta jnanah).</p>
<p>Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that such persons, jnani-maninah, think themselves very advanced, but actually they are unintelligent.</p>
<p>In regard to this verse, Srila Madhvacarya says:</p>
<p>svadeha-stham harim prahur</p>
<p>adhama jivam eva tu</p>
<p>madhyamas capy anirnitam</p>
<p>jivad bhinnam janardanam</p>
<p>There are three classes of men—the lowest (adhama), those in the middle (madhyama), and the best (uttama).</p>
<p>The lowest (adhama) think that there is no difference between God and the living entity except that the living entity is under designations whereas the Absolute Truth has no designations.</p>
<p>In their opinion, as soon as the designations of the material body are dissolved, the jiva, the living entity, will mix with the Supreme.</p>
<p>They give the argument of ghatakasa-patakasa, in which the body is compared to a pot with the sky within and the sky without.</p>
<p>When the pot breaks, the sky inside becomes one with the sky outside, and so the impersonalists say that the living being becomes one with the Supreme.</p>
<p>This is their argument, but Srila Madhvacarya says that such an argument is put forward by the lowest class of men.</p>
<p>Another class of men cannot ascertain what the actual form of the Supreme is, but they agree that there is a Supreme who controls the activities of the ordinary living being.</p>
<p>Such philosophers are accepted as mediocre.</p>
<p>The best, however are those who understand the Supreme Lord (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1)).</p>
<p>Purnanandadi-gunakam sarva jiva-vilaksanam: His form is completely spiritual, full of bliss, and completely distinct from that of the conditioned soul or any other living entity.</p>
<p>Uttamas tu harim prahus taratamyena tesu ca: such philosophers are the best because they know that the Supreme Personality of Godhead reveals Himself differently to worshipers in various modes of material nature.</p>
<p>They know that there are thirty-three million demigods just to convince the conditioned soul that there is a supreme power and to induce him to agree to worship one of these demigods so that by the association of devotees he may be able to understand that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita, mattah parataram nanyat kincid asti dhananjaya: (Bg.7.7) There is no truth superior to Me Aham adir hi devanam: I am the origin of all the demigods Aham sarvasya prabhavah: I am superior to everyone, even Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and the other demigods These are the conclusions of the sastra, and one who accepts these conclusions should be considered a first-class philosopher.</p>
<p>Such a philosopher knows that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord of the demigods (deva-devesvaram sutram anandam prana-vedinah).</p>

<p>O Maharaja Pariksit, best of the Kuru dynasty, the Lord’s lotus feet rested on the shoulders of His carrier, Garuda, and He appeared with eight long, mighty, very beautiful arms.</p>
<p>In His hands He held a disc, conchshell, sword, shield, arrow, bow, rope and club—in each hand a different weapon, all brilliantly shining.</p>
<p>His garments were yellow and His bodily hue deep bluish.</p>
<p>His eyes and face were very cheerful, and from His neck to His feet hung a long garland of flowers.</p>
<p>His chest was decorated with the Kaustubha jewel and the mark of Srivatsa.</p>
<p>On His head was a gorgeous round helmet, and His ears were decorated with earrings resembling sharks.</p>
<p>All these ornaments were uncommonly beautiful.</p>
<p>The Lord wore a golden belt on His waist, bracelets on His arms, rings on His fingers, and ankle bells on His feet.</p>
<p>Thus decorated by various ornaments, Lord Hari, who is attractive to all the living entities of the three worlds, is known as Purusottama, the best personality.</p>
<p>He was accompanied by great devotees like Narada, Nanda and all the principal demigods, led by the heavenly king, Indra, and the residents of various upper planetary systems such as Siddhaloka, Gandharvaloka and Caranaloka.</p>

<p>After every dissolution of the material cosmos, all the living entities take shelter in the body of Karanodakasayi Visnu, and when creation takes place again, they come forth from His body in their various species to resume their activities.</p>
<p>Why does the creation take place in such a way that the living entities are put into conditioned life to suffer the threefold miseries imposed upon them by the material nature? Here the Lord says to Daksa, You desire to benefit all living entities, and that is also My desire The living entities who come in contact with the material world are meant to be corrected.</p>
<p>All the living entities within this material world have revolted against the service of the Lord, and therefore they remain within this material world as ever conditioned, nitya-baddha, taking birth again and again.</p>
<p>There is a chance, of course, of their being liberated, but nevertheless the conditioned souls, not taking advantage of this opportunity, continue in a life of sense enjoyment, and thus they are punished by birth and death again and again.</p>
<p>This is the law of nature.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):</p>
<p>daivi hy esa guna-mayi</p>
<p>mama maya duratyaya</p>
<p>mam eva ye prapadyante</p>
<p>mayam etam taranti te</p>
<p>This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (15.7) the Lord says:</p>
<p>mamaivamso jiva-loke</p>
<p>jiva-bhutah sanatanah</p>
<p>manah sasthanindriyani</p>
<p>prakrti-sthani karsati</p>
<p>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts.</p>
<p>Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind The living entity’s struggle for existence within the material world is due to his rebellious nature.</p>
<p>Unless a living entity surrenders to Krsna, he must continue this life of struggle.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is not a fad.</p>
<p>It is a bona fide movement intended to promote the welfare of all conditioned souls by trying to elevate everyone to the platform of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>If one does not come to this platform, he must continue in material existence perpetually, sometimes in the upper planets and sometimes in the lower planets.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya20.118), kabhu svarge uthaya, kabhu narake dubaya: the conditioned soul sometimes descends into nescience and sometimes gets some relief by being relatively freed from it.</p>
<p>This is the life of the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa is trying to benefit the conditioned souls by begetting them to give them a life with a chance for liberation.</p>
<p>Liberation means surrender to Krsna.</p>
<p>If one begets children with the purpose of training them to surrender to Krsna, fatherhood is very good.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the spiritual master trains the conditioned souls to become Krsna conscious, his position is successful.</p>
<p>If one gives the conditioned souls a chance to become Krsna conscious, all his activities are approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is extremely pleased, as stated here (prito ’ham).</p>
<p>Following the examples of the previous acaryas, all the members of the Krsna consciousness movement should try to benefit the conditioned souls by inducing them to become Krsna conscious and giving them all facilities to do so.</p>
<p>Such activities constitute real welfare work.</p>
<p>By such activities, a preacher or anyone who endeavors to spread Krsna consciousness is recognized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (18.68–69):</p>
<p>ya idam paramam guhyam</p>
<p>mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati</p>
<p>bhaktim mayi param krtva</p>
<p>mam evaisyaty asamsayah</p>
<p>na ca tasman manusyesu</p>
<p>kascin me priya-krttamah</p>
<p>bhavita na ca me tasmad</p>
<p>anyah priyataro bhuvi</p>
<p>For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.</p>
<p>There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>brahma—Lord Brahma; bhavah—Lord Siva; bhavantah—all of you prajapatis; ca—and; manavah—the Manus; vibudha-isvarah—all the different demigods (such as the sun, the moon, Venus, Mars and Jupiter, who are all in charge of various activities for the welfare of the world); vibhutayah—expansions of energy; mama—My; hi—indeed; etah—all these; bhutanam—of all the living entities; bhuti—of welfare; hetavah—causes.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, the Manus, all the other demigods in the higher planetary systems, and you prajapatis, who are increasing the population, are working for the benefit of all living entities.</p>
<p>Thus you expansions of My marginal energy are incarnations of My various qualities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of incarnations or expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The expansions of His personal self, or visnu-tattva, are called svamsa expansions, whereas the living entities, who are not visnu-tattva but jiva-tattva, are called vibhinnamsa, separated expansions.</p>
<p>Although Prajapati Daksa is not on the same level as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, he is compared to them because he engages in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>In the service of the Personality of Godhead, it is not that Lord Brahma is considered very great while an ordinary human being trying to preach the glories of the Lord is considered very low.</p>
<p>There are no such distinctions.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether materially high or materially low, anyone engaged in the service of the Lord is spiritually very dear to Him.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya gives this quotation from the Tantra-nirnaya:</p>
<p>visesa-vyakti-patratvad</p>
<p>brahmadyas tu vibhutayah</p>
<p>tad-antaryaminas caiva</p>
<p>matsyadya vibhavah smrtah</p>
<p>From Lord Brahma down, all the living entities engaged in the service of the Lord are extraordinary and are called vibhuti.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.41):</p>
<p>yad yad vibhutimat sattvam</p>
<p>srimad urjitam eva va</p>
<p>tat tad evavagaccha tvam</p>
<p>mama tejo-’msa-sambhavam</p>
<p>Know that all beautiful, glorious and mighty creations spring from but a spark of My splendor A living entity especially empowered to act on behalf of the Lord is called vibhuti, whereas the visnu-tattva incarnations of the Lord, such as the Matsya avatara (kesava dhrta-mina-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare), are called vibhava.</p>

<p>angani kratavo jata</p>
<p>dharma atmasavah surah</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>tapah—austerities like mental control, mystic yoga and meditation; me—My; hrdayam—heart; brahman—O brahmana; tanuh—the body; vidya—the knowledge derived from Vedic scripture; kriya—spiritual activities; akrtih—form; angani—the limbs of the body; kratavah—the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices mentioned in the Vedic literature; jatah—completed; dharmah—the religious principles for executing the ritualistic ceremonies; atma—My soul; asavah—life airs; surah—the demigods who execute My orders in different departments of the material world.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear brahmana, austerity in the form of meditation is My heart, Vedic knowledge in the form of hymns and mantras constitutes My body, and spiritual activities and ecstatic emotions are My actual form.</p>
<p>The ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices, when properly conducted, are the various limbs of My body, the unseen good fortune proceeding from pious or spiritual activities constitutes My mind, and the demigods who execute My orders in various departments are My life and soul.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes atheists argue that since God is invisible to their eyes, they do not believe in God.</p>
<p>For them the Supreme Lord is describing a method by which one can see God in His impersonal form.</p>
<p>Intelligent persons can see God in His personal form, as stated in the sastras, but if one is very eager to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead immediately, face to face, he can see the Supreme Lord through this description, which portrays the various internal and external parts of His body.</p>
<p>To engage in tapasya, or denial of material activities, is the first principle of spiritual life.</p>
<p>Then there are spiritual activities, such as the performance of Vedic ritualistic sacrifices, study of the Vedic knowledge, meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and chanting of the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>One should also respect the demigods and understand how they are situated, how they act and how they manage the activities of the various departments of this material world.</p>
<p>In this way one can see how God is existing and how everything is managed perfectly because of the presence of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.10):</p>
<p>mayadhyaksena prakrtih</p>
<p>suyate sa-caracaram</p>
<p>hetunanena kaunteya</p>
<p>jagad viparivartate</p>
<p>This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and nonmoving beings.</p>
<p>By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again If one is unable to see the Supreme Lord although He is present as Krsna in His various incarnations, one may see the Supreme Lord’s impersonal feature, according to the direction of the Vedas, by seeing the activities of material nature.</p>
<p>Anything done under the direction of the Vedic injunctions is called dharma, as described by the order carriers of Yamaraja (Bhag.6.1.40):</p>
<p>veda-pranihito dharmo</p>
<p>hy adharmas tad-viparyayah</p>
<p>vedo narayanah saksat</p>
<p>svayambhur iti susruma</p>
<p>That which is prescribed in the Vedas constitutes dharma, the religious principles, and the opposite of that is irreligion.</p>
<p>The Vedas are directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, and are self-born.</p>
<p>This we have heard from Yamaraja In this connection, Srila Madhvacarya comments:</p>
<p>tapo ’bhimani rudras tu</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Before the creation of this cosmic manifestation, I alone existed with My specific spiritual potencies.</p>
<p>Consciousness was then unmanifested, just as one’s consciousness is unmanifested during the time of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word aham indicates a person.</p>
<p>As explained in the Vedas, nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam: the Lord is the supreme eternal among innumerable eternals and the supreme living being among the innumerable living beings.</p>
<p>The Lord is a person who also has impersonal features.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):</p>
<p>vadanti tat tattva-vidas</p>
<p>tattvam yaj jnanam advayam</p>
<p>brahmeti paramatmeti</p>
<p>bhagavan iti sabdyate</p>
<p>Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan Consideration of the Paramatma and impersonal Brahman arose after the creation; before the creation, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead existed.</p>
<p>As firmly declared in Bhagavad-gita (18.55), the Lord can be understood only by bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>The ultimate cause, the supreme cause of creation, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who can be understood only by bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>He cannot be understood by speculative philosophical research or by meditation, since all such processes came into existence after the material creation.</p>
<p>The impersonal and localized conceptions of the Supreme Lord are more or less materially contaminated.</p>
<p>The real spiritual process, therefore, is bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>As the Lord says, bhaktya mam abhijanati: (Bg.18.55) Only by devotional service can I be understood Before the creation, the Lord existed as a person, as indicated here by the word aham.</p>
<p>When Prajapati Daksa saw Him as a person, who was beautifully dressed and ornamented, he actually experienced the meaning of this word aham through devotional service.</p>
<p>Each person is eternal.</p>
<p>Because the Lord says that He existed as a person before the creation (agre) and will also exist after the annihilation, the Lord is a person eternally.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.9.13–14):</p>
<p>na cantar na bahir yasya</p>
<p>na purvam napi caparam</p>
<p>purvaparam bahis cantar</p>
<p>jagato yo jagac ca yah</p>
<p>tam matvatmajam avyaktam</p>
<p>martya-lingam adhoksajam</p>
<p>gopikolukhale damna</p>
<p>babandha prakrtam yatha</p>
<p>The Personality of Godhead appeared in Vrndavana as the son of mother Yasoda, who bound the Lord with rope just as an ordinary mother binds a material child.</p>
<p>There are actually no divisions of external and internal for the form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1)), but when He appears in His own form the unintelligent think Him an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: (Bg.9.11) although He comes in His own body, which never changes mudhas, the unintelligent, think that the impersonal Brahman has assumed a material body to come in the form of a person.</p>
<p>Ordinary living beings assume material bodies, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead does not.</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme consciousness, it is stated herein that samjnana-matram, the original consciousness, Krsna consciousness, was unmanifested before the creation, although the consciousness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of everything.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (2.12), Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be Thus the Lord’s person is the Absolute Truth in the past, present and future.</p>
<p>In this regard, Madhvacarya quotes two verses from the Matsya Purana:</p>
<p>nana-varno haris tv eko</p>
<p>bahu-sirsa-bhujo rupat</p>
<p>asil laye tad-anyat tu</p>
<p>suksma-rupam sriyam vina</p>
<p>asuptah supta iva ca</p>
<p>militakso ’bhavad dharih</p>
<p>anyatranadarad visnau</p>
<p>sris ca lineva kathyate</p>
<p>suksmatvena harau sthanal</p>
<p>linam anyad apisyate</p>
<p>After the annihilation of everything, the Supreme Lord, because of His sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), remains in His original form, but since the other living entities have material bodies, the matter merges into matter, and the subtle form of the spirit soul remains within the body of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord does not sleep, but the ordinary living entities remain asleep until the next creation.</p>
<p>An unintelligent person thinks that the opulence of the Supreme Lord is nonexistent after the annihilation, but that is not a fact.</p>
<p>The opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead remains as it is in the spiritual world; only in the material world is everything dissolved.</p>
<p>Brahma-lina, merging into the Supreme Brahman, is not actual lina, or annihilation, for the subtle form remaining in the Brahman effulgence will return to the material world after the material creation and again assume a material form.</p>
<p>This is described as bhutva bhutva praliyate.</p>
<p>When the material body is annihilated, the spirit soul remains in a subtle form, which later assumes another material body.</p>
<p>This is true for the conditioned souls, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead remains eternally in His original consciousness and spiritual body.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is a description of the history of the universal creation.</p>
<p>The first cause is the Lord Himself, the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>From Him, Brahma is created, and Brahma takes charge of the affairs of the universe.</p>
<p>The universal affairs of the material creation depend upon the material energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is therefore the cause of the material creation.</p>
<p>The entire cosmic manifestation is described herein as guna-vigrahah, the form of the Lord’s qualities.</p>
<p>From the cosmic universal form, the first creation is Lord Brahma, who is the cause of all living entities.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Madhvacarya describes the unlimited attributes of the Lord:</p>
<p>praty-ekaso gunanam tu</p>

<p>When the chief lord of the universe, Lord Brahma (Svayambhu), having been inspired by My energy, was attempting to create, he thought himself incapable.</p>
<p>Therefore I gave him advice, and in accordance with My instructions he underwent extremely difficult austerities.</p>
<p>Because of these austerities, the great Lord Brahma was able to create nine personalities, including you, to help him in the functions of creation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Nothing is possible without tapasya.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma, however, was empowered to create this entire universe because of his austerities.</p>
<p>The more we engage in austerities, the more we become powerful by the grace of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore Rsabhadeva advised His sons, tapo divyam putraka yena sattvam suddhyed: One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service.</p>
<p>By such activity, one’s heart is purified (Bhag.5.5.1) In our material existence we are impure, and therefore we cannot do anything wonderful, but if we purify our existence by tapasya, we can do wonderful things by the grace of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Now unite in sexual life as man and woman, and in this way, by sexual intercourse, you will be able to beget hundreds of children in the womb of this girl to increase the population.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.11), dharmaviruddho bhutesu kamo ’smi: I am sex that is not contrary to religious principles Sexual intercourse ordained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is dharma, a religious principle, but it is not intended for sense enjoyment.</p>
<p>Indulgence in sense enjoyment through sexual intercourse is not allowed by the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>One may follow the natural tendency for sex life only to beget children.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord told Daksa in this verse, This girl is offered to you only for sex life to beget children, not for any other purpose.</p>
<p>She is very fertile, and therefore you will be able to have as many children as you can beget Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks in this connection that Daksa was given the facility for unlimited sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>In Daksa’s previous life he was also known as Daksa, but in the course of performing sacrifices he offended Lord Siva, and thus his head was replaced with that of a goat.</p>
<p>Then Daksa gave up his life because of his degraded condition, but because he maintained the same unlimited sexual desires, he underwent austerities by which he satisfied the Supreme Lord, who then gave him unlimited potency for sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>It should be noted that although such a facility for sexual intercourse is achieved by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this facility is not offered to advanced devotees, who are free from material desires (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Madhya 19.167)).</p>
<p>In this connection it may be noted that if the American boys and girls engaged in the Krsna consciousness movement want to advance in Krsna consciousness to achieve the supreme benefit of loving service to the Lord, they should refrain from indulging in this facility for sex life.</p>
<p>Therefore we advise that one should at least refrain from illicit sex.</p>
<p>Even if there are opportunities for sex life, one should voluntarily accept the limitation of having sex only for progeny, not for any other purpose.</p>
<p>Kardama Muni was also given the facility for sex life, but he had only a slight desire for it.</p>
<p>Therefore after begetting children in the womb of Devahuti, Kardama Muni became completely renounced.</p>
<p>The purport is that if one wants to return home, back to Godhead, one should voluntarily refrain from sex life.</p>
<p>Sex should be accepted only as much as needed, not unlimitedly.</p>
<p>One should not think that Daksa received the favor of the Lord by receiving the facilities for unlimited sex.</p>
<p>Later verses will reveal that Daksa again committed an offense, this time at the lotus feet of Narada.</p>
<p>Therefore although sex life is the topmost enjoyment in the material world and although one may have an opportunity for sexual enjoyment by the grace of God, this entails a risk of committing offenses.</p>
<p>Daksa was open to such offenses, and therefore, strictly speaking, he was not actually favored by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>One should not seek the favor of the Lord for unlimited potency in sex life.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-4" id="summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#65" id="65">6.5</a></h3>
<p>This chapter relates how all the sons of Daksa were delivered from the clutches of the material energy by following the advice of Narada, who was therefore cursed by Daksa.</p>
<p>Influenced by the external energy of Lord Visnu, Prajapati Daksa begot ten thousand sons in the womb of his wife, Pancajani.</p>
<p>These sons, who were all of the same character and mentality, were known as the Haryasvas.</p>
<p>Ordered by their father to create more and more population, the Haryasvas went west to the place where the River Sindhu (now the Indus) meets the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>In those days this was the site of a holy lake named Narayana-saras, where there were many saintly persons.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas began practicing austerities, penances and meditation, which are the engagements of the highly exalted renounced order of life.</p>
<p>However, when Srila Narada Muni saw these boys engaged in such commendable austerities simply for material creation, he thought it better to release them from this tendency.</p>
<p>Narada Muni described to the boys their ultimate goal of life and advised them not to become ordinary karmis to beget children.</p>
<p>Thus all the sons of Daksa became enlightened and left, never to return.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa, who was very sad at the loss of his sons, begot one thousand more sons in the womb of his wife, Pancajani, and ordered them to increase progeny.</p>
<p>These sons, who were named the Savalasvas, also engaged in worshiping Lord Visnu to beget children, but Narada Muni convinced them to become mendicants and not beget children.</p>
<p>Foiled twice in his attempts to increase population, Prajapati Daksa became most angry at Narada Muni and cursed him, saying that in the future he would not be able to stay anywhere.</p>
<p>Since Narada Muni, being fully qualified, was fixed in tolerance, he accepted Daksa’s curse.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Narada said: My dear Haryasvas, you have not seen the extremities of the earth.</p>
<p>There is a kingdom where only one man lives and where there is a hole from which, having entered, no one emerges.</p>
<p>A woman there who is extremely unchaste adorns herself with various attractive dresses, and the man who lives there is her husband.</p>
<p>In that kingdom, there is a river flowing in both directions, a wonderful home made of twenty-five materials, a swan that vibrates various sounds, and an automatically revolving object made of sharp razors and thunderbolts.</p>
<p>You have not seen all this, and therefore you are inexperienced boys without advanced knowledge.</p>
<p>How, then, will you create progeny?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Narada Muni saw that the boys known as the Haryasvas were already purified because of living in that holy place and were practically ready for liberation.</p>
<p>Why then should they be encouraged to become entangled in family life, which is so dark that once having entered it one cannot leave it? Through this analogy, Narada Muni asked them to consider why they should follow their father’s order to be entangled in family life.</p>
<p>Indirectly, he asked them to find within the cores of their hearts the situation of the Supersoul, Lord Visnu, for then they would truly be experienced.</p>
<p>In other words, one who is too involved in his material environment and does not look within the core of his heart is increasingly entangled in the illusory energy.</p>
<p>Narada Muni’s purpose was to get the sons of Prajapati Daksa to divert their attention toward spiritual realization instead of involving themselves in the ordinary but complicated affairs of propagation.</p>
<p>The same advice was given by Prahlada Maharaja to his father (Bhag.7.5.5):</p>
<p>tat sadhu manye ’sura-varya dehinam</p>
<p>sada samudvigna-dhiyam asad-grahat</p>
<p>hitvatma-patam grham andha-kupam</p>
<p>vanam gato yad dharim asrayeta</p>
<p>In the dark well of family life, one is always full of anxiety because of having accepted a temporary body.</p>
<p>If one wants to free himself from this anxiety, one should immediately leave family life and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Narada Muni advised the Haryasvas not to enter household life.</p>
<p>Since they were already advanced in spiritual knowledge, why should they be entangled in that way?</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>(The Haryasvas understood the meaning of Narada’s words as follows.) The word bhu (the eart)</p>
<p>refers to the field of activities.</p>
<p>The material body, which is a result of the living being’s actions, is his field of activities, and it gives him false designations.</p>
<p>Since time immemorial, he has received various types of material bodies, which are the roots of bondage to the material world.</p>
<p>If one foolishly engages in temporary fruitive activities and does not look toward the cessation of this bondage, what will be the benefit of his actions?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Narada Muni spoke to the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, about ten allegorical subjects—the king, the kingdom, the river, the house, the physical elements and so forth.</p>
<p>After considering these by themselves, the Haryasvas could understand that the living entity encaged in his body seeks happiness, but takes no interest in how to become free from his encagement.</p>
<p>This is a very important verse, since all the living entities in the material world are very active, having obtained their particular types of bodies.</p>
<p>A man works all day and night for sense gratification, and animals like hogs and dogs also work for sense gratification all day and night.</p>
<p>Birds, beasts and all other conditioned living entities engage in various activities without knowledge of the soul encaged within the body.</p>
<p>Especially in the human form of body, one’s duty is to act in such a way that he can release himself from his encagement, but without the instructions of Narada or his representative in the disciplic succession, people blindly engage in bodily activities to enjoy maya-sukha—flickering, temporary happiness.</p>
<p>They do not know how to become free from their material encagement.</p>
<p>Rsabhadeva therefore said that such activity is not at all good, since it encages the soul again and again in a body subjected to the threefold miseries of the material condition.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, could immediately understand the purport of Narada’s instructions.</p>
<p>Our Krsna consciousness movement is especially meant for such enlightenment.</p>
<p>We are trying to enlighten humanity so that people may come to the understanding that they should work hard in tapasya for self-realization and freedom from the continuous bondage of birth, death, old age and disease in one body after another.</p>
<p>Maya, however, is very strong; she is expert in putting impediments in the way of this understanding.</p>
<p>Therefore sometimes one comes to the Krsna consciousness movement but again falls into the clutches of maya, not understanding the importance of this movement.</p>

<p>He is full of six opulences and fully independent of everyone else.</p>
<p>He is never subject to the three modes of material nature, for He is always transcendental to this material creation.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Narada Muni had mentioned a kingdom where there is only one king with no competitor.</p>
<p>The complete spiritual world, and specifically the cosmic manifestation, has only one proprietor or enjoyer—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is beyond this material manifestation.</p>
<p>The Lord has therefore been described as turya, existing on the fourth platform.</p>
<p>He has also been described as abhava.</p>
<p>The word bhava, which means takes birth comes from the word bhu, to be As stated in Bhagavad-gita (8.19), bhutva bhutva praliyate: the living entities in the material world must be repeatedly born and destroyed.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is neither bhutva nor praliyate; He is eternal.</p>
<p>In other words, He is not obliged to take birth like human beings or animals, which repeatedly take birth and die because of ignorance of the soul.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is not subjected to such changes of body, and one who thinks otherwise is considered a fool (avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam (Bg.9.11)).</p>
<p>Narada Muni advises that human beings not waste their time simply jumping like cats and monkeys, without real benefit.</p>
<p>The duty of the human being is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>The Haryasvas understood the meaning of this allegory.) Hardly once has a person who has entered the lower planetary system called Patala been seen to return.</p>
<p>Similarly, if one enters the Vaikuntha-dhama (pratyag-dhama), he does not return to this material world.</p>
<p>If there is such a place, from which, having gone, one does not return to the miserable material condition of life, what is the use of jumping like monkeys in the temporary material world and not seeing or understanding that place? What will be the profit?</p>

<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (15.6), yad gatva na nivartante tad dhama paramam mama: there is a region from which, having gone, one does not return to the material world.</p>
<p>This region has been repeatedly described.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), Krsna says:</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna If one can properly understand Krsna, who has already been described as the Supreme King, he does not return here after giving up his material body.</p>
<p>This fact has been described in this verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Puman naivaiti yad gatva: he does not return to this material world, but returns home, back to Godhead, to live an eternally blissful life of knowledge.</p>
<p>Why do people not care about this? What will be the benefit of taking birth again in this material world, sometimes as a human being, sometimes a demigod and sometimes a cat or dog? What is the benefit of wasting time in this way? Krsna has very definitely asserted in Bhagavad-gita (8.15):</p>

<p>(Narada Muni had described a woman who is a professional prostitute.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas understood the identity of this woman.) Mixed with the mode of passion, the unsteady intelligence of every living entity is like a prostitute who changes dresses just to attract one’s attention.</p>
<p>If one fully engages in temporary fruitive activities, not understanding how this is taking place, what does he actually gain?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A woman who has no husband declares herself independent, which means that she becomes a prostitute.</p>
<p>A prostitute generally dresses herself in various fashions intended to attract a man’s attention to the lower part of her body.</p>
<p>Today it has become a much advertised fashion for a woman to go almost naked, covering the lower part of her body only slightly, in order to draw the attention of a man to her private parts for sexual enjoyment.</p>
<p>The intelligence engaged to attract a man to the lower part of the body is the intelligence of a professional prostitute.</p>
<p>Similarly, the intelligence of a living entity who does not turn his attention toward Krsna or the Krsna consciousness movement simply changes dresses like a prostitute.</p>
<p>What is the benefit of such foolish intelligence? One should be intelligently conscious in such a way that he need no longer change from one body to another.</p>
<p>Karmis change their professions at any moment, but a Krsna conscious person does not change his profession, for his only profession is to attract the attention of Krsna by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra and living a very simple life, without following daily changes of fashion.</p>
<p>In our Krsna consciousness movement, fashionable persons are taught to adopt one fashion—the dress of a Vaisnava with a shaved head and tilaka.</p>
<p>They are taught to be always clean in mind, dress and eating in order to be fixed in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>What is the use of changing one’s dress, sometimes wearing long hair and a long beard and sometimes dressing otherwise? This is not good.</p>
<p>One should not waste his time in such frivolous activities.</p>
<p>One should always be fixed in Krsna consciousness and take the cure of devotional service with firm determination.</p>

<p>Polluted intelligence has been compared to a prostitute.</p>
<p>One who has not purified his intelligence is said to be controlled by that prostitute.</p>

<p>Bahu-sakha hy anantas ca buddhayo ’vyavasayinam: one who is not fixed in proper intelligence discovers many modes of life.</p>
<p>Thus involved in material activities, he is exposed to the different modes of material nature and subjected to varieties of so-called happiness and distress.</p>
<p>If a man becomes the husband of a prostitute, he cannot be happy, and similarly one who follows the dictations of material intelligence and material consciousness will never be happy.</p>
<p>One must judiciously understand the activities of material nature.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.27):</p>
<p>prakrteh kriyamanani</p>
<p>gunaih karmani sarvasah</p>
<p>ahankara-vimudhatma</p>
<p>kartaham iti manyate</p>
<p>The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature Although one follows the dictations of material nature, he happily thinks himself the master or husband of material nature.</p>
<p>Scientists, for example, try to be the masters of material nature, life after life, not caring to understand the Supreme Person, under whose direction everything within this material world is moving.</p>
<p>Trying to be the masters of material nature, they are imitation gods who declare to the public that scientific advancement will one day be able to avoid the so-called control of God.</p>
<p>In fact, however, the living being, unable to control the rulings of God, is forced to associate with the prostitute of polluted intelligence and accept various material bodies.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (13.22):</p>
<p>purusah prakrti-stho hi</p>
<p>bhunkte prakrti-jan gunan</p>
<p>karanam guna-sango ’sya</p>
<p>sad-asad-yoni-janmasu</p>
<p>The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature.</p>
<p>This is due to his association with that material nature.</p>
<p>Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species If one fully engages in temporary fruitive activities and does not solve this real problem, what profit will he gain?</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>(Narada Muni had said that there is a river flowing in both directions.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas understood the purport of this statement.) Material nature functions in two ways—by creation and dissolution.</p>
<p>Thus the river of material nature flows both ways.</p>
<p>A living entity who unknowingly falls in this river is submerged in its waves, and since the current is swifter near the banks of the river, he is unable to get out.</p>
<p>What will be the benefit of performing fruitive activities in that river of maya?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One may be submerged in the waves of the river of maya, but one may also get free from the waves by coming to the banks of knowledge and austerity.</p>
<p>Near these banks, however, the waves are very strong.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.44) there is this statement:</p>
<p>srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka</p>
<p>chayeva yasya bhuvanani bibharti durga</p>
<p>The maya-sakti, Durga, is in charge of srsti-sthiti-pralaya, creation and dissolution, and she acts under the direction of the Supreme Lord (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram (Bg.9.10)).</p>
<p>When one falls in the river of nescience, he is always tossed here and there by the waves, but the same maya can also save him when be surrenders to Krsna, or becomes Krsna conscious.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness is knowledge and austerity.</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person takes knowledge from the Vedic literature, and at the same time he must practice austerities.</p>
<p>To attain freedom from material life, one must take to Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if one very busily engages in the so-called advancement of science, what benefit will he derive? If one is carried away by the waves of nature, what is the meaning of being a great scientist or philosopher? Mundane science and philosophy are also material creations.</p>
<p>One must understand how maya works and how one can be released from the tossing waves of the river of nescience.</p>
<p>That is one’s first duty.</p>

<p>(Narada Muni had said that there is a house made of twenty-five elements.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Philosophers and scientists conduct scholarly research to find the original cause, but they should do so scientifically, not whimsically or through fantastic theories.</p>
<p>The science of the original cause is explained in various Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>Athato brahma jijnasa/janmady asya yatah (Bhag.1.1.1).</p>
<p>The Vedanta-sutra explains that one should inquire about the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>Such inquiry about the Supreme is called brahma jijnasa.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):</p>
<p>vadanti tat tattva-vidas</p>
<p>tattvam yaj jnanam advayam</p>
<p>brahmeti paramatmeti</p>
<p>bhagavan iti sabdyate</p>
<p>Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan The Absolute Truth appears to neophytes as impersonal Brahman and to advanced mystic yogis as Paramatma, the Supersoul, but devotees, who are further advanced, understand the Absolute Truth as the Supreme Lord, Visnu.</p>
<p>This material cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the energy of Lord Krsna, or Lord Visnu eka-desa-sthitasyagner</p>
<p>jyotsna vistarini yatha</p>
<p>parasya brahmanah saktis</p>
<p>tathedam akhilam jagat</p>
<p>Whatever we see in this world is but an expansion of various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is like a fire that spreads illumination for a long distance although it is situated in one place (Visnu Purana) The entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore if one does not conduct research to find the supreme cause, but instead falsely engages in frivolous, temporary activities, what is the use of demanding recognition as an important scientist or philosopher? If one does not know the ultimate cause, what is the use of his scientific and philosophical research? The purusa, the original person—Bhagavan, Visnu—can be understood only by devotional service.</p>
<p>Bhaktya mam abhijanati yavan yas casmi tattvatah: (Bg.18.55) only by devotional service can one understand the Supreme Person, who is behind everything.</p>
<p>One must try to understand that the material elements are the separated, inferior energy of the Lord and that the living entity is the Lord’s spiritual energy.</p>
<p>Whatever we experience, including matter and the spirit soul, the living force, is but a combination of two energies of Lord Visnu—the inferior energy and the superior energy.</p>
<p>One should seriously study the facts concerning creation, maintenance and devastation, as well as the permanent place from which one never need return (yad gatva na nivartante (Bg.15.6)).</p>
<p>Human society should study this, but instead of culturing such knowledge, people are attracted to temporary happiness and sense gratification, culminating in bottomless, topless passion.</p>
<p>There is no profit in such activities; one must engage himself in the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>(Narada Muni had spoken of a swan.</p>
<p>That swan is explained in this verse.) The Vedic literatures (sastras) vividly describe how to understand the Supreme Lord, the source of all material and spiritual energy.</p>
<p>Indeed, they elaborately explain these two energies.</p>
<p>The swan (hamsa) is one who discriminates between matter and spirit, who accepts the essence of everything, and who explains the means of bondage and the means of liberation.</p>
<p>The words of scriptures consist of variegated vibrations.</p>
<p>If a foolish rascal leaves aside the study of these sastras to engage in temporary activities, what will be the result?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is very eager to present Vedic literature in modern languages, especially Western languages such as English, French and German.</p>
<p>The leaders of the Western world, the Americans and Europeans, have become the idols of modern civilization because the Western people are very sophisticated in temporary activities for the advancement of material civilization.</p>
<p>A sane man, however, can see that all such grand activities, although perhaps very important for temporary life, have nothing to do with eternal life.</p>
<p>The entire world is imitating the materialistic civilization of the West, and therefore the Krsna consciousness movement is very much interested in giving the Western people knowledge by translating the original Sanskrit Vedic literatures into Western languages.</p>
<p>The word vivikta-padam refers to the path of logical discourses concerning the aim of life.</p>
<p>If one does not discuss that which is important in life, one is put into darkness and must struggle for existence.</p>
<p>What, then, is the benefit of his advancement in knowledge? The people of the West are seeing their students becoming hippies, despite gorgeous arrangements for university education.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement, however, is trying to convert misguided, drug-addicted students to the service of Krsna and engage them in the best welfare activities for human society.</p>

<p>This verse explains the words ksaura-pavyam svayam bhrami, which especially refer to the orbit of eternal time.</p>

<p>na cen nirarthakam nitih</p>
<p>ka ca hanis tato ’dhika</p>
<p>Even a moment of one’s lifetime could not be returned in exchange for millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Therefore one should consider how much loss one suffers if he wastes even a moment of his life for nothing.</p>
<p>Living like an animal, not understanding the goal of life, one foolishly thinks that there is no eternity and that his life span of fifty, sixty, or, at the most, one hundred years, is everything.</p>
<p>This is the greatest foolishness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>(Narada Muni had asked how one could ignorantly defy one’s own father.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas understood the meaning of this question.) One must accept the original instructions of the sastra.</p>
<p>According to Vedic civilization, one is offered a sacred thread as a sign of second birth.</p>
<p>One takes his second birth by dint of having received instructions in the sastra from a bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Therefore, sastra, scripture, is the real father.</p>
<p>All the sastras instruct that one should end his material way of life.</p>
<p>If one does not know the purpose of the father’s orders, the sastras, he is ignorant.</p>
<p>The words of a material father who endeavors to engage his son in material activities are not the real instructions of the father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita (16.7) says, pravrttim ca nivrttim ca jana na vidur asurah: demons, who are less than human beings but are not called animals, do not know the meaning of pravrtti and nivrtti, work to be done and work not to be done.</p>
<p>In the material world, every living entity has a desire to lord it over the material world as much as possible.</p>
<p>This is called pravrtti-marga.</p>
<p>All the sastras, however, advise nivrtti-marga, or release from the materialistic way of life.</p>
<p>Apart from the sastras of the Vedic civilization, which is the oldest of the world, other sastras agree on this point.</p>
<p>For example, in the Buddhist sastras Lord Buddha advises that one achieve nirvana by giving up the materialistic way of life.</p>
<p>In the Bible, which is also sastra, one will find the same advice: one should cease materialistic life and return to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In any sastra one may examine, especially the Vedic sastra, the same advice is given: one should give up his materialistic life and return to his original, spiritual life.</p>
<p>Sankaracarya also propounds the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Brahma satyam jagan mithya: this material world or materialistic life is simply illusion, and therefore one should stop his illusory activities and come to the platform of Brahman.</p>
<p>The word sastra refers to the scriptures, particularly the Vedic books of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Vedas—Sama, Yajur, Rg and Atharva—and any other books deriving knowledge from these Vedas are considered Vedic literatures.Bhagavad-gita is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, and therefore it is the scripture whose instructions should be especially accepted.</p>
<p>In this essence of all sastras, Krsna personally advises that one give up all other duties and surrender unto Him (sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja (Bg.18.66)).</p>
<p>One should be initiated into following the principles of sastra.</p>
<p>In offering initiation, our Krsna consciousness movement asks one to come to the conclusion of sastra by taking the advice of the supreme speaker of the sastra, Krsna, forgetting the principles of the materialistic way of life.</p>
<p>Therefore the principles we advise are no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating.</p>
<p>These four types of engagement will enable an intelligent person to get free from the materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>In regard to the instructions of the father and mother, it may be said that every living entity, including even the insignificant cats, dogs and serpents, takes birth of a father and mother.</p>
<p>Therefore, getting a material father and mother is not a problem.</p>
<p>In every form of life, birth after birth, the living entity gets a father and mother.</p>
<p>In human society, however, if one is satisfied with his material father and mother and their instructions and does not make further progress by accepting a spiritual master and being educated in the sastras, he certainly remains in darkness.</p>
<p>The material father and mother are important only if they are interested in educating their son to become free from the clutches of death.</p>
<p>As instructed by Rsabhadeva (Bhag.5.5.18): pita na sa syaj janani na sa syat/ na mocayed yah samupeta-mrtyum.</p>
<p>One should not strive to become a mother or father if one cannot save one’s dependent son from the impending danger of death.</p>
<p>A parent who does not know how to save his son has no value because such fathers and mothers may be had in any form of life, even among the cats, dogs and so on.</p>
<p>Only a father and mother who can elevate their son to the spiritual platform are bona fide parents.</p>
<p>Therefore according to the Vedic system it is said, janmana jayate sudrah: one is born of a material father and mother as a sudra.</p>
<p>The purpose of life, however, is to become a brahmana, a first-class man.</p>
<p>A first-class intelligent man is called a brahmana because he knows the Supreme Brahman, the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic instructions, tad-vijnanartham sa gurum evabhigacchet: (MU1.2.12) to know this science, one must approach a bona fide guru, a spiritual master who will initiate the disciple with the sacred thread so that he may understand the Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>Janmana jayate sudrah samskarad dhi bhaved dvijah.</p>
<p>Becoming a brahmana through the endeavor of a bona fide spiritual master is called samskara.</p>
<p>After initiation, one is engaged in study of the sastra, which teaches the student how to gain release from materialistic life and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is teaching this higher knowledge of retiring from materialistic life to return to Godhead, but unfortunately many parents are not very satisfied with this movement.</p>
<p>Aside from the parents of our students, many businessmen are also dissatisfied because we teach our students to abandon intoxication, meat-eating, illicit sex and gambling.</p>
<p>If the Krsna consciousness movement spreads, the so-called businessmen will have to close their slaughterhouses, breweries and cigarette factories.</p>
<p>Therefore they are also very much afraid.</p>
<p>However, we have no alternative than to teach our disciples to free themselves from materialistic life.</p>
<p>We must instruct them in the opposite of material life to save them from the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>Narada Muni, therefore, advised the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, that instead of begetting progeny, it would be better to leave and achieve the perfection of spiritual understanding according to the instructions of the sastras.</p>
<p>The importance of the sastras is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (16.23):</p>
<p>yah sastra-vidhim utsrjya</p>
<p>vartate kama-karatah</p>
<p>na sa siddhim avapnoti</p>
<p>na sukham na param gatim</p>
<p>One who disregards the injunctions of the sastras and acts whimsically, as he likes, never achieves the perfection of life, not to speak of happiness.</p>
<p>Nor does he return home to the spiritual world</p>

<p>Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after hearing the instructions of Narada, the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were firmly convinced.</p>
<p>They all believed in his instructions and reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Having accepted him as their spiritual master, they circumambulated that great sage and followed the path by which one never returns to this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From this verse we can understand the meaning of initiation and the duties of a disciple and spiritual master.</p>
<p>The spiritual master never instructs his disciple, Take a mantra from me, pay me some money, and by practicing this yoga system you will become very expert in materialistic life This is not the duty of a spiritual master.</p>
<p>Rather, the spiritual master teaches the disciple how to give up materialistic life, and the disciple’s duty is to assimilate his instructions and ultimately follow the path back home, back to Godhead, from whence no one returns to this material world.</p>
<p>After hearing the instructions of Narada Muni, the Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, decided not to be entangled in materialistic life by begetting hundreds of children and having to take care of them.</p>
<p>This would have been unnecessarily entangling.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas did not consider pious and impious activities.</p>
<p>Their materialistic father had instructed them to increase the population, but because of the words of Narada Muni, they could not heed that instruction.</p>
<p>Narada Muni, as their spiritual master, gave them the sastric instructions that they should give up this material world, and as bona fide disciples they followed his instructions.</p>
<p>One should not endeavor to wander to different planetary systems within this universe, for even if one goes to the topmost planetary system, Brahmaloka, one must return again (ksine punye martya-lokam visanti (Bg.9.21)).</p>
<p>The endeavors of karmis are a useless waste of time.</p>
<p>One should endeavor to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the perfection of life.</p>

<p>The seven musical notes—sa, r, ga, ma, pa, dha and ni—are used in musical instruments, but originally they come from the Sama Veda.</p>
<p>The great sage Narada vibrates sounds describing the pastimes of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>By such transcendental vibrations, such as Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, he fixes his mind at the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus he directly perceives Hrsikesa, the master of the senses.</p>
<p>After delivering the Haryasvas, Narada Muni continued traveling throughout the planetary systems, his mind always fixed at the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The goodness of the great sage Narada Muni is described herewith.</p>
<p>He always chants about the pastimes of the Lord and delivers the fallen souls back to Godhead.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has sung:</p>
<p>‘radhika-ramana’-name</p>
<p>bhakata-gita-same</p>
<p>sravana-yugale giya</p>
<p>bhariya apana hiya</p>
<p>mataya jagata-jane</p>
<p>keha mate mane mane</p>
<p>premera saghana rola</p>
<p>’bola bola hari bola’</p>
<p>’hari hari’ bali’ gaya</p>
<p>nama-rasa sabe paya</p>
<p>pura’la amara asa</p>
<p>bhakativinoda dasa</p>
<p>The purport of this song is that Narada Muni, the great soul, plays a stringed instrument called a vina, vibrating the sound radhika-ramana, which is another name for Krsna.</p>
<p>As soon as he strokes the strings, all the devotees begin responding, making a very beautiful vibration.</p>
<p>Accompanied by the stringed instrument, the singing seems like a shower of nectar, and all the devotees dance in ecstasy to the fullest extent of their satisfaction.</p>
<p>While dancing, they appear madly intoxicated with ecstasy, as if drinking the beverage called madhuri-pura.</p>
<p>Some of them cry, some of them dance, and some of them, although unable to dance publicly, dance within their hearts.</p>
<p>Lord Siva embraces Narada Muni and begins talking in an ecstatic voice, and seeing Lord Siva dancing with Narada, Lord Brahma also joins, saying, All of you kindly chant ‘Hari bol! Hari bol!’ The King of heaven, Indra, also gradually joins with great satisfaction and begins dancing and chanting Hari bol! Hari bol In this way, by the influence of the transcendental vibration of the holy name of God, the whole universe becomes ecstatic.</p>
<p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, When the universe becomes ecstatic, my desire is satisfied.</p>
<p>I therefore pray unto the lotus feet of Rupa Gosvami that this chanting of harer nama (Adi 17.21) may go on nicely like this Lord Brahma is the guru of Narada Muni, who is the guru of Vyasadeva, and Vyasadeva is the guru of Madhvacarya.</p>
<p>Thus the Gaudiya-Madhva-sampradaya is in the disciplic succession from Narada Muni.</p>
<p>The members of this disciplic succession—in other words, the members of the Krsna consciousness movement—should follow in the footsteps of Narada Muni by chanting the transcendental vibration Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>They should go everywhere to deliver the fallen souls by vibrating the Hare Krsna mantra and the instructions of Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam and Caitanya-caritamrta.</p>
<p>That will please the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One can spiritually advance if one actually follows the instructions of Narada Muni.</p>
<p>If one pleases Narada Muni, then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Hrsikesa, is also pleased (yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasadah ).</p>
<p>The immediate spiritual master is the representative of Narada Muni; there is no difference between the instructions of Narada Muni and those of the present spiritual master.</p>
<p>Both Narada Muni and the present spiritual master speak the same teachings of Krsna, who says in Bhagavad-gita (18.65–66):</p>
<p>man-mana bhava mad-bhakto</p>
<p>mad-yaji mam namaskuru</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>nasam—the loss; nisamya—hearing of; putranam—of his sons; naradat—from Narada; sila-salinam—who were the best of well-behaved persons; anvatapyata—suffered; kah—Prajapati Daksa; socan—lamenting; su-prajastvam—having ten thousand well-behaved sons; sucam—of lamentation; padam—position.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were very well behaved, cultured sons, but unfortunately, because of the instructions of Narada Muni, they deviated from the order of their father.</p>
<p>When Daksa heard this news, which was brought to him by Narada Muni, he began to lament.</p>
<p>Although he was the father of such good sons, he had lost them all.</p>
<p>Certainly this was lamentable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Haryasvas, the sons of Prajapati Daksa, were certainly well behaved, learned and advanced, and in accordance with the order of their father they went to perform austerities to beget good sons for their family.</p>
<p>But Narada Muni took advantage of their good behavior and culture to properly direct them not to be involved with this material world, but to use their culture and knowledge to end their material affairs.</p>
<p>The Haryasvas abided by the order of Narada Muni, but when news of this was brought to Prajapati Daksa, the prajapati, instead of being happy with the actions of Narada Muni, was extremely sorrowful.</p>
<p>Similarly, we are trying to bring as many young men as possible to the Krsna consciousness movement for their ultimate benefit, but the parents of the young men joining this movement, being very sorry, are lamenting and making counterpropaganda.</p>
<p>Of course, Prajapati Daksa did not make propaganda against Narada Muni, but later, as we shall see, Daksa cursed Narada Muni for his benevolent activities.</p>
<p>This is the way of materialistic life.</p>
<p>A materialistic father and mother want to engage their sons in begetting children, striving for improved economic conditions and rotting in materialistic life.</p>
<p>They are not unhappy when their children become spoiled, useless citizens, but they lament when they join the Krsna consciousness movement to achieve the ultimate goal of life.</p>
<p>This animosity between parents and the Krsna consciousness movement has existed since time immemorial.</p>
<p>Even Narada Muni was condemned, not to speak of others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Narada Muni never gives up his mission.</p>
<p>To deliver as many fallen souls as possible, he continues playing his musical instrument and vibrating the transcendental sound Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When Prajapati Daksa was lamenting for his lost children, Lord Brahma pacified him with instructions, and thereafter Daksa begot one thousand more children in the womb of his wife, Pancajani.</p>
<p>This time his sons were known as the Savalasvas.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa was so named because he was very expert in begetting children (The word daksa means expert) First he begot ten thousand children in the womb of his wife, and when the children were lost—when they returned home, back to Godhead—he begot another set of children, known as the Savalasvas.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa is very expert in begetting children, and Narada Muni is very expert in delivering all the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the materialistic experts do not agree with the spiritual expert Narada Muni but this does not mean that Narada Muni will give up his engagement of chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>

<p>In accordance with their father’s order to beget children, the second group of sons also went to Narayana-saras, the same place where their brothers had previously attained perfection by following the instructions of Narada.</p>
<p>Undertaking great vows of austerity, the Savalasvas remained at that holy place.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa sent his second group of sons to the same place where his previous sons had attained perfection.</p>
<p>He did not hesitate to send his second group of sons to the same place, although they too might become victims of Narada’s instructions.</p>
<p>According to the Vedic culture, one should be trained in spiritual understanding as a brahmacari before entering household life to beget children.</p>
<p>This is the Vedic system.</p>
<p>Thus Prajapati Daksa sent his second group of sons for cultural improvement, despite the risk that because of the instructions of Narada they might become as intelligent as their older brothers.</p>
<p>As a dutiful father, he did not hesitate to allow his sons to receive cultural instructions concerning the perfection of life; he depended upon them to choose whether to return home, back to Godhead, or to rot in this material world in various species of life.</p>
<p>In all circumstances, the duty of the father is to give cultural education to his sons, who must later decide which way to go.</p>
<p>Responsible fathers should not hinder their sons who are making cultural advancement in association with the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>This is not a father’s duty.</p>
<p>The duty of a father is to give his son complete freedom to make his choice after becoming spiritually advanced by following the instructions of the spiritual master.</p>

<p>At Narayana-saras, the second group of sons performed penances in the same way as the first.</p>
<p>They bathed in the holy water, and by its touch all the dirty material desires in their hearts were cleansed away.</p>
<p>They murmured mantras beginning with omkara and underwent a severe course of austerities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>

<p>Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (7.8), pranavah sarva-vedesu: In all the Vedic mantras, I am represented by pranava, or omkara Thus chanting of the Vedic mantras beginning with omkara is directly chanting of Krsna’s name.</p>
<p>There is no difference.</p>
<p>Whether one chants omkara or addresses the Lord as Krsna the meaning is the same, but Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended that in this age one chant the Hare Krsna mantra (harer nama eva kevalam (Adi 17.21)).</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For a few months the sons of Prajapati Daksa drank only water and ate only air.</p>
<p>Thus undergoing great austerities, they recited this mantra: Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Narayana, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is always situated in His transcendental abode.</p>
<p>Since He is the Supreme Person (paramahamsa), let us offer our respectful obeisances unto Him</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From these verses it is apparent that the chanting of the maha-mantra or the Vedic mantras must be accompanied by severe austerities.</p>
<p>In Kali-yuga, people cannot undergo severe austerities like those mentioned herein—drinking only water and eating only air for many months.</p>
<p>One cannot imitate such a process.</p>
<p>But at least one must undergo some austerity by giving up four unwanted principles, namely illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling.</p>
<p>Anyone can easily practice this tapasya, and then the chanting of the Hare Krsna mantra will be effective without delay.</p>
<p>One should not give up the process of austerity.</p>
<p>If possible, one should bathe in the waters of the Ganges or Yamuna, or in the absence of the Ganges and Yamuna one may bathe in the water of the sea.</p>
<p>This is an item of austerity.</p>
<p>Our Krsna consciousness movement has therefore established two very large centers, one in Vrndavana and another in Mayapur, Navadvipa.</p>
<p>There one may bathe in the Ganges or Yamuna, chant the Hare Krsna mantra and thus become perfect and return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>Narada Muni encouraged Prajapati Daksa’s second group of sons by awakening their natural affinity for their brothers.</p>
<p>He urged them to follow their older brothers if they were at all affectionate toward them.</p>
<p>Family affection is very strong, and therefore Narada Muni followed this tactic of reminding them of their family relationship with the Haryasvas.</p>
<p>Generally the word nigama refers to the Vedas, but here nigama refers to the instructions contained in the Vedas.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam says, nigama-kalpa-taror galitam phalam: (SB 1.1.3) the Vedic instructions are like a tree, of which Srimad-Bhagavatam is the ripened fruit.</p>
<p>Narada Muni is engaged in distributing this fruit, and therefore he instructed Vyasadeva to write this Maha-Purana, Srimad-Bhagavatam, for the benefit of ignorant human society anarthopasamam saksad</p>
<p>bhakti-yogam adhoksaje</p>
<p>lokasyajanato vidvams</p>
<p>cakre satvata-samhitam</p>
<p>The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service.</p>
<p>But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyasadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth (Bhag.1.7.6) People are suffering because of ignorance and are following a wrong path for happiness.</p>
<p>This is called anartha.</p>
<p>These material activities will never make them happy, and therefore Narada instructed Vyasadeva to record the instructions of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Vyasadeva actually followed Narada and did this.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam is the supreme instruction of the Vedas.</p>

<p>When Daksa met Narada, Daksa’s lips began trembling in anger, and he spoke as follows.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that Narada Muni had delivered the entire family of Svayambhuva Manu, beginning with Priyavrata and Uttanapada.</p>
<p>He had delivered Uttanapada’s son Dhruva and had even delivered Pracinabarhi, who was engaged in fruitive activities.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa said: Alas, Narada Muni, you wear the dress of a saintly person, but you are not actually a saint.</p>
<p>Indeed, although I am now in grhastha life, I am a saintly person.</p>
<p>By showing my sons the path of renunciation, you have done me an abominable injustice.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, sannyasira alpa chidra sarva-loke gaya (Cc.Madhya 12.51).</p>
<p>In society one will find many sannyasis, vanaprasthas, grhasthas and brahmacaris, but if all of them properly live in accordance with their duties, they are understood to be sadhus.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa was certainly a sadhu because he had executed such great austerities that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, had appeared before him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he had a fault-finding mentality.</p>
<p>He improperly thought Narada Muni to be asadhu, or nonsaintly, because Narada had foiled his intentions.</p>
<p>Desiring to train his sons to become grhasthas fully equipped with knowledge, Daksa had sent them to execute austerities by Narayana-saras.</p>
<p>Narada Muni, however, taking advantage of their highly elevated position in austerity, instructed them to become Vaisnavas in the renounced order.</p>
<p>This is the duty of Narada Muni and his followers.</p>
<p>They must show everyone the path of renouncing this material world and returning home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa, however, could not see the exaltedness of the duties Narada Muni performed in relation to his sons.</p>
<p>Unable to appreciate Narada Muni’s behavior, Daksa accused Narada of being asadhu.</p>
<p>The words bhiksor marga, the path of the renounced order are very significant in this regard.</p>
<p>A sannyasi is called tridandi-bhiksu because his duty is to beg alms from the homes of grhasthas and to give the grhasthas spiritual instructions.</p>
<p>A sannyasi is allowed to beg from door to door, but a grhastha cannot do so.</p>
<p>Grhasthas may earn their living according to the four divisions of spiritual life.</p>
<p>A brahmana grhastha may earn his livelihood by becoming a learned scholar and teaching people in general how to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He may also assume the duty of worship himself.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said that only brahmanas may engage in Deity worship, and they may accept as prasada whatever people offer the Deity.</p>
<p>Although a brahmana may sometimes accept charity, it is not for his personal maintenance but for the worship of the Deity.</p>
<p>Thus a brahmana does not stock anything for his future use.</p>
<p>Similarly, ksatriyas may collect taxes from the citizens, and they must also protect the citizens, enforce rules and regulations, and maintain law and order.</p>
<p>Vaisyas should earn their livelihood through agriculture and cow protection, and sudras should maintain their livelihood by serving the three higher classes.</p>
<p>Unless one becomes a brahmana, one cannot take sannyasa.</p>
<p>Sannyasis and brahmacaris may beg alms door to door, but a grhastha cannot.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa condemned Narada Muni because Narada, a brahmacari who could beg from door to door, had made sannyasis of Daksa’s sons, who were being trained to be grhasthas.</p>
<p>Daksa was extremely angry at Narada because he thought that Narada had done him a great injustice.</p>
<p>According to Daksa’s opinion, Narada Muni had misled Daksa’s inexperienced sons (asadhv akary arbhakanam).</p>
<p>Daksa regarded his sons as innocent boys who had been misled when Narada showed them the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>Because of all these considerations, Prajapati Daksa charged that Narada Muni was asadhu and should not have adopted the dress of a sadhu.</p>
<p>Sometimes a saintly person is misunderstood by grhasthas, especially when he instructs their young sons to accept Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Generally a grhastha thinks that unless one enters grhastha life he cannot properly enter the renounced order.</p>
<p>If a young man immediately adopts the path of the renounced order in accordance with the instructions of Narada or a member of his disciplic succession, his parents become very angry.</p>
<p>This same phenomenon is occurring in our Krsna consciousness movement because we are instructing all the young boys in the Western countries to follow the path of renunciation.</p>
<p>We allow grhastha life, but a grhastha also follows the path of renunciation.</p>
<p>Even a grhastha has to give up so many bad habits that his parents think his life has been practically destroyed.</p>
<p>We allow no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication, and consequently the parents wonder how, if there are so many no’s, one’s life can be positive.</p>
<p>In the Western countries especially, these four prohibited activities practically constitute the life and soul of the modern population.</p>
<p>Therefore parents sometimes dislike our movement, just as Prajapati Daksa disliked the activities of Narada and accused Narada of dishonesty.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although parents may be angry at us, we must perform our duty without hesitation because we are in the disciplic succession from Narada Muni.</p>
<p>People addicted to householder life wonder how one can give up the enjoyment of grhastha life, which is a concession for sex enjoyment, simply to become a mendicant in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>They do not know that the householder’s concession for sex life cannot be regulated unless one accepts the life of a mendicant.</p>
<p>The Vedic civilization therefore enjoins that at the end of one’s fiftieth year one must give up household life.</p>
<p>This is compulsory.</p>
<p>However, because modern civilization is misled, householders want to remain in family life until death, and therefore they are suffering.</p>
<p>In such cases, the disciples of Narada Muni advise all the members of the younger generation to join the Krsna consciousness movement immediately.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong in this.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa said: My sons were not at all freed from their three debts.</p>
<p>Indeed, they did not properly consider their obligations.</p>
<p>O Narada Muni, O personality of sinful action, you have obstructed their progress toward good fortune in this world and the next because they are still indebted to the saintly persons, the demigods and their father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As soon as a brahmana takes birth, he assumes three kinds of debts—debts to great saints, debts to the demigods and debts to his father.</p>
<p>The son of a brahmana must undergo celibacy (brahmacarya) to clear his debts to the saintly persons, he must perform ritualistic ceremonies to clear his debts to the demigods, and he must beget children to become free from his debts to his father.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa argued that although the renounced order is recommended for liberation, one cannot attain liberation unless one fulfills his obligations to the demigods, the saints and his father.</p>
<p>Since Daksa’s sons had not liberated themselves from these three debts, how could Narada Muni have led them to the renounced order of life? Apparently, Prajapati Daksa did not know the final decision of the sastras.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.41):</p>
<p>devarsi-bhutapta-nrnam pitrnam</p>
<p>na kinkaro nayam rni ca rajan</p>
<p>sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam</p>
<p>gato mukundam parihrtya kartam</p>
<p>Everyone is indebted to the demigods, to living entities in general, to his family, to the pitas and so on, but if one fully surrenders to Krsna, Mukunda, who can give one liberation, even if one performs no yajnas, one is freed from all debts.</p>
<p>Even if one does not repay his debts, he is freed from all debts if he renounces the material world for the sake of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose lotus feet are the shelter of everyone.</p>
<p>This is the verdict of the sastra.</p>
<p>Therefore Narada Muni was completely right in instructing the sons of Prajapati Daksa to renounce this material world immediately and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Prajapati Daksa, the father of the Haryasvas and Savalasvas, did not understand the great service rendered by Narada Muni.</p>
<p>Daksa therefore addressed him as papa (the personality of sinful activities) and asadhu (a nonsaintly person).</p>
<p>Since Narada Muni was a great saint and Vaisnava, he tolerated all such accusations from Prajapati Daksa.</p>
<p>He merely performed his duty as a Vaisnava by delivering all the sons of Prajapati Daksa, enabling them to return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa continued: Thus committing violence against other living entities and yet claiming to be an associate of Lord Visnu, you are defaming the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>You needlessly created a mentality of renunciation in innocent boys, and therefore you are shameless and devoid of compassion.</p>
<p>How could you travel with the personal associates of the Supreme Lord ?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This mentality of Prajapati Daksa still continues even today.</p>
<p>When young boys join the Krsna consciousness movement, their fathers and so-called guardians are very angry at the propounder of the Krsna consciousness movement because they think that their sons have been unnecessarily induced to deprive themselves of the material enjoyments of eating, drinking and merrymaking.</p>
<p>Karmis, fruitive workers, think that one should fully enjoy his present life in this material world and also perform some pious activities to be promoted to higher planetary systems for further enjoyment in the next life.</p>
<p>A yogi, however, especially a bhakti-yogi, is callous to the opinions of this material world.</p>
<p>He is not interested in traveling to the higher planetary systems of the demigods to enjoy a long life in an advanced materialistic civilization.</p>
<p>As stated by Prabodhananda Sarasvati, kaivalyam narakayate tridasa-pur akasa-puspayate: for a devotee, merging into the Brahman existence is hellish, and life in the higher planetary systems of the demigods is a will-o’-the-wisp, a phantasmagoria with no real existence at all.</p>
<p>A pure devotee is not interested in yogic perfection, travel to higher planetary systems, or oneness with Brahman.</p>
<p>He is interested only in rendering service to the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Since Prajapati Daksa was a karmi, he could not appreciate the great service Narada Muni had rendered his eleven thousand sons.</p>
<p>Instead, he accused Narada Muni of being sinful and charged that because Narada Muni was associated with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord would also be defamed.</p>
<p>Thus Daksa criticized that Narada Muni was an offender to the Lord although he was known as an associate of the Lord.</p>

<p>All the devotees of the Lord but you are very kind to the conditioned souls and are eager to benefit others.</p>
<p>Although you wear the dress of a devotee, you create enmity with people who are not your enemies, or you break friendship and create enmity between friends.</p>
<p>Are you not ashamed of posing as a devotee while performing these abominable actions?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Such are the criticisms that must be borne by the servants of Narada Muni in the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>Through the Krsna consciousness movement, we are trying to train young people to become devotees and return home, back to Godhead, by following rigid regulative principles, but our service is appreciated neither in India nor abroad in the Western countries where we are endeavoring to spread this Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>In India the caste brahmanas have become enemies of the Krsna consciousness movement because we elevate foreigners, who are supposed to be mlecchas and yavanas, to the position of brahmanas.</p>
<p>We train them in austerities and penances and recognize them as brahmanas by awarding them sacred threads.</p>
<p>Thus the caste brahmanas of India are very displeased by our activities in the Western world.</p>
<p>In the West also, the parents of the young people who join this movement have also become enemies.</p>
<p>We have no business creating enemies, but the process is such that nondevotees will always be inimical toward us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as stated in the sastras, a devotee should be both tolerant and merciful.</p>
<p>Devotees engaged in preaching should be prepared to be accused by ignorant persons, and yet they must be very merciful to the fallen conditioned souls.</p>
<p>If one can execute his duty in the disciplic succession of Narada Muni, his service will surely be recognized.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.68–69):</p>
<p>ya idam paramam guhyam</p>
<p>mad-bhaktesv abhidhasyati</p>
<p>bhaktim mayi param krtva</p>
<p>mam evaisyaty asamsayah</p>
<p>na ca tasman manusyesu</p>
<p>kascin me priya-krttamah</p>
<p>bhavita na ca me tasmad</p>
<p>anyah priyataro bhuvi</p>
<p>For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.</p>
<p>There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear Let us continue preaching the message of Lord Krsna and not be afraid of enemies.</p>
<p>Our only duty is to satisfy the Lord by this preaching, which will be accepted as service by Lord Caitanya and Lord Krsna.</p>
<p>We must sincerely serve the Lord and not be deterred by so-called enemies.</p>
<p>In this verse the word sauhrda-ghnam (a breaker of friendshi) is used.</p>
<p>Because Narada Muni and the members of his disciplic succession disrupt friendships and family life, they are sometimes accused of being sauhrda-ghnam, creators of enmity between relatives.</p>
<p>Actually such devotees are friends of every living entity (suhrdam sarva-bhutanam), but they are misunderstood to be enemies.</p>
<p>Preaching can be a difficult, thankless task, but a preacher must follow the orders of the Supreme Lord and be unafraid of materialistic persons.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa continued: If you think that simply awakening the sense of renunciation will detach one from the material world, I must say that unless full knowledge is awakened, simply changing dresses as you have done cannot possibly bring detachment.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa was correct in stating that changing one’s dress cannot detach one from this material world.</p>
<p>The sannyasis of Kali-yuga who change their robes from white to saffron and then think they can do whatever they like are more abominable than materialistic grhasthas.</p>
<p>This is not recommended anywhere.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa was right in pointing out this defect, but he did not know that Narada Muni had aroused the spirit of renunciation in the Haryasvas and Savalasvas through full knowledge.</p>
<p>Such enlightened renunciation is desirable.</p>
<p>One should enter the renounced order with full knowledge (jnana-vairagya), for the perfection of life is possible for one who renounces this material world in that way.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.7):</p>
<p>vasudeve bhagavati</p>
<p>bhakti-yogah prayojitah</p>
<p>janayaty asu vairagyam</p>
<p>jnanam ca yad ahaitukam</p>
<p>By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world If one seriously engages in devotional service to Lord Vasudeva, jnana and vairagya are automatically manifest in one’s person.</p>
<p>There is no doubt of this.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa’s accusation that Narada had not actually elevated his sons to the platform of knowledge was not factual.</p>
<p>All the sons of Prajapati Daksa had first been raised to the platform of jnana and had then automatically renounced this world.</p>
<p>In summary, unless one’s knowledge is awakened, renunciation cannot take place, for without elevated knowledge one cannot give up attachment for material enjoyment.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Material enjoyment is indeed the cause of all unhappiness, but one cannot give it up unless one has personally experienced how much suffering it is.</p>
<p>Therefore one should be allowed to remain in so-called material enjoyment while simultaneously advancing in knowledge to experience the misery of this false material happiness.</p>
<p>Then, without help from others, one will find material enjoyment detestful.</p>
<p>Those whose minds are changed by others do not become as renounced as those who have personal experience.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that unless a woman becomes pregnant, she cannot understand the trouble of giving birth to a child.</p>
<p>Bandhya ki bujhibe prasava-vedana.</p>
<p>The word bandhya means a sterile woman.</p>
<p>Such a woman cannot give birth to a child.</p>
<p>How, then, can she perceive the pain of delivery? According to the philosophy of Prajapati Daksa, a woman should first become pregnant and then experience the pain of childbirth.</p>
<p>Then, if she is intelligent, she will not want to be pregnant again.</p>
<p>Actually however this is not a fact.</p>
<p>Sex enjoyment is so strong that a woman becomes pregnant and suffers at the time of childbirth but she becomes pregnant again, despite her experience.</p>
<p>According to Daksa’s philosophy one should become implicated in material enjoyment so that after experiencing the distress of such enjoyment one will automatically renounce.</p>
<p>Material nature, however is so strong that although a man suffers at every step, he will not cease his attempts to enjoy (trpyanti neha krpana-bahu-duhkha-bhajah).</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, unless one gets the association of a devotee like Narada Muni or his servant in the disciplic succession, one’s dormant spirit of renunciation cannot be awakened.</p>
<p>It is not a fact that because material enjoyment involves so many painful conditions one will automatically become detached.</p>
<p>One needs the blessings of a devotee like Narada Muni.</p>
<p>Then one can renounce his attachment for the material world.</p>
<p>The young boys and girls of the Krsna consciousness movement have given up the spirit of material enjoyment not because of practice but by the mercy of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His servants.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you have given me great displeasure by misguiding my sons, for no reason, to the path of renunciation.</p>
<p>This can be tolerated once.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa wanted to prove that he had been most tolerant in not having said anything when Narada Muni, for no reason, induced his ten thousand innocent sons to adopt the path of renunciation.</p>
<p>Sometimes householders are accused of being grhamedhis, for grhamedhis are satisfied with family life without spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Grhasthas, however, are different because although grhasthas live in householder life with their wives and children, they are eager for spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>Wanting to prove that he had been magnanimous to Narada Muni, Prajapati Daksa stressed that when Narada had misled his first sons, Daksa had taken no action; he had been kind and tolerant.</p>
<p>He was aggrieved, however, because Narada Muni had misled his sons for a second time.</p>
<p>Therefore he wanted to prove that Narada Muni, although dressed like a sadhu, was not actually a sadhu; he himself, although a householder, was a greater sadhu than Narada Muni.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Because Prajapati Daksa was a grhamedhi who wanted to remain in household life, he thought that if Narada Muni could not remain in one place, but had to travel all over the world, that would be a great punishment for him.</p>
<p>Actually, however, such a punishment is a boon for a preacher.</p>
<p>A preacher is known as parivrajakacarya—an acarya, or teacher, who always travels for the benefit of human society.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa cursed Narada Muni by saying that although he had the facility to travel all over the universe, he would never be able to stay in one place.</p>
<p>In the parampara system from Narada Muni, I have also been cursed.</p>
<p>Although I have many centers that would be suitable places of residence, I cannot stay anywhere, for I have been cursed by the parents of my young disciples.</p>
<p>Since the Krsna consciousness movement was started, I have traveled all over the world two or three times a year, and although I am provided comfortable places to stay wherever I go, I cannot stay anywhere for more than three days or a week.</p>
<p>I do not mind this curse by the parents of my disciples, but now it is necessary that I stay in one place to finish another task—this translation of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>If my young disciples, especially those who have taken sannyasa, take charge of traveling all over the world, it may be possible for me to transfer the curse of the parents to these young preachers.</p>
<p>Then I may sit down conveniently in one place for the work of translation.</p>

<p>I accept this curse He could have cursed Prajapati Daksa in return, but because he is a tolerant and merciful sadhu, he took no action.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>

<p>titiksavah karunikah</p>
<p>suhrdah sarva-dehinam</p>
<p>ajata-satravah santah</p>
<p>sadhavah sadhu-bhusanah</p>
<p>The symptoms of a sadhu are that he is tolerant, merciful and friendly to all living entities.</p>
<p>He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime Because Narada Muni is the most elevated of sadhus, devotees, to deliver Prajapati Daksa he silently tolerated the curse.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has taught this principle to all His devotees:</p>
<p>trnad api sunicena</p>
<p>taror api sahisnuna</p>
<p>amanina manadena</p>
<p>kirtaniyah sada harih</p>
<p>(Cc.adi 17.31)</p>
<p>One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and should be ready to offer all respects to others.</p>
<p>In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly Following the orders of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, one who preaches the glories of the Lord all over the world or all over the universe should be humbler than grass and more tolerant than a tree because a preacher cannot live an easygoing life.</p>
<p>Indeed, a preacher must face many impediments.</p>
<p>Not only is he sometimes cursed, but sometimes he must also suffer personal injury.</p>
<p>For example, when Nityananda Prabhu went to preach Krsna consciousness to the two roguish brothers Jagai and Madhai, they injured Him and made His head bleed, but nevertheless, He tolerantly delivered the two rogues, who became perfect Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>This is the duty of a preacher.</p>
<p>Lord Jesus Christ even tolerated crucifixion.</p>
<p>Therefore the curse against Narada was not very astonishing, and he tolerated it.</p>
<p>Now, it may be asked why Narada Muni stayed in the presence of Prajapati Daksa and tolerated all his accusations and curses.</p>
<p>Was that for Daksa’s deliverance? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says that after being insulted by Prajapati Daksa, Narada Muni should have left immediately, but he purposely stayed to hear all Daksa’s strong words so that Daksa might be relieved of his anger.</p>
<p>Prajapati Daksa was not an ordinary man; he had accumulated the results of many pious activities.</p>
<p>Therefore Narada Muni expected that after delivering his curse, Daksa, satisfied and freed from anger, would repent his misbehavior and thus get a chance to become a Vaisnava and be delivered.</p>
<p>When Jagai and Madhai offended Lord Nityananda, Lord Nityananda stood tolerantly, and therefore both brothers fell at His lotus feet and repented.</p>
<p>Consequently they later became perfect Vaisnavas.</p>

<p>As described in this chapter, Prajapati Daksa begot sixty daughters in the womb of his wife Asikni.</p>
<p>These daughters were given in charity to various persons to increase the population.</p>
<p>Since these offspring of Daksa were women, Narada Muni did not try to lead them toward the renounced order of life.</p>
<p>Thus the daughters were saved from Narada Muni.</p>
<p>Ten of the daughters were given in marriage to Dharmaraja, thirteen to Kasyapa Muni, and twenty-seven to the moon-god, Candra.</p>
<p>In this way fifty daughters were distributed, and of the other ten daughters, four were given to Kasyapa and two each to Bhuta, Angira and Krsasva.</p>
<p>One should know that it is because of the union of these sixty daughters with various exalted personalities that the entire universe was filled with various kinds of living entities, such as human beings, demigods, demons, beasts, birds and serpents.</p>

<p>All the daughters were very affectionate toward their father.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After the incidents concerning the loss of his many sons, Daksa repented his misunderstanding with Narada Muni.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma then saw Daksa and instructed him to beget children again.</p>
<p>This time Daksa was very cautious to beget female children instead of male children so that Narada Muni would not disturb them by urging them to accept the renounced order.</p>
<p>Females are not meant for the renounced order of life; they should be faithful to their good husbands, for if a husband is competent for liberation, his wife will also achieve liberation with him.</p>
<p>As stated in the sastra, the results of a husband’s pious activities are shared by his wife.</p>
<p>Therefore a woman’s duty is to be very chaste and faithful to her husband.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-6" id="summary-6">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#67" id="67">6.7</a></h3>
<p>As related in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, committed an offense at the feet of his spiritual master, Brhaspati.</p>
<p>Brhaspati therefore left the demigods, who then had no priest.</p>
<p>However, at the request of the demigods, Visvarupa, the son of the brahmana Tvasta, became their priest.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Indra, the King of the demigods, was sitting with his wife Sacidevi and being praised by various demigods like the Siddhas, Caranas and Gandharvas when Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods, entered the assembly.</p>
<p>Indra, being too absorbed in material opulence, forgot himself and did not respect Brhaspati, who thus became aware of Indra’s pride in his material opulence and immediately disappeared from the assembly to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>Indra became most repentant, understanding that because of his opulence he had forgotten to respect his spiritual master.</p>
<p>He left the palace to beg pardon from his spiritual master, but could not find Brhaspati anywhere.</p>
<p>Because of his disrespectful behavior toward his spiritual master.</p>
<p>Indra lost all his opulence and was conquered by the demons, who defeated the demigods in a great fight and occupied Indra’s throne.</p>
<p>King Indra, along with the other demigods, later took shelter of Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>Understanding the situation, Lord Brahma chastised the demigods for their offense to their spiritual master.</p>
<p>Following Lord Brahma’s orders, the demigods accepted Visvarupa, who was a brahmana and the son of Tvasta, as their priest.</p>
<p>Then they performed yajnas under the priesthood of Visvarupa and were able to conquer the demons.</p>

<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: O King, once upon a time, the King of heaven, Indra, being extremely proud because of his great opulence of the three worlds, transgressed the law of Vedic etiquette.</p>
<p>Seated on his throne, he was surrounded by the Maruts, Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Rbhus, Visvadevas, Sadhyas, Asvini-kumaras, Siddhas, Caranas and Gandharvas and by great saintly persons.</p>
<p>Also surrounding him were the Vidyadharas, Apsaras, Kinnaras, Patagas (birds) and Uragas (snakes).</p>
<p>All of them were offering Indra their respects and services, and the Apsaras and Gandharvas were dancing and singing with very sweet musical instruments.</p>
<p>Over Indra’s head was a white umbrella as effulgent as the full moon.</p>
<p>Fanned by yak-tail whisks and served with all the paraphernalia of a great king, Indra was sitting with his wife, Sacidevi, who occupied half the throne, when the great sage Brhaspati appeared in that assembly.</p>
<p>Brhaspati, the best of the sages, was the spiritual master of Indra and the demigods and was respected by the demigods and demons alike.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, although Indra saw his spiritual master before him, he did not rise from his own seat or offer a seat to his spiritual master, nor did Indra offer him a respectful welcome.</p>
<p>Indra did nothing to show him respect.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, who in this world would accept such riches at the risk of falling down ? Alas! I condemn my wealth and opulence.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu prayed to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, na dhanam na janam na sundarim kavitam va jagad-isa kamaye: O my Lord, I do not aspire for material opulence or wealth, nor do I want a great number of followers to accept me as their leader, nor do I want a very beautiful wife to please me Mama janmani janmanisvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaituki tvayi: I do not even want liberation.</p>
<p>All I want, life after life, is to be a faithful servant of Your Lordship According to the laws of nature, when one is extremely opulent one becomes degraded, and this is true both individually and collectively.</p>
<p>The demigods are situated in the mode of goodness, but sometimes even one who is situated in such an exalted position as King Indra, the king of all the demigods, falls down because of material opulence.</p>
<p>We are now actually seeing this in America.</p>
<p>The entire American nation has tried to advance in material opulence without striving to produce ideal human beings.</p>
<p>The result is that Americans are now regretting the wholesale criminality of American society and are wondering how America has become so lawless and unmanageable.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (7.5.31), na te viduh svartha-gatim hi visnum: persons who are unenlightened do not know the aim of life, which is to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore, both individually and collectively, they try to enjoy so-called material comforts, and they become addicted to wine and women.</p>
<p>The men produced in such a society are less than fourth class.</p>
<p>They are the unwanted population known as varna-sankara, and as stated in Bhagavad-gita, an increase of varna-sankara population creates a hellish society.</p>
<p>This is the society in which Americans now find themselves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, the Hare Krsna movement has come to America, and many fortunate young men are giving serious attention to this movement, which is creating ideal men of first-class character, men who completely refrain from meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling.</p>
<p>If the American people are serious about curbing the degraded criminal life of their nation, they must take to the Krsna consciousness movement and try to create the kind of human society advised in Bhagavad-gita (catur-varnyam maya srstam guna-karma-vibhagasah (Bg.4.13)).</p>
<p>They must divide their society into first-class men, second-class men, third-class men and fourth-class men.</p>
<p>Since they are now creating only men who are less than fourth class, how can they avoid the dangers of a criminal society? Long, long ago, Lord Indra regretted his disrespect to his spiritual master, Brhaspati.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is advised that the American people regret their mistaken advancement in civilization.</p>
<p>They should take advice from the spiritual master, the representative of Krsna.</p>
<p>If they do so, they will be happy, and theirs will be an ideal nation to lead the entire world.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>yah—anyone who; paramesthyam—royal; dhisanam—throne; adhitisthan—sitting on; na—not; kancana—anyone; pratyuttisthet—should rise before; iti—thus; bruyuh—those who say; dharmam—the codes of religion; te—they; na—not; param—higher; viduh—know.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If a person says, One who is situated on the exalted throne of a king should not stand up to show respect to another king or a brahmana it is to be understood that he does not know the superior religious principles.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this regard that when a president or king is sitting on his throne, he does not need to show respect to everyone who comes within his assembly, but he must show respect to superiors like his spiritual master, brahmanas and Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>There are many examples of how he should act.</p>
<p>When Lord Krsna was sitting on His throne and Narada fortunately entered His assembly, even Lord Krsna immediately stood up with His officers and ministers to offer respectful obeisances to Narada.</p>
<p>Narada knew that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Krsna knew that Narada was His devotee, but although Krsna is the Supreme Lord and Narada is the Lord’s devotee, the Lord observed the religious etiquette.</p>
<p>Since Narada was a brahmacari, a brahmana and an exalted devotee, even Krsna, while acting as a king, offered His respectful obeisances unto Narada.</p>
<p>Such is the conduct visible in the Vedic civilization.</p>
<p>A civilization in which the people do not know how the representative of Narada and Krsna should be respected, how society should be formed and how one should advance in Krsna consciousness—a society concerned only with manufacturing new cars and new skyscrapers every year and then breaking them to pieces and making new ones—may be technologically advanced, but it is not a human civilization.</p>
<p>A human civilization is advanced when its people follow the catur-varnya system, the system of four orders of life.</p>
<p>There must be ideal, first-class men to act as advisors, second-class men to act as administrators, third-class men to produce food and protect cows, and fourth-class men who obey the three higher classes of society.</p>
<p>One who does not follow the standard system of society should be considered a fifth-class man.</p>
<p>A society without Vedic laws and regulations will not be very helpful to humanity.</p>
<p>As stated in this verse, dharmam te na param viduh: such a society does not know the aim of life and the highest principle of religion.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Leaders who have fallen into ignorance and who mislead people by directing them to the path of destruction (as described in the previous verse) are, in effect, boarding a stone boat, and so too are those who blindly follow them.</p>
<p>A stone boat would be unable to float and would sink in the water with its passengers.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who mislead people go to hell, and their followers go with them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Vedic literature (Bhag.11.20.17):</p>
<p>nr-deham adyam sulabham sudurlabham</p>
<p>plavam sukalpam guru-karna-dharam</p>
<p>We, the conditioned souls, have fallen in the ocean of nescience, but the human body fortunately provides us a good opportunity to cross the ocean because the human body is like a very good boat.</p>
<p>When directed by a spiritual master acting as the captain, the boat can very easily cross the ocean.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the boat is helped across by favorable winds, which are the instructions of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>If one does not take advantage of all these facilities to cross the ocean of nescience, he is certainly committing suicide.</p>
<p>One who boards a boat made of stone is doomed.</p>
<p>To be elevated to the stage of perfection, humanity must first give up false leaders who present boats of stone.</p>
<p>All of human society is in such a dangerous position that to be rescued it must abide by the standard instructions of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The cream of these instructions appears in the form of Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>One should not take shelter of any other instructions, for Bhagavad-gita gives direct instructions on how to fulfill the aim of human life.</p>
<p>Lord Sri Krsna therefore says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) Give up all other processes of religion and simply surrender to Me Even if one does not accept Lord Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His instructions are so exalted and beneficial for humanity that if one follows His instructions one will be saved.</p>
<p>Otherwise one will be cheated by unauthorized meditation and gymnastic methods of yoga.</p>
<p>Thus one will board a boat of stone which will sink and drown all its passengers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately although the American people are extremely eager to get out of materialistic chaos, they are sometimes found to patronize the makers of stone boats.</p>
<p>That will not help them.</p>
<p>They must take the proper boat offered by Krsna in the form of the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>Then they will be easily saved.</p>
<p>In this regard Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments: asmamayah plavo yesam te yatha majjantam plavam anumajjanti tatheti raja-nity-upadestrsu sva-sabhyesu kopo vyanjitah.</p>
<p>If society is guided by political diplomacy, with one nation maneuvering against another, it will certainly sink like a stone boat political maneuvering and diplomacy will not save human society.</p>
<p>People must take to Krsna consciousness to understand the aim of life, to understand God and to fulfill the human mission.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>King Indra said: Therefore with great frankness and without duplicity I shall now bow my head at the lotus feet of Brhaspati, the spiritual master of the demigods.</p>
<p>Because he is in the mode of goodness, he is fully aware of all knowledge and is the best of the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Now I shall touch his lotus feet and offer my obeisances unto him to try to satisfy him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Coming to his senses, King Indra realized that he was not a very sincere disciple of his spiritual master, Brhaspati.</p>
<p>Therefore he decided that henceforward he would be nisatha, nonduplicitous.</p>
<p>Nisathah sirsna-tac-caranam sprsan: he decided to touch his head to the feet of his spiritual master.</p>
<p>From this example, we should learn this principle enunciated by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura: yasya prasadad bhagavat-prasado</p>
<p>yasyaprasadan na gatih kuto ’pi</p>
<p>By the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of Krsna.</p>
<p>Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement A disciple should never be a hypocrite or be unfaithful to his spiritual master.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.17.27), the spiritual master is also called acarya.</p>
<p>Acaryam mam vijaniyan: the Supreme Personality of Godhead says that one should respect the spiritual master, accepting him as the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Navamanyeta karhicit: one should not disrespect the acarya at any time.</p>
<p>Na martya-buddhyasuyeta: one should never think the acarya an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Familiarity sometimes breeds contempt, but one should be very careful in one’s dealings with the acarya.</p>
<p>Agadha-dhisanam dvijam: the acarya is a perfect brahmana and has unlimited intelligence in guiding the activities of his disciple.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna advises in Bhagavad-gita (4.34):</p>
<p>tad viddhi pranipatena</p>
<p>pariprasnena sevaya</p>
<p>upadeksyanti te jnanam</p>
<p>jnaninas tattva-darsinah</p>

<p>Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth One should fully surrender unto the spiritual master and with service (sevaya) one should approach him for further spiritual enlightenment.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma said: O best of the demigods, unfortunately, because of madness resulting from your material opulence, you failed to receive Brhaspati properly when he came to your assembly.</p>
<p>Because he is aware of the Supreme Brahman and fully in control of his senses, he is the best of the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Therefore it is very astonishing that you have acted impudently toward him.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Lord Brahma recognized the brahminical qualifications of Brhaspati, who was the spiritual master of the demigods because of his awareness of the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>Brhaspati was very much in control of his senses and mind, and therefore he was a most qualified brahmana.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma chastised the demigods for not properly respecting this brahmana, who was their guru.</p>
<p>Lord Brahma wanted to impress upon the demigods that one’s guru should not be disrespected under any circumstances.</p>
<p>When Brhaspati entered the assembly of the demigods, they and their king, Indra, took him for granted.</p>
<p>Since he came every day, they thought, they did not need to show him special respect.</p>
<p>As it is said, familiarity breeds contempt.</p>
<p>Being very much displeased, Brhaspati immediately left Indra’s palace.</p>
<p>Thus all the demigods, headed by Indra, became offenders at the lotus feet of Brhaspati, and Lord Brahma, being aware of this, condemned their neglect.</p>
<p>In a song we sing every day, Narottama dasa Thakura says, caksu-dana dila yei, janme janme prabhu sei: the guru gives spiritual insight to the disciple, and therefore the guru should be considered his master, life after life.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances should the guru be disrespected, but the demigods, being puffed up by their material possessions, were disrespectful to their guru.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.17.27) advises, acaryam mam vijaniyan navamanyeta karhicit/ na martya-buddhyasuyeta: the acarya should always be offered respectful obeisances; one should never envy the acarya, considering him an ordinary human being.</p>

<p>The devas are celebrated for fighting with the asuras perpetually.</p>
<p>In such fights the asuras were always defeated, but this time the demigods were defeated.</p>
<p>Why? The reason, as stated here, was that they had offended their spiritual master.</p>
<p>Their impudent disrespect of their spiritual master was the cause of their defeat by the demons.</p>

<p>By the mercy of the spiritual master one is benedicted by the mercy of Krsna.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of their firm determination to follow the instructions of Sukracarya, his disciples, the demons, are now unconcerned about the demigods.</p>
<p>In fact, kings or others who have determined faith in the mercy of brahmanas, cows and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and who always worship these three are always strong in their position.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From the instructions of Lord Brahma it is understood that everyone should very faithfully worship the brahmanas, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the cows.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is go-brahmana-hitaya ca: He is always very kind to cows and brahmanas.</p>
<p>Therefore one who worships Govinda must satisfy Him by worshiping the brahmanas and cows.</p>
<p>If a government worships the brahmanas, the cows and Krsna, Govinda, it is never defeated anywhere; otherwise it must always be defeated and condemned everywhere.</p>
<p>At the present moment, all over the world, governments have no respect for brahmanas, cows and Govinda, and consequently there are chaotic conditions all over the world.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>acaryah—the teacher or spiritual master who instructs Vedic knowledge by his personal behavior; brahmanah—of all the Vedas; murtih—the personification; pita—the father; murtih—the personification; prajapateh—of Lord Brahma; bhrata—the brother; marut-pateh murtih—the personification of Indra; mata—the mother; saksat—directly; ksiteh—of the earth; tanuh—the body; dayayah—of mercy; bhagini—the sister; murtih—the personification; dharmasya—of religious principles; atma—the self; atithih—the guest; svayam—personally; agneh—of the fire-god; abhyagatah—the invited guest; murtih—the personification; sarva-bhutani—all living entities; ca—and; atmanah—of the Supreme Lord Visnu.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The acarya, the spiritual master who teaches all the Vedic knowledge and gives initiation by offering the sacred thread, is the personification of all the Vedas.</p>
<p>Similarly, a father personifies Lord Brahma; a brother, King Indra; a mother, the planet earth; and a sister, mercy.</p>
<p>A guest personifies religious principles, an invited guest personifies the demigod Agni, and all living entities personify Lord Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the moral instructions of Canakya Pandita, atmavat sarva-bhutesu: one should observe all living entities to be on the same level as oneself.</p>
<p>This means that no one should be neglected as inferior; because Paramatma is seated in everyone’s body, everyone should be respected as a temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This verse describes the different ways in which one should respect a guru, a father, a brother, a sister, a guest and so on.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The demigods continued: Do not fear criticism for being younger than us.</p>
<p>Such etiquette does not apply in regard to Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>Except in relationship to Vedic mantras, seniority is determined by age, but one may offer respectful obeisances even to a younger person who is advanced in chanting Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>Therefore although you are junior in relationship to us, you may become our priest without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, vrddhatvam vayasa vina: one may be senior without being advanced in age.</p>
<p>Even if one is not old, one gains seniority if he is senior in knowledge.</p>
<p>Visvarupa was junior in relationship to the demigods because he was their nephew, but the demigods wanted to accept him as their priest, and therefore he would have to accept obeisances from them.</p>
<p>The demigods explained that this should not be a cause for hesitation; he could become their priest because he was advanced in Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>Similarly.</p>
<p>Canakya Pandita advises, nicad apy uttamam jnanam: one may accept education from a member of a lower social order.</p>
<p>The brahmanas, the members of the most elevated varna, are teachers, but a person in a lower family, such as a family of ksatriyas, vaisyas or even sudras, may be accepted as a teacher if he has knowledge.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu approved of this when He expressed this opinion before Ramananda Raya (Cc.Madhya 8.128):</p>
<p>kiba vipra, kiba nyasi, sudra kene naya</p>
<p>yei krsna-tattva-vetta, sei ’guru’ haya</p>
<p>It does not matter whether one is a brahmana, sudra, grhastha or sannyasi.</p>
<p>These are all material designations.</p>
<p>A spiritually advanced person has nothing to do with such designations.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one is advanced in the science of Krsna consciousness, regardless of his position in human society, he may become a spiritual master.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Visvarupa said: O demigods, although the acceptance of priesthood is decried as causing the loss of previously acquired brahminical power, how can someone like me refuse to accept your personal request? You are all exalted commanders of the entire universe.</p>
<p>I am your disciple and must take many lessons from you.</p>
<p>Therefore I cannot refuse you.</p>
<p>I must agree for my own benefit.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The professions of a qualified brahmana are pathana, pathana, yajana, yajana, dana and pratigraha.</p>
<p>The words yajana and yajana mean that a brahmana becomes the priest of the populace for the sake of their elevation.</p>
<p>One who accepts the post of spiritual master neutralizes the sinful reactions of the yajamana, the one on whose behalf he performs yajna.</p>
<p>Thus the results of the pious acts previously performed by the priest or spiritual master are diminished.</p>
<p>Therefore priesthood is not accepted by learned brahmanas.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the greatly learned brahmana Visvarupa became the priest of the demigods because of his profound respect for them.</p>

<p>akincananam—of persons who have taken to austerities and penances to become detached from worldly possessions; hi—certainly; dhanam—the wealth; sila—the collecting of grains left in the field; unchanam—and the collecting of grains left in the wholesale marketplace; tena—by that means; iha—here; nirvartita—accomplishing; sadhu—of the exalted devotees; sat-kriyah—all the pious activities; katham—how; vigarhyam—reproachable; nu—indeed; karomi—I shall execute; adhisvarah—O great governors of the planetary systems; paurodhasam—the duty of priesthood; hrsyati—is pleased; yena—by which; durmatih—one who is less intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O exalted governors of various planets, the true brahmana, who has no material possessions, maintains himself by the profession of accepting silonchana.</p>
<p>In other words, he picks up grains left in the field and on the ground in the wholesale marketplace.</p>
<p>By this means, householder brahmanas who actually abide by the principles of austerity and penance maintain themselves and their families and perform all necessary pious activities.</p>
<p>A brahmana who desires to achieve happiness by gaining wealth through professional priesthood must certainly have a very low mind.</p>
<p>How shall I accept such priesthood?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A first-class brahmana does not accept any rewards from his disciples or yajamanas.</p>
<p>Practicing austerities and penances, he instead goes to the agricultural field and collects food grains left by the agriculturalists to be collected by brahmanas.</p>
<p>Similarly, such brahmanas go to marketplaces where grains are purchased and sold wholesale, and there they collect grains left by the merchants.</p>
<p>In this way, such exalted brahmanas maintain their bodies and families.</p>
<p>Such priests never demand anything from their disciples to live in opulence, imitating ksatriyas or vaisyas.</p>
<p>In other words, a pure brahmana voluntarily accepts a life of poverty and lives in complete dependence on the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Not very many years ago, a brahmana in Krsnanagara, near Navadvipa, was offered some help from the local Zamindar, Vraja Krsnacandra.</p>
<p>The brahmana refused to accept the help.</p>
<p>He said that since he was very happy in his householder life, taking rice given by his disciples and cooking vegetables of tamarind leaves, there was no question of taking help from the Zamindar.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that although a brahmana may receive much opulence from his disciples, he should not utilize the rewards of his priesthood for his personal benefit; he must use them for the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: O King, after making this promise to the demigods, the exalted Visvarupa, surrounded by the demigods, performed the necessary priestly activities with great enthusiasm and attention.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word samadhina is very important.</p>
<p>Samadhi means complete absorption with an undiverted mind.</p>
<p>Visvarupa, who was a most learned brahmana, not only accepted the request of the demigods, but took their request seriously and performed the activities of priesthood with an undiverted mind.</p>
<p>In other words, he accepted the priesthood not for material gain, but to profit the demigods.</p>
<p>Such is the duty of a priest.</p>
<p>The word purah means family and hita means benefit Thus the word purohita indicates that the priest is the well-wisher of the family.</p>
<p>Another meaning of the word purah is first A priest’s first duty is to see that his disciples benefit spiritually and materially by all means.</p>
<p>Then he is satisfied.</p>
<p>A priest should never be interested in performing Vedic rituals for his personal benefit.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The opulence of the demons, who are generally known as the enemies of the demigods, was protected by the talents and tactics of Sukracarya, but Visvarupa, who was most powerful, composed a protective prayer known as the Narayana-kavaca.</p>
<p>By this intelligent mantra, he took away the opulence of the demons and gave it to Mahendra, the King of heaven.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The distinction between the demigods (devas) and demons (asuras) is that the demigods are all devotees of Lord Visnu whereas the demons are devotees of demigods like Lord Siva, Goddess Kali and Goddess Durga.</p>
<p>Sometimes the demons are also devotees of Lord Brahma.</p>
<p>For example, Hiranyakasipu was a devotee of Lord Brahma, Ravana was a devotee of Lord Siva, and Mahisasura was a devotee of Goddess Durga.</p>
<p>The demigods are devotees of Lord Visnu (visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva), whereas the demons (asuras tad-viparyayah) are always against the visnu-bhaktas, or Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>To oppose the Vaisnavas, the demons become devotees of Lord Siva, Lord Brahma, Kali, Durga, and so on.</p>
<p>In the days of yore, many long years ago, there was animosity between the devas and the asuras, and the same spirit still continues, for the devotees of Lord Siva and Goddess Durga are always envious of Vaisnavas, who are devotees of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>This strain between the devotees of Lord Siva and Lord Visnu has always existed.</p>
<p>In the higher planetary systems, fights between the demons and the demigods continue for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Herein we see that Visvarupa made for the demigods a protective covering, saturated with a Visnu mantra.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Visnu mantra is called Visnu-jvara, and the Siva mantra is called Siva-jvara.</p>
<p>We find in the sastras that sometimes the Siva-jvara and Visnu-jvara are employed in the fights between the demons and the demigods.</p>
<p>The word sura-dvisam, which in this verse means of the enemies of the demigods also refers to the atheists.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam elsewhere says that Lord Buddha appeared for the purpose of bewildering the demons or atheists.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead always awards His benediction to devotees.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself confirms this in Bhagavad-gita (9.31):</p>
<p>kaunteya pratijanihi</p>
<p>na me bhaktah pranasyati</p>
<p>O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-7" id="summary-7">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#68" id="68">6.8</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, was victorious over the soldiers of the demons, and it also describes the shield of the Visnu mantra.</p>
<p>To take protection from this shield, one must first touch kusa grass and wash one’s mouth with acamana-mantras.</p>
<p>One should observe silence and then place the eight-syllable Visnu mantra on the parts of his body and place the twelve-syllable mantra on his hands.</p>
<p>The eight-syllable mantra is om namo narayanaya.</p>
<p>This mantra should be distributed all over the front and back of the body.</p>
<p>The twelve-syllable mantra, which begins with the pranava, omkara, is om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.</p>
<p>One syllable should be placed on each of the fingers and should be preceded by the pranava, omkara.</p>
<p>Thereafter, one must chant om visnave namah, which is a six-syllable mantra.</p>
<p>One must progressively place the syllables of the mantra on the heart, the head, between the two eyebrows, on the sikha and between the eyes, and then one should chant mah astraya phat and with this mantra protect himself from all directions.</p>
<p>Nadevo devam arcayet: one who has not risen to the level of a deva cannot chant this mantra.</p>
<p>According to this direction of the sastra, one must think himself qualitatively nondifferent from the Supreme.</p>
<p>After finishing this dedication, one must offer a prayer to the eight-armed Lord Visnu, who sits on the shoulders of Garudadeva.</p>
<p>One also has to think of the fish incarnation, Vamana, Kurma, Nrsimha, Varaha.</p>
<p>Parasurama, Ramacandra (the elder brother of Laksmana).</p>
<p>Nara-Narayana, Dattatreya (an empowered incarnation), Kapila, Sanat-kumara, Hayagriva, Naradadeva (the incarnation of a devotee).</p>
<p>Dhanvantari, Rsabhadeva, Yajna, Balarama, Vyasadeva, Buddhadeva and Kesava.</p>
<p>One should also think of Govinda, the master of Vrndavana and one should think of Narayana, the master of the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>One should think of Madhusudana, Tridhama, Madhava, Hrsikesa, Padmanabha, Janardana, Damodara and Visvesvara, as well as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>After offering prayers to the Lord’s personal expansions known as the svamsa and saktyavesa-avataras, one should pray to the weapons of Lord Narayana, such as the Sudarsana, gada, sankha, khadga and bow.</p>
<p>After explaining this process, Sukadeva Gosvami told Maharaja Pariksit how Visvarupa, the brother of Vrtrasura, described the glories of the Narayana-kavaca to Indra.</p>

<p>May Lord Buddhadeva protect me from activities opposed to Vedic principles and from laziness that causes one to madly forget the Vedic principles of knowledge and ritualistic action.</p>
<p>May Kalkideva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who appeared as an incarnation to protect religious principles, protect me from the dirt of the age of Kali.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse mentions various incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appear for various purposes.</p>
<p>Srila Vyasadeva, Mahamuni, compiled the Vedic literature for the benefit of all human society.</p>
<p>If one wants to be protected from the reactions of ignorance even in this age of Kali, one may consult the books left by Srila Vyasadeva, Upanisads, Vedanta-sutra (Brahma-sutra), Mahabharata, Srimad-Bhagavatam Maha-Purana (Vyasadeva’s commentary on the Brahma-sutra) and the other seventeen Puranas.</p>
<p>Only by the mercy of Srila Vyasadeva do we have so many volumes of transcendental knowledge to save us from the clutches of ignorance.</p>
<p>As described by Srila Jayadeva Gosvami in his Dasavatara-stotra, Lord Buddha apparently decried the Vedic knowledge:</p>
<p>nindasi yajna-vidher ahaha sruti-jatam</p>
<p>sadaya-hrdaya-darsita-pasu-ghatam</p>
<p>kesava dhrta-buddha-sarira jaya jagad-isa hare</p>
<p>The mission of Lord Buddha was to save people from the abominable activity of animal killing and to save the poor animals from being unnecessarily killed.</p>
<p>When pasandis were cheating by killing animals on the plea of sacrificing them in Vedic yajnas, the Lord said, If the Vedic injunctions allow animal killing, I do not accept the Vedic principles Thus he actually saved people who acted according to Vedic principles.</p>
<p>One should therefore surrender to Lord Buddha so that he can help one avoid misusing the injunctions of the Vedas.</p>
<p>The Kalki avatara is the fierce incarnation who vanquishes the class of the atheists born in this age of Kali.</p>
<p>Now, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, many irreligious principles are in effect, and as Kali-yuga advances, many pseudo religious principles will certainly be introduced, and people will forget the real religious principles enunciated by Lord Krsna before the beginning of Kali-yuga, namely principles of surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of Kali-yuga, foolish people do not surrender to the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p>Even most people who claim to belong to the Vedic system of religion are actually opposed to the Vedic principles.</p>
<p>Every day they manufacture a new type of dharma on the plea that whatever one manufactures is also a path of liberation.</p>
<p>Atheistic men generally say, yata mata tata patha.</p>
<p>According to this view, there are hundreds and thousands of different opinions in human society, and each opinion is a valid religious principle.</p>
<p>This philosophy of rascals has killed the religious principles mentioned in the Vedas, and such philosophies will become increasingly influential as Kali-yuga progresses.</p>
<p>In the last stage of Kali-yuga, Kalkideva, the fierce incarnation of Kesava, will descend to kill all the atheists and will save only the devotees of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the living entities, the material energy, the spiritual energy and the entire creation are all individual substances.</p>
<p>In the ultimate analysis, however, together they constitute the supreme one, the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge see unity in diversity.</p>
<p>For such advanced persons, the Lord’s bodily decorations, His name, His fame, His attributes and forms and the weapons in His hand are manifestations of the strength of His potency.</p>
<p>According to their elevated spiritual understanding, the omniscient Lord, who manifests various forms, is present everywhere.</p>
<p>May He always protect us everywhere from all calamities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A person highly elevated in spiritual knowledge knows that nothing exists but the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (9.4) where Lord Krsna says, maya tatam idam sarvam, indicating that everything we see is an expansion of His energy.</p>
<p>Visnu Purana (1.22.52):</p>
<p>ekadesa-sthitasyagner</p>
<p>jyotsna vistarini yatha</p>
<p>parasya brahmanah saktis</p>
<p>tathedam akhilam jagat</p>
<p>As a fire, although existing in one place, can expand its light and heat everywhere, so the omnipotent Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although situated in His spiritual abode, expands Himself everywhere, in both the material and spiritual worlds, by His various energies.</p>
<p>Since both cause and effect are the Supreme Lord, there is no difference between cause and effect.</p>
<p>Consequently the ornaments and weapons of the Lord, being expansions of His spiritual energy, are not different from Him.</p>
<p>There is no difference between the Lord and His variously presented energies.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed in the Padma Purana:</p>
<p>nama cintamanih krsnas</p>
<p>caitanya-rasa-vigrahah</p>
<p>purnah suddho nitya-mukto</p>
<p>’bhinnatvan nama-naminoh</p>
<p>The holy name of the Lord is fully identical with the Lord, not partially.</p>
<p>The word purna means complete The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient, and similarly, His name, form, qualities, paraphernalia and everything pertaining to Him are complete, pure, eternal and free from material contamination.</p>
<p>The prayer to the ornaments and carriers of the Lord is not false, for they are as good as the Lord.</p>
<p>Since the Lord is all-pervasive, He exists in everything, and everything exists in Him.</p>
<p>Therefore even worship of the Lord’s weapons or ornaments has the same potency as worship of the Lord.</p>
<p>Mayavadis refuse to accept the form of the Lord, or they say that the form of the Lord is maya, or false, but one should note very carefully that this is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Although the Lord’s original form and His impersonal expansion are one, the Lord maintains His form, qualities and abode eternally.</p>
<p>Therefore this prayer says, patu sarvaih svarupair nah sada sarvatra sama-gah: May the Lord, who is all-pervasive in His various forms, protect us everywhere The Lord is always present everywhere by His name, form, qualities, attributes and paraphernalia, and they all have equal power to protect the devotees.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya explains this as follows:</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#appearance-of-the-demon-vṛtrāsura" id="appearance-of-the-demon-vṛtrāsura">Appearance of the Demon Vṛtrāsura</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-8" id="summary-8">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#69" id="69">6.9</a></h3>
<p>As described in this chapter, Indra, the King of heaven, killed Visvarupa, and therefore Visvarupa’s father performed a yajna to kill Indra.</p>
<p>When Vrtrasura appeared from that yajna, the demigods, in fear, sought shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and glorified Him.</p>
<p>Because of affection for the demons, Visvarupa secretly supplied them the remnants of yajna.</p>
<p>When Indra learned about this, he beheaded Visvarupa, but he later regretted killing Visvarupa because Visvarupa was a brahmana.</p>
<p>Although competent to neutralize the sinful reactions for killing a brahmana, Indra did not do so.</p>
<p>Instead he accepted the reactions.</p>
<p>Later, he distributed these reactions among the land, water, trees and women in general.</p>
<p>Since the land accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, a portion of the land turned into desert.</p>
<p>The trees were also given one fourth of the sinful reactions, and therefore they drip sap, which is prohibited for drinking.</p>
<p>Because women accepted one fourth of the sinful reactions, they are untouchable during their menstrual period.</p>
<p>Since water was also infested with sinful reactions, when bubbles appear in water it cannot be used for any purpose.</p>
<p>After Visvarupa was killed, his father, Tvasta, performed a sacrifice to kill King Indra.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if mantras are chanted irregularly, they yield an opposite result.</p>
<p>This happened when Tvasta performed this yajna.</p>
<p>While performing the sacrifice to kill Indra.</p>
<p>Tvasta chanted a mantra to increase Indra’s enemies, but because he chanted the mantra wrong, the sacrifice produced an asura named Vrtrasura, of whom Indra was the enemy.</p>
<p>When Vrtrasura was generated from the sacrifice, his fierce features made the whole world afraid, and his personal effulgence diminished even the power of the demigods.</p>
<p>Finding no other means of protection, the demigods began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the enjoyer of all the results of sacrifice, who is supreme throughout the entire universe.</p>
<p>The demigods all worshiped Him because ultimately no one but Him can protect a living entity from fear and danger.</p>
<p>Seeking shelter of a demigod instead of worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead is compared to trying to cross the ocean by grasping the tail of a dog.</p>
<p>A dog can swim, but that does not mean that one can cross the ocean by grasping a dog’s tail.</p>
<p>Being pleased with the demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead advised them to approach Dadhici to beg him for the bones of his own body.</p>
<p>Dadhici would comply with the request of the demigods, and with the help of his bones Vrtrasura could be killed.</p>

<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; tasya—of him; asan—there were; visvarupasya—of Visvarupa, the priest of the demigods; siramsi—heads; trini—three; bharata—O Maharaja Pariksit; soma-pitham—used for drinking the beverage soma; sura-pitham—used for drinking wine; anna-adam—used for eating; iti—thus; susruma—I have heard by the parampara system.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Visvarupa, who was engaged as the priest of the demigods, had three heads.</p>
<p>He used one to drink the beverage soma-rasa, another to drink wine and the third to eat food.</p>
<p>O King Pariksit, thus I have heard from authorities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One cannot directly perceive the kingdom of heaven, its king and other inhabitants, or how they perform their various engagements, for no one can go to the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Although modern scientists have invented many powerful space vehicles, they cannot even go to the moon, not to speak of other planets.</p>
<p>By direct experience one cannot learn anything beyond the range of human perception.</p>
<p>One must hear from authorities.</p>
<p>Therefore Sukadeva Gosvami, a great personality, says, What I am describing to you, O King, is what I have heard from authoritative sources This is the Vedic system.</p>
<p>The Vedic knowledge is called sruti because it must be received by being heard from authorities.</p>
<p>It is beyond the realm of our false experimental knowledge.</p>

<p>He loudly chanted these mantras and offered each of the demigods his proper share.</p>

<p>Because of Visvarupa’s affection for the families of both the demigods and the demons, he appeased the Supreme Lord on behalf of both dynasties.</p>
<p>When he offered oblations in the fire on behalf of the asuras, he did so secretly without the knowledge of the demigods.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>After Visvarupa was killed, his father, Tvasta, performed ritualistic ceremonies to kill Indra.</p>
<p>He offered oblations in the sacrificial fire, saying, O enemy of Indra, flourish to kill your enemy without delay</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There was some defect in Tvasta’s chanting of the mantra because he chanted it long instead of short, and therefore the meaning changed.</p>
<p>Tvasta intended to chant the word indra-satro, meaning, O enemy of Indra In this mantra, the word indra is in the possessive case (sasthi), and the word indra-satro is called a tat-purusa compound (tatpurusa-samasa).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of chanting the mantra short, Tvasta chanted it long, and its meaning changed from the enemy of Indr to Indra, who is an enemy Consequently instead of an enemy of Indra’s, there emerged the body of Vrtrasura, of whom Indra was the enemy.</p>

<p>A dog can swim in the water, but if a dog dives in the ocean and someone wants to cross the ocean by holding the dog’s tail, he is certainly fool number one.</p>
<p>A dog cannot cross the ocean, nor can a person cross the ocean by catching a dog’s tail.</p>
<p>Similarly, one who desires to cross the ocean of nescience should not seek the shelter of any demigod or anyone else but the fearless shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>The Lord’s lotus feet are an indestructible boat, and if one takes shelter of that boat he can easily cross the ocean of nescience.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of creation, a tremendous wind caused fierce waves of inundating water.</p>
<p>The great waves made such a horrible sound that Lord Brahma almost fell from his seat on the lotus into the water of devastation, but he was saved with the help of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus we also expect the Lord to protect us from this dangerous condition.</p>

<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who created us by His external potency and by whose mercy we expand the creation of the universe, is always situated before us as the Supersoul, but we cannot see His form.</p>
<p>We are unable to see Him because all of us think that we are separate and independent gods.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is an explanation of why the conditioned soul cannot see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face.</p>
<p>Even though the Lord appears before us as Lord Krsna or Lord Ramacandra and lives in human society as a leader or king, the conditioned soul cannot understand Him.</p>
<p>Avajananti mam mudha manusim tanum asritam: (Bg.9.11) rascals (mudhas) deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, thinking Him an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>However insignificant we are, we think that we are also God, that we can create a universe or that we can create another God.</p>
<p>This is why we cannot see or understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By His inconceivable internal potency, the Supreme Personality of Godhead expands into various transcendental bodies as Vamanadeva, the incarnation of strength among the demigods; Parasurama, the incarnation among saints; Nrsimhadeva and Varaha, incarnations among animals; and Matsya and Kurma, incarnations among aquatics.</p>
<p>He accepts various transcendental bodies among all types of living entities, and among human beings He especially appears as Lord Krsna and Lord Rama.</p>
<p>By His causeless mercy, He protects the demigods, who are always harassed by the demons.</p>
<p>He is the supreme worshipable Deity of all living entities.</p>
<p>He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies.</p>
<p>Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form (virat-rupa).</p>
<p>In our fearful condition, let us take shelter of Him, for we are sure that the Supreme Lord, the Supreme Soul, will give us His protection.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, is ascertained to be the original cause of creation.</p>
<p>Sridhara Svami, in his commentary Bhavartha-dipika, replies to the idea that prakrti and purusa are the causes of the cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>As stated herein, param pradhanam purusam visvam anyam: He is the supreme cause, represented as the male and female creative energies.</p>
<p>Although different from this universe, He exists in His universal form (virat ’rupa) The word prakrti, which is used to indicate the source of generation, refers to the material energy of the Supreme Lord, and the word purusa refers to the living entities, who are the superior energy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Both the prakrti and purusa ultimately enter the Supreme Lord, as stated in Bhagavad-gita (prakrtim yanti mamikam).</p>
<p>Although prakrti and purusa superficially appear to be the causes of the material manifestation, both are emanations of different energies of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Lord is the cause of prakrti and purusa.</p>
<p>He is the original cause (sarva-karana-karanam (Bs.5.1)).</p>
<p>The Naradiya Purana says:</p>
<p>avikaro ’pi paramah</p>
<p>prakrtis tu vikarini</p>
<p>anupravisya govindah</p>
<p>prakrtis cabhidhiyate</p>
<p>Both the prakrti and purusa, which are inferior and superior energies, are emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As explained in Bhagavad-gita (gam avisya), the Lord enters the prakrti, and then the prakrti creates different manifestations.</p>
<p>The prakrti is not independent or beyond His energies.</p>
<p>Vasudeva, Lord Sri Krsna, is the original cause of everything.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (10.8):</p>
<p>aham sarvasya prabhavo</p>
<p>mattah sarvam pravartate</p>
<p>iti matva bhajante mam</p>
<p>budha bhava-samanvitah</p>
<p>I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds.</p>
<p>Everything emanates from Me.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.9.33) the Lord also says, aham evasam evagre: Only I existed before the creation This is confirmed in the Brahmanda Purana as follows:</p>
<p>smrtir avyavadhanena</p>
<p>prakrtitvam iti sthitih</p>
<p>ubhayatmaka-sutitvad</p>
<p>vasudevah parah puman</p>
<p>prakrtih purusas ceti</p>
<p>sabdair eko ’bhidhiyate</p>
<p>To generate the universe, the Lord acts indirectly as the purusa and directly as the prakrti.</p>
<p>Because both energies emanate from Lord Vasudeva, the all-pervasive Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is known as both prakrti and purusa.</p>
<p>Therefore Vasudeva is the cause of everything (sarva-karana-karanam (Bs.5.1)).</p>

Your Lordship is realized by the topmost sannyasis, who wander about the world to preach Krsna consciousness, fully absorbed in samadhi through bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>Because their minds are concentrated upon You, they can receive the conception of Your personality in their fully purified hearts.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead has numerous transcendental names pertaining to different grades of revelation to various grades of devotees and transcendentalists.</p>
<p>When He is realized in His impersonal form He is called the Supreme Brahman, when realized as the Paramatma He is called antaryami, and when He expands Himself in different forms for material creation He is called Ksirodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Karanodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>When He is realized as Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha—the Caturvyuha, who are beyond the three forms of Visnu—He is the Vaikuntha Narayana.</p>
<p>Above realization of Narayana is realization of Baladeva, and above that is realization of Krsna.</p>
<p>All these realizations are possible when one engages fully in devotional service.</p>
<p>The covered core of one’s heart is then completely open to receiving an understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms.</p>

<p>O Lord, You need no support, and although You have no material body, You do not need cooperation from us.</p>
<p>Since You are the cause of the cosmic manifestation and You supply its material ingredients without being transformed, You create, maintain and annihilate this cosmic manifestation by Yourself.</p>

<p>Consequently these transcendental activities of Yours are extremely difficult to understand.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.37) says, goloka eva nivasaty akhilatma-bhutah: the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is always situated in Goloka Vrndavana.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, although Krsna is situated in His own abode, Goloka Vrndavana, He is simultaneously all-pervading and is therefore present everywhere.</p>
<p>This is very difficult for a conditioned soul to understand but devotees can understand how Krsna, without undergoing any changes, can simultaneously be in His abode and be all-pervasive.</p>
<p>The demigods are understood to be various limbs of the Supreme Lord’s body, although the Supreme Lord has no material body and does not need anyone’s help.</p>
<p>He is spread everywhere (maya tatam idam sarvam jagad avyakta-murtina).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, He is not present everywhere in His spiritual form.</p>
<p>According to the Mayavada philosophy, the Supreme Truth, being all-pervasive, does not need a transcendental form.</p>
<p>The Mayavadis suppose that since His form is distributed everywhere, He has no form.</p>
<p>This is untrue.</p>
<p>The Lord keeps His transcendental form, and at the same time He extends everywhere, in every nook and corner of the material creation.</p>

<p>These are our inquiries.</p>
<p>The ordinary conditioned soul is subject to the material laws, and he thus receives the fruits of his actions.</p>
<p>Does Your Lordship, like an ordinary human being, exist within this material world in a body produced by the material modes? Do You enjoy or suffer the good or bad results of actions under the influence of time, past work and so forth? Or, on the contrary, are You present here only as a neutral witness who is self-sufficient, free from all material desires, and always full of spiritual potency? We certainly cannot understand Your actual position.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says that He descends to this material world for two purposes, namely paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)—to relieve the devotees and kill demons or nondevotees.</p>
<p>These two kinds of action are the same for the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>When the Lord comes to punish the demons, He bestows His favor upon them, and similarly when He delivers His devotees and gives them relief, He also bestows His favor.</p>
<p>Thus the Lord bestows His favor equally upon the conditioned souls.</p>
<p>When a conditioned soul gives relief to others he acts piously, and when he gives trouble to others he acts impiously, but the Lord is neither pious nor impious; He is always full in His spiritual potency, by which He shows equal mercy to the punishable and the protectable.</p>
<p>The Lord is apapa-viddham; He is never contaminated by the reactions of so-called sinful activities.</p>
<p>When Krsna was present on this earth, He killed many inimical nondevotees, but they all received sarupya; in other words, they returned to their original spiritual bodies.</p>
<p>One who does not know the Lord’s position says that God is unkind to him but merciful to others.</p>
<p>Actually the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.29), samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah: I am equal to everyone.</p>
<p>No one is My enemy, and no one is My friend But He also says, ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya mayi te tesu capy aham: If one becomes My devotee and fully surrenders unto Me, I give him special attention</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all contradictions can be reconciled in You.</p>
<p>O Lord, since You are the Supreme Person, the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities, the supreme controller, Your unlimited glories are inconceivable to the conditioned souls.</p>
<p>Many modern theologians argue about right and wrong without knowing what is actually right.</p>
<p>Their arguments are always false and their judgments inconclusive because they have no authorized evidence with which to gain knowledge of You.</p>
<p>Because their minds are agitated by scriptures containing false conclusions, they are unable to understand the truth concerning You.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because of polluted eagerness to arrive at the right conclusion, their theories are incapable of revealing You, who are transcendental to their material conceptions.</p>
<p>You are one without a second, and therefore in You contradictions like doing and not doing, happiness and distress, are not contradictory.</p>
<p>Your potency is so great that it can do and undo anything as You like.</p>
<p>With the help of that potency, what is impossible for You? Since there is no duality in Your constitutional position, You can do everything by the influence of Your energy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, being self-sufficient, is full of transcendental bliss (atmarama).</p>
<p>He enjoys bliss in two ways—when He appears happy and when He appears distressed.</p>
<p>Distinctions and contradictions are impossible in Him because only from Him have they emanated.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all knowledge, all potency, all strength, opulence and influence.</p>
<p>There is no limit to His powers.</p>
<p>Since He is full in all transcendental attributes, nothing abominable from the material world can exist in Him.</p>
<p>He is transcendental and spiritual, and therefore conceptions of material happiness and distress do not apply to Him.</p>
<p>We should not be astonished to find contradictions in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Actually there are no contradictions.</p>
<p>That is the meaning of His being supreme.</p>
<p>Because He is all-powerful, He is not subject to the conditioned soul’s arguments regarding His existence or nonexistence.</p>
<p>He is pleased to protect His devotees by killing their enemies.</p>
<p>He enjoys both the killing and the protecting.</p>
<p>Such freedom from duality applies not only to the Lord but also to His devotees.</p>
<p>In Vrndavana, the damsels of Vrajabhumi enjoy transcendental bliss in the company of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, and they feel the same transcendental bliss in separation when Krsna and Balarama leave Vrndavana for Mathura.</p>
<p>There is no question of material pains or pleasures for either the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His pure devotees, although they are sometimes superficially said to be distressed or happy.</p>
<p>One who is atmarama is blissful in both ways.</p>
<p>Nondevotees cannot understand the contradictions present in the Supreme Lord or His devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, bhaktya mam abhijanati: (Bg.18.55) the transcendental pastimes can be understood through devotional service; to nondevotees they are inconceivable.</p>
<p>Acintyah khalu ye bhava na tams tarkena yojayet: the Supreme Lord and His form, name, pastimes and paraphernalia are inconceivable to nondevotees, and one should not try to understand such realities simply by logical arguments.</p>
<p>They will not bring one to the right conclusion about the Absolute Truth.</p>

<p>sama-visama-matinam matam anusarasi yatha rajju-khandah sarpadi-dhiyam.</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>sama—equal or proper; visama—and unequal or mistaken; matinam—of those having intelligence; matam—conclusion; anusarasi—You follow; yatha—just as; rajju-khandah—a piece of rope; sarpa-adi—a snake, etc.; dhiyam—of those who perceive.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A rope causes fear for a bewildered person who considers it a snake, but not for a person with proper intelligence who knows it to be only a rope.</p>
<p>Similarly, You, as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart, inspire fear or fearlessness according to one’s intelligence, but in You there is no duality.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says, ye yatha mam prapadyante tams tathaiva bhajamy aham: As one surrenders unto Me, I reward him accordingly The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of everything, including all knowledge, all truth and all contradictions.</p>
<p>The example cited herein is very appropriate.</p>
<p>A rope is one truth, but some mistake it for a snake, whereas others know it to be a rope.</p>
<p>Similarly, devotees who know the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not see contradictions in Him, but nondevotees regard Him as the snakelike source of all fear.</p>
<p>For example, when Nrsimhadeva appeared, Prahlada Maharaja saw the Lord as the supreme solace, whereas his father, a demon, saw Him as the ultimate death.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.2.37), bhayam dvitiyabhinivesatah syat: fear results from being absorbed in duality.</p>
<p>When one is in knowledge of duality, one knows both fear and bliss.</p>
<p>The same Supreme Lord is a source of bliss to devotees and fear to nondevotees who have a poor fund of knowledge.</p>
<p>God is one, but people understand the Absolute Truth from different angles of vision.</p>
<p>The unintelligent see contradictions in Him, but sober devotees find no contradictions.</p>

O most beautiful person within the three worlds! Everything and everyone, including human beings and even the Daitya demons and the Danavas, is but an expansion of Your energy.</p>
<p>O supremely powerful one, You have always appeared in Your forms as the various incarnations to punish the demons as soon as they become very powerful.</p>

<p>Assuming such various forms, You have always punished the demons and Danavas.</p>
<p>We therefore pray that Your Lordship appear today as another incarnation, if You so desire, to kill the great demon Vrtrasura.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two kinds of devotees, known as sakama and akama.</p>
<p>Pure devotees are akama, whereas devotees in the upper planetary systems, such as the demigods, are called sakama because they still want to enjoy material opulence.</p>
<p>Because of their pious activities, the sakama devotees are promoted to the higher planetary systems, but at heart they still desire to lord it over the material resources.</p>
<p>The sakama devotees are sometimes disturbed by the demons and Raksasas, but the Lord is so kind that He always saves them by appearing as an incarnation.</p>
<p>The Lord’s incarnations are so powerful that Lord Vamanadeva covered the entire universe with two steps and therefore had no place for His third step.</p>
<p>The Lord is called Trivikrama because He showed His strength by delivering the entire universe with merely three steps.</p>
<p>The difference between sakama and akama devotees is that when sakama devotees, like the demigods, fall into difficulty, they approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for relief, whereas akama devotees, even in the greatest danger, never disturb the Lord for material benefits.</p>
<p>Even if an akama devotee is suffering, he thinks this is due to his past impious activities and agrees to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>He never disturbs the Lord.</p>
<p>Sakama devotees immediately pray to the Lord as soon as they are in difficulty, but they are regarded as pious because they consider themselves fully dependent on the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.14.8):</p>
<p>tat te ’nukampam susamiksamano</p>
<p>bhunjana evatma-krtam vipakam</p>
<p>hrd-vag-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te</p>
<p>jiveta yo mukti-pade sa daya-bhak</p>
<p>Even while suffering in the midst of difficulties, devotees simply offer their prayers and service more enthusiastically.</p>
<p>In this way they become firmly fixed in devotional service and eligible to return home, back to Godhead, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Sakama devotees, of course, achieve from the Lord the results they desire from their prayers, but they do not immediately become fit to return to Godhead.</p>
<p>It is to be noted herein that Lord Visnu, in His various incarnations, is always the protector of His devotees.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya says: vividham bhava-patratvat sarve visnor vibhutayah.</p>
<p>Krsna is the original Personality of Godhead (krsnas tu bhagavan svayam).</p>
<p>All the other incarnations proceed from Lord Visnu.</p>

<p>O Lord, as the small sparks of a fire cannot possibly perform the actions of the whole fire, we sparks of Your Lordship cannot inform You of the necessities of our lives.</p>
<p>You are the complete whole.</p>
<p>Therefore, of what do we need to inform You? You know everything because You are the original cause of the cosmic manifestation, the maintainer and the annihilator of the entire universal creation.</p>
<p>You always engage in Your pastimes with Your spiritual and material energies, for You are the controller of all these varied energies.</p>
<p>You exist within all living entities, within the cosmic manifestation, and also beyond them.</p>
<p>You exist internally as Parabrahman and externally as the ingredients of the material creation.</p>
<p>Therefore, although manifested in various stages, at different times and places, and in various bodies, You, the Personality of Godhead, are the original cause of all causes.</p>
<p>Indeed, You are the original element.</p>
<p>You are the witness of all activities, but because You are as great as the sky, You are never touched by any of them.</p>
<p>You are the witness of everything as Parabrahman and Paramatma.</p>
<p>O Supreme Personality of Godhead, nothing is unknown to You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Absolute Truth exists in three phases of spiritual understanding—Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan (brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate).Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of Brahman and Paramatma.</p>
<p>Brahman, the impersonal Absolute Truth, is all-pervading, and Paramatma is locally situated in everyone’s heart, but Bhagavan, who is worshipable by the devotees is the original cause of all causes.</p>
<p>A pure devotee is aware that since nothing is unknown to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He need not be informed of a devotee’s conveniences and inconveniences.</p>
<p>A pure devotee knows that there is no need to ask the Absolute Truth for any material necessities.</p>
<p>Therefore, while informing the Supreme Lord about their distress in being attacked by Vrtrasura, the demigods apologized for offering prayers for their safety.</p>
<p>A neophyte devotee, of course, approaches the Supreme Lord for relief from distress or poverty, or for speculative knowledge of the Lord.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita (7.16) mentions four kinds of pious men who begin devotional service to the Lord—one who is distressed (arta), one in need of money (artharthi), one who is inquisitive (jijnasu) and one who is searching for the Absolute Truth (jnani).</p>
<p>A pure devotee, however, knows that since the Lord is omnipresent and omniscient, there is no need to offer prayers or worship Him for one’s personal benefit.</p>
<p>A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord without demanding anything.</p>
<p>The Lord is present everywhere and knows the necessities of His devotees; consequently there is no need to disturb Him by asking Him for material benefits.</p>

<p>The demigods certainly wanted Lord Visnu to relieve their anxiety, but now they directly approach Lord Krsna, for although there is no difference between Lord Krsna and Lord Visnu, Krsna descends to this planet in His Vasudeva feature for the purpose of paritranaya sadhunam vinasaya ca duskrtam (Bg.4.8)—protecting His devotees and annihilating the miscreants.</p>
<p>Demons, or atheists, always disturb the demigods, or devotees, and therefore Krsna descends to punish the atheists and demons and fulfill the desire of His devotees.</p>
<p>Krsna, being the original cause of everything, is the Supreme Person, above even Visnu and Narayana, although there is no difference between these different forms of the Lord.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.46):</p>
<p>diparcir eva hi dasantaram abhyupetya</p>
<p>dipayate vivrta-hetu-samana-dharma</p>
<p>yas tadrg eva hi ca visnutaya vibhati</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>Krsna expands Himself as Visnu the way a bright candle kindles another.</p>
<p>Although there is no difference between the power of one candle and another, Krsna is compared to the original candle.</p>
<p>The word mrsta-yasase is significant herein because Krsna is always famous for relieving His devotee from danger.</p>
<p>A devotee who has sacrificed everything for the service of Krsna and whose only source of relief is the Lord is known as akincana.</p>
<p>As expressed in the prayers offered by Queen Kunti, the Lord is akincana-vitta, the property of such a devotee.</p>
<p>Those who are liberated from the bondage of conditioned life are elevated to the spiritual world, where they achieve five kinds of liberation—sayujya, salokya, sarupya, sarsti and samipya.</p>
<p>They personally associate with the Lord in five mellows—santa, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya and madhurya.</p>
<p>These rasas are all emanations from Krsna.</p>
<p>As described by Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, the original mellow, adi-rasa, is conjugal love.</p>
<p>Krsna is the origin of pure and spiritual conjugal love.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O beloved demigods, you have offered your prayers to Me with great knowledge, and I am certainly most pleased with you.</p>
<p>A person is liberated by such knowledge, and thus he remembers My exalted position, which is above the conditions of material life.</p>
<p>Such a devotee is fully purified by offering prayers in full knowledge.</p>
<p>This is the source of devotional service to Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Another name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Uttamasloka, which means that He is offered prayers with selected verses.</p>
<p>Bhakti means sravanam kirtanam visnoh (SB 7.5.23), chanting and hearing about Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Impersonalists cannot be purified, for they do not offer personal prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Even though they sometimes offer prayers, the prayers are not directed toward the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Impersonalists sometimes show their incomplete knowledge by addressing the Lord as being nameless.</p>
<p>They always offer prayers indirectly, saying, You are this, You are that but they do not know to whom they are praying.</p>
<p>A devotee, however, always offers personal prayers.</p>
<p>A devotee says, govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami : I offer my respectful obeisances unto Govinda, unto Krsna That is the way to offer prayers.</p>
<p>If one continues to offer such personal prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is eligible to become a pure devotee and return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O best of the intelligent demigods, although it is true that nothing is difficult for one to obtain when I am pleased with him, a pure devotee, whose mind is exclusively fixed upon Me, does not ask Me for anything but the opportunity to engage in devotional service.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When the demigods finished offering their prayers, they anxiously waited for their enemy Vrtrasura to be killed.</p>
<p>This means that the demigods are not pure devotees.</p>
<p>Although without difficulty one can get anything he desires if the Lord is pleased, the demigods aspire for material profit by pleasing the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord wanted the demigods to pray for unalloyed devotional service, but instead they prayed for an opportunity to kill their enemy.</p>
<p>This is the difference between a pure devotee and a devotee on the material platform.</p>
<p>Indirectly, the Lord regretted that the demigods did not ask for pure devotional service.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>na—not; veda—knows; krpanah—a miserly living entity; sreyah—the ultimate necessity; atmanah—of the soul; guna-vastu-drk—who is attracted by the creation of the modes of material nature; tasya—of him; tan—things created by the material energy; icchatah—desiring; yacchet—one bestows; yadi—if; sah api—he also; tatha-vidhah—of the kind (a foolish krpana who does not know his real self-interest).</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Those who think material assets to be everything or to be the ultimate goal of life are called misers (krpanas).</p>
<p>They do not know the ultimate necessity of the soul.</p>
<p>Moreover, if one awards that which is desired by such fools, he must also be considered foolish.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are two classes of men—namely the krpana and the brahmana.</p>
<p>A brahmana is one who knows Brahman, the Absolute Truth, and who thus knows his real interest.</p>
<p>A krpana, however, is one who has a material, bodily concept of life.</p>
<p>Not knowing how to utilize his human or demigod life, a krpana is attracted by things created by the material modes of nature.</p>
<p>The krpanas, who always desire material benefits, are foolish, whereas brahmanas, who always desire spiritual benefits, are intelligent.</p>
<p>If a krpana, not knowing his self-interest, foolishly asks for something material, one who awards it to him is also foolish.</p>
<p>Krsna, however, is not a foolish person; He is supremely intelligent.</p>
<p>If someone comes to Krsna asking for material benefits, Krsna does not award him the material things he desires.</p>
<p>Instead, the Lord gives him intelligence so that he will forget his material desires and become attached to the Lord’s lotus feet.</p>
<p>In such cases, although the krpana offers prayers to Lord Krsna for material things, the Lord takes away whatever material possessions the krpana has and gives him the sense to become a devotee.</p>
<p>As stated by the Lord in the Caitanya-caritamrta (Madhya22.39):</p>
<p>ami—vijna, ei murkhe ’visaya’ kene diba?</p>
<p>sva-caranamrta diya ’visaya’ bhulaiba</p>
<p>Since I am very intelligent, why should I give this fool material prosperity? Instead I shall induce him to take the nectar of the shelter of My lotus feet and make him forget illusory material enjoyment If one sincerely prays to God for material possessions in exchange for devotional service, the Lord, who is not foolish like such an unintelligent devotee, shows him special favor by taking away whatever material possessions he has and gradually giving him the intelligence to be satisfied only by rendering service to His lotus feet.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments in this regard that if a foolish child requests his mother to give him poison, the mother, being intelligent, will certainly not give him poison, even though he requests it.</p>
<p>A materialist does not know that to accept material possessions means to accept poison, or the repetition of birth and death.</p>
<p>An intelligent person, a brahmana, aspires for liberation from material bondage.</p>
<p>That is the real self-interest of a human being.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>svayam—personally; nihsreyasam—the supreme goal of life, namely the means of obtaining ecstatic love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead; vit-van—one who is accomplished in devotional service; na—not; vakti—teaches; ajnaya—unto a foolish person not conversant with the ultimate goal of life; karma—fruitive activities; hi—indeed; na—not; rati—administers; roginah—unto the patient; apathyam—something unconsumable; vanchatah—desiring; api—although; bhisak-tamah—an experienced physician.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A pure devotee who is fully accomplished in the science of devotional service will never instruct a foolish person to engage in fruitive activities for material enjoyment, not to speak of helping him in such activities.</p>
<p>Such a devotee is like an experienced physician, who never encourages a patient to eat food injurious to his health, even if the patient desires it.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is the difference between the benedictions awarded by the demigods and those awarded by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu.</p>
<p>Devotees of the demigods ask for benedictions simply for sense gratification, and therefore they have been described in Bhagavad-gita (7.20) as bereft of intelligence kamais tais tair hrta-jnanah</p>
<p>prapadyante ’nya-devatah</p>
<p>tam tam niyamam asthaya</p>
<p>prakrtya niyatah svaya</p>
<p>Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures Conditioned souls are generally bereft of intelligence because of profound desires for sense gratification.</p>
<p>They do not know what benedictions to ask.</p>
<p>Therefore nondevotees are advised in the sastras to worship various demigods to achieve material benefits.</p>
<p>For example, if one wants a beautiful wife, he is advised to worship Uma, or goddess Durga.</p>
<p>If one wants to be cured of a disease, he is advised to worship the sun-god.</p>
<p>All requests for benedictions from the demigods, however, are due to material lust.</p>
<p>The benedictions will be finished at the end of the cosmic manifestation, along with those who bestow them.</p>
<p>If one approaches Lord Visnu for benedictions, the Lord will give him a benediction that will help him return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (10.10):</p>
<p>tesam satata-yuktanam</p>
<p>bhajatam priti-purvakam</p>
<p>dadami buddhi-yogam tam</p>
<p>yena mam upayanti te</p>
<p>Lord Visnu, or Lord Krsna, instructs a devotee who constantly engages in His service how to approach Him at the end of his material body.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (4.9):</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities, does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna This is the benediction of Lord Visnu, Krsna.</p>
<p>After giving up his body, a devotee returns home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>A devotee may foolishly ask for material benedictions, but Lord Krsna does not give him such benedictions, despite the devotee’s prayers.</p>
<p>Therefore people who are very attached to material life do not generally become devotees of Krsna or Visnu.</p>
<p>Instead they become devotees of the demigods (kamais tais tair hrta jnanah prapadyante ’nya-devatah (Bg.7.20)).</p>
<p>The benedictions of the demigods, however, are condemned in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Antavat tu phalam tesam tad bhavaty alpa-medhasam: Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary A non-Vaisnava, one who is not engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is considered a fool with a small quantity of brain substance.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>That saintly Dadhyanca, who is also known as Dadhici, personally assimilated the spiritual science and then delivered it to the Asvini-kumaras.</p>
<p>It is said that Dadhyanca gave them mantras through the head of a horse.</p>
<p>Therefore the mantras are called Asvasira.</p>
<p>After obtaining the mantras of spiritual science from Dadhici, the Asvini-kumaras became jivan-mukta, liberated even in this life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The following story is narrated by many acaryas in their commentaries:</p>
<p>nisamyatharvanam daksam pravargya-brahmavidyayoh; dadhyancam samupagamya tam ucatur athasvinau; bhagavan dehi nau vidyam iti srutva sa cabravit; karmany avasthito ’dyaham pascad vaksyami gacchatam; tayor nirgatayor eva sakra agatya tam munim; uvaca bhisajor vidyam ma vadir asvinor mune; yadi mad-vakyam ullanghya bravisi sahasaiva te; siras-chindyam na sandeha ity uktva sa yayau harih; indre gate tathabhyetya nasatyav ucatur dvijam; tan-mukhad indra-gaditam srutva tav ucatuh punah; avam tava siras chittva purvam asvasya mastakam; sandhasyavas tato bruhi tena vidyam ca nau dvija; tasminn indrena sanchinne punah sandhaya mastakam; nijam te daksinam dattva gamisyavo yathagatam; etac chrutva tadovaca dadhyann atharvanas tayoh pravargyam brahma-vidyam ca sat-krto ’satya-sankitah.</p>
<p>The great saint Dadhici had perfect knowledge of how to perform fruitive activities, and he had advanced spiritual knowledge as well.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the Asvini-kumaras once approached him and begged him to instruct them in spiritual science (brahma-vidya).</p>
<p>Dadhici Muni replied, I am now engaged in arranging sacrifices for fruitive activities.</p>
<p>Come back some time later When the Asvini-kumaras left, Indra, the King of heaven, approached Dadhici and said, My dear Muni, the Asvini-kumaras are only physicians.</p>
<p>Please do not instruct them in spiritual science.</p>
<p>If you impart the spiritual science to them despite my warning, I shall punish you by cutting off your head After warning Dadhici in this way, Indra returned to heaven.</p>
<p>The Asvini-kumaras, who understood Indra’s desires, returned and begged Dadhici for brahma-vidya.</p>
<p>When the great saint Dadhici informed them of Indra’s threat, the Asvini-kumaras replied, Let us first cut off your head and replace it with the head of a horse.</p>
<p>You can instruct brahma-vidya through the horse’s head, and when Indra returns and cuts off that head, we shall reward you and restore your original head Since Dadhici had promised to impart brahma-vidya to the Asvini-kumaras, he agreed to their proposal.</p>
<p>Therefore, because Dadhici imparted brahma-vidya through the mouth of a horse, this brahma-vidya is also known as Asvasira.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A devotee of the Lord is never envious of anyone, what to speak of other devotees.</p>
<p>As revealed later, Vrtrasura was also a devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore be was not expected to be envious of the demigods.</p>
<p>Indeed, of his own accord, he would try to benefit the demigods.</p>
<p>A devotee does not hesitate to give up his own body for a better cause.</p>
<p>Canakya Pandita said, san-nimitte varam tyago vinase niyate sati.</p>
<p>After all, all one’s material possessions, including his body, will be destroyed in due course of time.</p>
<p>Therefore if the body and other possessions can be utilized for a better cause, a devotee never hesitates to give up even his own body.</p>
<p>Because Lord Visnu wanted to save the demigods, Vrtrasura, even though able to swallow the three worlds, would agree to be killed by the demigods.</p>
<p>For a devotee there is no difference between living and dying because in this life a devotee engages in devotional service, and after giving up his body, he engages in the same service in the spiritual world.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-9" id="summary-9">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#610" id="610">6.10</a></h3>
<p>As described in this chapter, after Indra obtained the body of Dadhici, a thunderbolt was prepared from Dadhici’s bones, and a fight took place between Vrtrasura and the demigods.</p>
<p>Following the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods approached Dadhici Muni and begged for his body.</p>
<p>Dadhici Muni, just to hear from the demigods about the principles of religion, jokingly refused to relinquish his body, but for higher purposes he thereafter agreed to give it up, for after death the body is usually eaten by low animals like dogs and jackals.</p>
<p>Dadhici Muni first merged his gross body made of five elements into the original stock of five elements and then engaged his soul at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Thus he gave up his gross body.</p>
<p>With the help of Visvakarma, the demigods then prepared a thunderbolt from Dadhici’s bones.</p>
<p>Armed with the thunderbolt weapon, they prepared themselves to fight and got up on the backs of elephants.</p>
<p>At the end of Satya-yuga and the beginning of Treta-yuga a great fight took place between the demigods and the asuras.</p>
<p>Unable to tolerate the effulgence of the demigods, the asuras fled the battle leaving Vrtrasura, their commander in chief, to fight for himself.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura, however, seeing the demons fleeing, instructed them in the importance of fighting and dying in the battlefield.</p>
<p>One who is victorious in battle gains material possessions, and one who dies in the battlefield attains a residence at once in the celestial heavens.</p>
<p>In either way, the fighter benefits.</p>

<p>O King Pariksit, following the Lord’s instructions, the demigods approached Dadhici, the son of Atharva.</p>
<p>He was very liberal, and when they begged him to give them his body, he at once partially agreed.</p>
<p>However, just to hear religious instructions from them, he smiled and jokingly spoke as follows.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this regard, a very exalted example was set by Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the six Gosvamis of Vrndavana.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (11.5.34):</p>
<p>tyaktva sudustyaja-surepsita-rajya-laksmim</p>
<p>dharmistha arya-vacasa yad agad aranyam</p>
<p>maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam anvadhavad</p>
<p>vande maha-purusa te caranaravindam</p>
<p>We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of the Lord upon whom one should always meditate.</p>
<p>He left His householder life, leaving aside His eternal consort, whom even the denizens of heaven adore.</p>
<p>He went into the forest to deliver the fallen souls, who are put into illusion by material energy To accept sannyasa means to commit civil suicide but sannyasa is compulsory, at least for every brahmana, every first-class human being.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu had a very young and beautiful wife and a very affectionate mother.</p>
<p>Indeed, the affectionate dealings of His family members were so pleasing that even the demigods could not expect such happiness at home.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for the deliverance of all the fallen souls of the world, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu took sannyasa and left home when He was only twenty-four years old.</p>
<p>He lived a very strict life as a sannyasi, refusing all bodily comforts.</p>
<p>Similarly, His disciples the six Gosvamis were ministers who held exalted positions in society, but they also left everything to join the movement of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>Srinivasa Acarya says:</p>
<p>tyaktva turnam asesa-mandala-pati-srenim sada tucchavat</p>
<p>bhutva dina-ganesakau karunaya kaupina-kanthasritau</p>
<p>These Gosvamis left their very comfortable lives as ministers.</p>
<p>Zamindars and learned scholars and joined Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement, just to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world (dina-ganesakau karunaya).</p>
<p>Accepting very humble lives as mendicants, wearing no more than loincloths and torn quilts (kaupina-kantha) they lived in Vrndavana and followed Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s order to excavate Vrndavana’s lost glories.</p>
<p>Similarly everyone else with a materially comfortable condition in this world should join the Krsna consciousness movement to elevate the fallen souls.</p>
<p>The words bhuta-dayaya, maya-mrgam dayitayepsitam and dina-ganesakau karunaya all convey the same sense.</p>
<p>These are very significant words for those interested in elevating human society to a proper understanding of life.</p>
<p>One should join the Krsna consciousness movement, following the examples of such great personalities as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the six Gosvamis and, before them, the great sage Dadhici.</p>
<p>Instead of wasting one’s life for temporary bodily comforts one should always be prepared to give up one’s life for better causes.</p>
<p>After all, the body will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Therefore one should sacrifice it for the glory of distributing religious principles throughout the world.</p>

<p>etavan—this much; avyayah—imperishable; dharmah—religious principle; punya-slokaih—by famous persons who are celebrated as pious; upasitah—recognized; yah—which; bhuta—of the living beings; soka—by the distress; harsabhyam—and by the happiness; atma—the mind; socati—laments; hrsyati—feels happiness.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If one is unhappy to see the distress of other living beings and happy to see their happiness, his religious principles are appreciated as imperishable by exalted persons who are considered pious and benevolent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One generally follows different types of religious principles or performs various occupational duties according to the body given to him by the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>In this verse, however, real religious principles are explained.</p>
<p>Everyone should be unhappy to see others in distress and happy to see others happy.</p>
<p>Atmavat sarva-bhutesu: one should feel the happiness and distress of others as his own.</p>
<p>It is on this basis that the Buddhist religious principle of nonviolence—ahimsah parama-dharmah—is established.</p>
<p>We feel pain when someone disturbs us, and therefore we should not inflict pain upon other living beings.</p>
<p>Lord Buddha’s mission was to stop unnecessary animal killing, and therefore he preached that the greatest religious principle is nonviolence.</p>
<p>One cannot continue killing animals and at the same time be a religious man.</p>
<p>That is the greatest hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ said, Do not kill but hypocrites nevertheless maintain thousands of slaughterhouses while posing as Christians.</p>
<p>Such hypocrisy is condemned in this verse.</p>
<p>One should be happy to see others happy, and one should be unhappy to see others unhappy.</p>
<p>This is the principle to be followed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the present moment so-called philanthropists and humanitarians advocate the happiness of humanity at the cost of the lives of poor animals.</p>
<p>That is not recommended herein.</p>
<p>This verse clearly says that one should be compassionate to all living entities.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether human animal, tree or plant, all living entities are sons of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna says in Bhagavad-gita (14.4):</p>
<p>sarva-yonisu kaunteya</p>
<p>murtayah sambhavanti yah</p>
<p>tasam brahma mahad yonir</p>
<p>aham bija-pradah pita</p>
<p>It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kunti, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father The different forms of these living entities are only their external dresses.</p>
<p>Every living being is actually a spirit soul, a part and parcel of God.</p>
<p>Therefore one should not favor only one kind of living being.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava sees all living entities as part and parcel of God.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (5.18 and Bg.18.54):</p>
<p>vidya-vinaya-sampanne</p>
<p>brahmane gavi hastini</p>
<p>suni caiva svapake ca</p>
<p>panditah sama-darsinah</p>
<p>The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater (outcaste)</p>
<p>brahma-bhutah prasannatma</p>
<p>na socati na kanksati</p>
<p>samah sarvesu bhutesu</p>
<p>mad-bhaktim labhate param</p>
<p>(Bg.18.54)</p>
<p>One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.</p>
<p>He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity.</p>
<p>In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me A Vaisnava, therefore, is truly a perfect person because he laments to see others unhappy and feels joy at seeing others happy.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is para-duhkha-duhkhi; he is always unhappy to see the conditioned souls in an unhappy state of materialism.</p>
<p>Therefore a Vaisnava is always busy preaching Krsna consciousness throughout the world.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.22.35):</p>
<p>etavaj janma-saphalyam</p>
<p>dehinam iha dehisu</p>

<p>sreya-acaranam sada</p>
<p>It is the duty of every living being to perform welfare activities for the benefit of others with his life, wealth, intelligence and words This is the mission of life.</p>
<p>One’s own body and the bodies of his friends and relatives, as well as one’s own riches and everything else one has, should be engaged for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>This is the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>As stated in Caitanya-caritamrta (Adi9.41):</p>
<p>bharata-bhumite haila manusya-janma yara</p>
<p>janma sarthaka kari’ kara para-upakara</p>
<p>One who has taken birth as a human being in the land of India (Bharata-varsa) should make his life successful and work for the benefit of all other people.</p>
<p>The word upakuryat means para-upakara, helping others.</p>
<p>Of course, in human society there are many institutions to help others, but because philanthropists do not know how to help others, their propensity for philanthropy is ineffectual.</p>
<p>They do not know the ultimate goal of life (sreya acaranam), which is to please the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>If all philanthropic and humanitarian activities were directed toward achieving the ultimate goal of life—to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead—they would all be perfect.</p>
<p>Humanitarian work without Krsna is nothing.</p>
<p>Krsna must be brought to the center of all our activities; otherwise no activity will have value.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Dadhici Muni, the son of Atharva, thus resolved to give his body to the service of the demigods.</p>
<p>He placed himself, the spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and in this way gave up his gross material body made of five elements.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As indicated by the words pare bhagavati brahmany atmanam sannayan, Dadhici placed himself, as spirit soul, at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.13.55).</p>
<p>Dhrtarastra analytically divided his gross material body into the five different elements of which it was made—earth, water, fire, air and ether—and distributed them to the different reservoirs of these elements; in other words, he merged these five elements into the original mahat-tattva.</p>
<p>By identifying his material conception of life, he gradually separated his spirit soul from material connections and placed himself at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The example given in this connection is that when an earthen pot is broken, the small portion of the sky within the pot is united with the large sky outside the pot.</p>
<p>Mayavadi philosophers misunderstand this description of Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>Therefore Sri Ramanuja Svami, in his book Vedanta-tattva-sara, has described that this merging of the soul means that after separating himself from the material body made of eight elements—earth, water, fire, air, ether, false ego, mind and intelligence—the individual soul engages himself in devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His eternal form (isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah/ anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam (Bs.5.1)).</p>
<p>The material cause of the material elements absorbs the material body, and the spiritual soul assumes its original position.</p>
<p>As described by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, jivera ‘svarupa’ haya—krsnera ‘nitya-dasa’: (Cc.Madhya 20.108) the constitutional position of the living entity is that he is the eternal servant of Krsna.</p>
<p>When one overcomes the material body through cultivation of spiritual knowledge and devotional service, one can revive his own position and thus engage in the service of the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Dadhici Muni controlled his senses, life force, mind and intelligence and became absorbed in trance.</p>
<p>Thus he cut all his material bonds.</p>
<p>He could not perceive how his material body became separated from his self.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (8.5):</p>
<p>anta-kale ca mam eva</p>
<p>smaran muktva kalevaram</p>
<p>yah prayati sa mad-bhavam</p>
<p>yati nasty atra samsayah</p>
<p>Whoever, at the time of death, quits his body remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature.</p>
<p>Of this there is no doubt Of course, one must practice before one is overcome by death, but the perfect yogi, namely the devotee, dies in trance, thinking of Krsna.</p>
<p>He does not feel his material body being separated from his soul; the soul is immediately transferred to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Tyaktva deham punar janma naiti mam eti: (Bg.4.9) the soul does not enter the womb of a material mother again but is transferred back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This yoga, bhakti-yoga, is the highest yoga system, as explained by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (Bg.6.47):</p>
<p>yoginam api sarvesam</p>
<p>mad-gatenantaratmana</p>
<p>sraddhavan bhajate yo mam</p>
<p>sa me yuktatamo matah</p>
<p>Of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all The bhakti-yogi always thinks of Krsna, and therefore at the time of death he can very easily transfer himself to Krsnaloka, without even perceiving the pains of death.</p>

<p>Like the Ganges River, the Narmada River also flows in the higher planetary systems.</p>
<p>The battle between the demigods and the demons took place in the higher planets.</p>
<p>The words prathame yuge mean in the beginning of the first millennium that is to say, in the beginning of the Vaivasvata manvantara.</p>
<p>In one day of Brahma there are fourteen Manus, who each live for seventy-one millenniums.</p>
<p>The four yugas—Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali—constitute one millennium.</p>
<p>We are presently in the manvantara of Vaivasvata Manu, who is mentioned in Bhagavad-gita (imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam/ vivasvan manave praha (Bg.4.1)).</p>
<p>We are now in the twenty-eighth millennium of Vaivasvata Manu, but this fight took place in the beginning of Vaivasvata Manu’s first millennium.</p>
<p>One can historically calculate how long ago the battle took place.</p>
<p>Since each millennium consists of 4,300,000 years and we are now in the twenty-eighth millennium, some 120,400,000 years have passed since the battle took place on the bank of the River Narmada.</p>

<p>Surrounded by his company, Indra shone so brightly that his effulgence was intolerable to the demons.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-10" id="summary-10">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#611-1" id="611-1">6.11</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes Vrtrasura’s great qualities.</p>
<p>When the prominent commanders of the demons fled, not hearing Vrtrasura’s advice.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura condemned them all as cowards.</p>
<p>Speaking very bravely, he stood alone to face the demigods.</p>
<p>When the demigods saw Vrtrasura’s attitude, they were so afraid that they practically fainted, and Vrtrasura began trampling them down.</p>
<p>Unable to tolerate this, Indra, the King of the demigods, threw his club at Vrtrasura, but Vrtrasura was such a great hero that he easily caught the club with his left hand and used it to beat Indra’s elephant.</p>
<p>Struck by the blow of Vrtrasura, the elephant was pushed back fourteen yards and fell, with Indra on its back.</p>
<p>King Indra had first accepted Visvarupa as his priest and thereafter killed him.</p>
<p>Reminding Indra of his heinous activities, Vrtrasura said, If one is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Visnu, and depends on Lord Visnu in every respect, then victory, opulence and peace of mind are all inevitably available.</p>
<p>Such a person has nothing for which to aspire in the three worlds.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is so kind that He especially favors such a devotee by not giving him opulence that will hamper his devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore I wish to give up everything for the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>I wish always to chant the glories of the Lord and engage in His service.</p>
<p>Let me become unattached to my worldly family and make friendships with the devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>I do not desire to be promoted to the higher planetary systems, even to Dhruvaloka or Brahmaloka, nor do I desire an unconquerable position within this material world.</p>
<p>I have no need for such things</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O demigods, these demoniac soldiers have taken birth uselessly.</p>
<p>Indeed, they have come from the bodies of their mothers exactly like stool.</p>
<p>What is the benefit of killing such enemies from behind while they are running in fear? One who considers himself a hero should not kill an enemy who is afraid of losing his life.</p>
<p>Such killing is never glorious, nor can it promote one to the heavenly planets.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Vrtrasura rebuked both the demigods and the demoniac soldiers because the demons were running in fear of their lives and the demigods were killing them from behind.</p>
<p>The actions of both were abominable.</p>
<p>When a fight takes place, the opposing parties must be prepared to fight like heroes.</p>
<p>A hero never runs from the field of battle.</p>
<p>He always fights face to face, determined to gain victory or lay down his life in the fight.</p>
<p>That is heroic.</p>
<p>Killing an enemy from behind is also inglorious.</p>
<p>When an enemy turns his back and runs in fear of his life, he should not be killed.</p>
<p>This is the etiquette of military science.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura insulted the demoniac soldiers by comparing them to the stool of their mothers.</p>
<p>Both stool and a cowardly son come from the abdomen of the mother, and Vrtrasura said that there is no difference between them.</p>
<p>A similar comparison was given by Tulasi dasa, who commented that a son and urine both come from the same channel.</p>
<p>In other words, semen and urine both come from the genitals, but semen produces a child whereas urine produces nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore if a child is neither a hero nor a devotee, he is not a son but urine.</p>
<p>Similarly, Canakya Pandita also says:</p>
<p>ko ’rthah putrena jatena</p>
<p>yo na vidvan na dharmikah</p>
<p>kanena caksusa kim va</p>
<p>caksuh pidaiva kevalam</p>
<p>What is the use of a son who is neither glorious nor devoted to the Lord? Such a son is like a blind eye, which simply gives pain but cannot help one see</p>

<p>Vrtrasura was certain that he would be killed in the battle with Indra, because this was the desire of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>He was prepared for death because he knew that after his death he was destined to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>This is a great destination, and it is achieved by the grace of a Vaisnava.</p>

<p>You need have no doubts about this.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When King Indra threw his club at Vrtrasura, Vrtrasura caught it in his left hand and retaliated by using it to strike the head of Indra’s elephant.</p>
<p>Thus Indra’s attack was a disastrous failure.</p>
<p>Indeed, Indra’s elephant was injured and thrown back fourteen yards.</p>
<p>Therefore even though Indra stood with the thunderbolt to hurl against Vrtrasura, he was doubtful, thinking that the thunderbolt might also fail.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura, however, being a Vaisnava, assured Indra that the thunderbolt would not fail, for Vrtrasura knew that it had been prepared in accordance with the instructions of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Although Indra had doubts because he could not understand that Lord Visnu’s order never fails, Vrtrasura understood Lord Visnu’s purpose.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura was eager to be killed by the thunderbolt manufactured according to Lord Visnu’s instructions because he was sure that he would thus return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>He was simply waiting for the opportunity of the thunderbolt’s being released.</p>
<p>In effect, therefore, Vrtrasura told Indra, If you want to kill me, since I am your enemy, take this opportunity.</p>

<p>You will gain victory, and I shall go back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Your deed will be equally beneficial for both of us.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Vrtrasura not only assured King Indra that the thunderbolt was invincible, but also encouraged Indra to use it against him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura was eager to die with the stroke of the thunderbolt sent by Lord Visnu so that he could immediately return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>By hurling the thunderbolt, Indra would gain victory and enjoy the heavenly planets, remaining in the material world for repeated birth and death.</p>
<p>Indra wanted to gain victory over Vrtrasura and thereby become happy, but that would not at all be happiness.</p>
<p>The heavenly planets are just below Brahmaloka, but as stated by the Supreme Lord, Krsna, abrahma-bhuvanal lokah punar avartino ’rjuna: (Bg.8.16) even if one achieves Brahmaloka, he must still fall to the lower planetary systems again and again.</p>
<p>However, if one goes back to Godhead, he never returns to this material world.</p>
<p>By killing Vrtrasura, Indra would not actually gain; he would remain in the material world.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura, however, would go to the spiritual world.</p>
<p>Therefore victory was destined for Vrtrasura, not for Indra.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The words aham samadhaya manah indicate that the most important duty at the time of death is to concentrate one’s mind.</p>
<p>If one can fix his mind on the lotus feet of Krsna, Visnu, Sankarsana or any Visnu murti, his life will be successful.</p>
<p>To be killed while fixing his mind at the lotus feet of Sankarsana, Vrtrasura asked Indra to release his vajra, or thunderbolt.</p>
<p>He was destined to be killed by the thunderbolt given by Lord Visnu; there was no question of its being baffled.</p>
<p>Therefore Vrtrasura requested Indra to release the thunderbolt immediately, and he prepared himself by fixing his mind at the lotus feet of Krsna.</p>
<p>A devotee is always ready to give up his material body, which is described herein as gramya-pasa, the rope of material attachment.</p>
<p>The body is not at all good; it is simply a cause of bondage to the material world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though the body is destined for destruction, fools and rascals invest all their faith in the body and are never eager to return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>Persons who fully surrender at the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and always think of His lotus feet are accepted and recognized by the Lord as His own personal assistants or servants.</p>
<p>The Lord never bestows upon such servants the brilliant opulences of the upper, lower and middle planetary systems of this material world.</p>
<p>When one possesses material opulence in any of these three divisions of the universe, his possessions naturally increase his enmity, anxiety, mental agitation, pride and belligerence.</p>
<p>Thus one goes through much endeavor to increase and maintain his possessions, and he suffers great unhappiness when he loses them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (4.11) the Lord says:</p>
<p>ye yatha mam prapadyante</p>
<p>tams tathaiva bhajamy aham</p>
<p>mama vartmanuvartante</p>
<p>manusyah partha sarvasah</p>
<p>As devotees surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly.</p>
<p>Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha Both Indra and Vrtrasura were certainly devotees of the Lord, although Indra took instructions from Visnu to kill Vrtrasura.</p>
<p>The Lord was actually more favorable to Vrtrasura because after being killed by Indra’s thunderbolt, Vrtrasura would go back to Godhead, whereas the victorious Indra would rot in this material world.</p>
<p>Because both of them were devotees, the Lord awarded them the respective benedictions they wanted.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura never wanted material possessions, for he knew very well the nature of such possessions.</p>
<p>To accumulate material possessions, one must labor very hard, and when he gets them he creates many enemies because this material world is always full of rivalry.</p>
<p>If one becomes rich, his friends or relatives are envious.</p>
<p>For ekanta-bhaktas, unalloyed devotees, Krsna therefore never provides material possessions.</p>
<p>A devotee sometimes needs some material possessions for preaching, but the possessions of a preacher are not like those of a karmi.</p>
<p>A karmi’s possessions are achieved as a result of karma, but those of a devotee are arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead just to facilitate his devotional activities.</p>
<p>Because a devotee never uses material possessions for any purpose other than the service of the Lord, the possessions of a devotee are not to be compared to those of a karmi.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>trai-vargika—for the three objectives, namely religiosity, economic development, and satisfaction of the senses; ayasa—of endeavor; vighatam—the ruin; asmat—our; patih—Lord; vidhatte—performs; purusasya—of a devotee; sakra—O Indra; tatah—whereby; anumeyah—to be inferred; bhagavat-prasadah—the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; yah—which; durlabhah—very difficult to obtain; akincana-gocarah—within the reach of the unalloyed devotees; anyaih—by others, who aspire for material happiness.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Our Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, forbids His devotees to endeavor uselessly for religion, economic development and sense gratification.</p>
<p>O Indra, one can thus infer how kind the Lord is.</p>
<p>Such mercy is obtainable only by unalloyed devotees, not by persons who aspire for material gains.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>There are four objectives in human life—namely, religiosity (dharma), economic development (artha), sense gratification (kama), and liberation (moksa) from the bondage of material existence.</p>
<p>People generally aspire for religiosity, economic development and sense gratification, but a devotee has no other desire than to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead both in this life and in the next.</p>
<p>The special mercy for the unalloyed devotee is that the Lord saves him from hard labor to achieve the results of religion, economic development and sense gratification.</p>
<p>Of course, if one wants such benefits, the Lord certainly awards them.</p>
<p>Indra, for example, although a devotee, was not much interested in release from material bondage; instead, he desired sense gratification and a high standard of material happiness in the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura, however, being an unalloyed devotee, aspired only to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord arranged for him to go back to Godhead after his bodily bondage was destroyed by Indra.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura requested Indra to release his thunderbolt against him as soon as possible so that both he and Indra would benefit according to their proportionate advancement in devotional service.</p>

<p>aham—I; hare—O my Lord; tava—of Your Lordship; pada-eka-mula—whose only shelter is the lotus feet; dasa-anudasah—the servant of Your servant; bhavitasmi—shall I become; bhuyah—again; manah—my mind; smareta—may remember; asu-pateh—of the Lord of my life; gunan—the attributes; te—of Your Lordship; grnita—may chant; vak—my words; karma—activities of service to You; karotu—may perform; kayah—my body.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, will I again be; able to be a servant of Your eternal servants who find shelter only at Your lotus feet? O Lord of my life, may I again become their servant so that my mind may always think of Your transcendental attributes, my words always glorify those attributes, and my body always engage in the loving service of Your Lordship?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse gives the sum and substance of devotional life.</p>
<p>One must first become a servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord (dasanudasa).</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu advised, and He also showed by His own example, that a living entity should always desire to be a servant of the servant of the servant of Krsna, the maintainer of the gopis (gopi-bhartuh pada-kamalayor dasa-dasanudasah).</p>
<p>This means that one must accept a spiritual master who comes in the disciplic succession and is a servant of the servant of the Lord.</p>
<p>Under his direction, one must then engage one’s three properties, namely his body, mind and words.</p>
<p>The body should be engaged in physical activity under the order of the master, the mind should think of Krsna incessantly, and one’s words should be engaged in preaching the glories of the Lord.</p>
<p>If one is thus engaged in the loving service of the Lord, one’s life is successful.</p>

<p>A pure devotee desires only to engage in loving service to the Lord in the constant association of the Lord and His eternal associates, as stated in the previous verse (dasanudaso bhavitasmi).</p>
<p>As confirmed by Narottama dasa Thakura:</p>
<p>tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa</p>
<p>janame janame haya, ei abhilasa</p>
<p>To serve the Lord and the servants of His servants, in the association of devotees, is the only objective of a pure, unalloyed devotee.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-11" id="summary-11">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#612-1" id="612-1">6.12</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes how Indra, the King of heaven, killed Vrtrasura despite great reluctance.</p>
<p>After Vrtrasura finished speaking, he released his trident against King Indra with great anger, but Indra, using his thunderbolt, which was many times more powerful than the trident, broke the trident to pieces and cut off one of Vrtrasura’s arms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Vrtrasura used his remaining arm to strike Indra with an iron mace, making the thunderbolt fall from Indra’s hand.</p>
<p>Indra, being very ashamed of this, did not pick up the thunderbolt from the ground, but Vrtrasura encouraged King Indra to pick it up and fight.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura then spoke to King Indra as follows, instructing him very well The Supreme Personality of Godhead he said, is the cause of victory and defeat.</p>
<p>Not knowing that the Supreme Lord is the cause of all causes, fools and rascals try to take credit for victory or defeat themselves, but everything is actually under the control of the Lord.</p>
<p>No one but Him has any independence.</p>
<p>The purusa (the enjoyer) and prakrti (the enjoyed) are under the control of the Lord, for it is by His supervision that everything works systematically.</p>
<p>Not seeing the hand of the Supreme in every action, a fool considers himself the ruler and controller of everything.</p>
<p>When one understands, however, that the real controller is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is freed from the relativities of the world, such as distress, happiness, fear and impurity Thus Indra and Vrtrasura not only fought, but also engaged in philosophical discourses.</p>
<p>Then they began to fight again.</p>
<p>This time Indra was more powerful, and he severed Vrtrasura’s remaining arm.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura then assumed a gigantic form and swallowed King Indra, but Indra, being protected by the talisman known as Narayana-kavaca, was able to protect himself even within Vrtrasura’s body.</p>
<p>Thus he emerged from Vrtrasura’s abdomen and severed the demon’s head from his body with his powerful thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Severing the demon’s head took one complete year to accomplish.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami said: Desiring to give up his body, Vrtrasura considered death in the battle preferable to victory.</p>
<p>O King Pariksit, he vigorously took up his trident and with great force attacked Lord Indra, the King of heaven, just as Kaitabha had forcefully attacked the Supreme Personality of Godhead when the universe was inundated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Vrtrasura repeatedly encouraged Indra to kill him with the thunderbolt, King Indra was morose at having to kill such a great devotee and was hesitant to throw it.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura, disappointed that King Indra was reluctant despite his encouragement, took the initiative very forcefully by throwing his trident at Indra.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura was not at all interested in victory; he was interested in being killed so that he could immediately return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), tyaktva deham punar janma naiti: after giving up his body, a devotee immediately returns to Lord Krsna and never returns to accept another body.</p>
<p>This was Vrtrasura’s interest.</p>

<p>Vrtrasura continued: O Indra, no one is guaranteed of being always victorious but the original enjoyer, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavan.</p>
<p>He is the cause of creation, maintenance and annihilation, and He knows everything.</p>
<p>Being dependent and being obliged to accept material bodies, belligerent subordinates are sometimes victorious and sometimes defeated.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15):</p>
<p>sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto</p>
<p>mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca</p>
<p>I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness When two parties fight, the fighting actually goes on under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is Paramatma, the Supersoul.</p>
<p>Gita (3.27) the Lord says:</p>
<p>prakrteh kriyamanani</p>
<p>gunaih karmani sarvasah</p>
<p>ahankara-vimudhatma</p>
<p>kartaham iti manyate</p>
<p>The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature The living entities work only under the direction of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord gives orders to material nature, and she arranges facilities for the living entities.</p>
<p>The living entities are not independent, although they foolishly think themselves the doers (karta).</p>
<p>Victory is always with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As for the subordinate living entities, they fight under the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Victory or defeat is not actually theirs; it is an arrangement by the Lord through the agency of material nature.</p>
<p>Pride in victory, or moroseness in defeat, is useless.</p>
<p>One should fully depend on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is responsible for the victory and defeat of all living entities.</p>
<p>The Lord advises, niyatam kuru karma tvam karma jyayo hy akarmanah: Perform your prescribed duty, for action is better than inaction The living entity is ordered to act according to his position.</p>
<p>Victory or defeat depends on the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Karmany evadhikaras te ma phalesu kadacana: You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of actions One must act sincerely, according to his position.</p>
<p>Victory or defeat depends on the Lord.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura encouraged Indra, saying, Don’t be morose because of my victory.</p>
<p>There is no need to stop fighting.</p>
<p>Instead, you should go on with your duty.</p>
<p>When Krsna desires, you will certainly be victorious This verse is very instructive for sincere workers in the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>We should not be jubilant in victory or morose in defeat.</p>
<p>We should make a sincere effort to implement the will of Krsna, or Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, and we should not be concerned with victory and defeat.</p>
<p>Our only duty is to work sincerely, so that our activities may be recognized by Krsna.</p>

<p>They work like birds caught in a net, who cannot move independently.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The difference between the suras and the asuras is that the suras know that nothing can happen without the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the asuras cannot understand the supreme will of the Lord.</p>
<p>In this fight, Vrtrasura is actually the sura, whereas Indra is the asura.</p>
<p>No one can act independently; rather, everyone acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore victory and defeat come according to the results of one’s karma, and the judgment is given by the Supreme Lord (karmana-daiva-netrena).</p>
<p>Since we act under the control of the Supreme according to our karma, no one is independent, from Brahma down to the insignificant ant.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The three purusas—Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi-Visnu—the material nature, the total material energy, the false ego, the five material elements, the material senses, the mind, the intelligence and consciousness cannot create the material manifestation without the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As confirmed in the Visnu Purana, parasya brahmanah saktis tathedam akhilam jagat: whatever manifestations we experience are nothing but various energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>These energies cannot create anything independently.</p>
<p>This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (9.10): mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kunti, and it is producing all moving and unmoving living beings Only under the direction of the Lord, the Supreme Person, can prakrti, which is manifested in twenty-four elements, create different situations for the living entity.</p>
<p>In the Vedas the Lord says:</p>
<p>madiyam mahimanam ca</p>
<p>parabrahmeti sabditam</p>
<p>vetsyasy anugrhitam me</p>
<p>samprasnair vivrtam hrdi</p>
<p>Since everything is a manifestation of My energy, I am known as Parabrahman.</p>
<p>Therefore everyone should hear from Me about My glorious activities The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gita (10.2), aham adir hi devanam: I am the origin of all the demigods Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of everything, and no one is independent of Him.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya also says, anisa jiva-rupena: the living entity is anisa, never the controller, but is always controlled.</p>
<p>Therefore when a living entity becomes proud of being an independent isvara, or god, that is his foolishness.</p>
<p>Such foolishness is described in the following verse.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#61212" id="61212">6.12.12</a></h3>
<p>avidvan evam atmanam</p>
<p>manyate ’nisam isvaram</p>
<p>bhutaih srjati bhutani</p>
<p>grasate tani taih svayam</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>avidvan—one who is foolish, without knowledge; evam—thus; atmanam—himself; manyate—considers; anisam—although totally dependent on others; isvaram—as the supreme controller, independent; bhutaih—by the living entities; srjati—He (the Lord) creates; bhutani—other living entities; grasate—He devours; tani—them; taih—by other living beings; svayam—Himself.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A foolish, senseless person cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Although always dependent, he falsely thinks himself the Supreme.</p>
<p>If one thinks, According to one’s previous fruitive actions, one’s material body is created by the father and mother, and the same body is annihilated by another agent, as another animal is devoured by a tiger this is not proper understanding.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself creates and devours the living beings through other living beings.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>According to the conclusion of the philosophy known as karma-mimamsa, one’s karma, or previous fruitive activity, is the cause of everything, and therefore there is no need to work.</p>
<p>Those who arrive at this conclusion are foolish.</p>
<p>When a father creates a child, he does not do so independently; he is induced to do so by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>As the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: I am in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness Unless one receives dictation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sits within everyone’s heart, one cannot be induced to create anything.</p>
<p>Therefore the father and mother are not the creators of the living entity.</p>
<p>According to the living entity’s karma, fruitive activities, he is put into the semen of the father, who injects the living entity into the womb of the mother.</p>
<p>Then according to the body of the mother and father (yatha-yoni yatha-bijam), the living entity accepts a body and takes birth to suffer or enjoy.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Lord is the original cause of one’s birth.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the cause of one’s being killed.</p>
<p>No one is independent; everyone is dependent.</p>
<p>The true conclusion is that the only independent person is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>ayuh—longevity; srih—opulence; kirtih—fame; aisvaryam—power; asisah—benedictions; purusasya—of the living entity; yah—which; bhavanti—arise; eva—indeed; hi—certainly; tat-kale—at that proper time; yatha—just as; anicchoh—of one not desiring; viparyayah—reverse conditions.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just as a person not inclined to die must nonetheless give up his longevity, opulence, fame and everything else at the time of death, so, at the appointed time of victory, one can gain all these when the Supreme Lord awards them by His mercy.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is not good to be falsely puffed up, saying that by one’s own effort one has become opulent, learned, beautiful and so on.</p>
<p>All such good fortune is achieved through the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>From another point of view, no one wants to die, and no one wants to be poor or ugly.</p>
<p>Therefore, why does the living entity, against his will, receive such unwanted troubles? It is due to the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that one gains or loses everything material.</p>
<p>No one is independent; everyone is dependent on the mercy or chastisement of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>There is a common saying in Bengal that the Lord has ten hands.</p>
<p>This means that He has control everywhere—in the eight directions and up and down.</p>
<p>If He wants to take everything away from us with His ten hands, we cannot protect anything with our two hands.</p>
<p>Similarly, if He wants to bestow benedictions upon us with His ten hands, we cannot factually receive them all with our two hands; in other words, the benedictions exceed our ambitions.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that even though we do not wish to be separated from our possessions, sometimes the Lord forcibly takes them from us; and sometimes He showers such benedictions upon us that we are unable to receive them all.</p>
<p>Therefore either in opulence or in distress we are not independent; everything is dependent on the sweet will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>Since everything is dependent on the supreme will of the Personality of Godhead, one should be equipoised in fame and defamation, victory and defeat, life and death.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>One who knows that the three qualities—goodness, passion and ignorance—are not qualities of the soul but qualities of material nature, and who knows that the pure soul is simply an observer of the actions and reactions of these qualities, should be understood to be a liberated person.</p>
<p>He is not bound by these qualities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As the Lord explains in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):</p>
<p>brahma-bhutah prasannatma</p>
<p>na socati na kanksati</p>
<p>samah sarvesu bhutesu</p>
<p>mad-bhaktim labhate param</p>
<p>One who is transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.</p>
<p>He never laments or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity.</p>
<p>In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me When one attains self-realization, the brahma-bhuta stage, one knows that whatever happens during his life is due to the contamination of the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>The living being, the pure soul, has nothing to do with these modes.</p>
<p>In the midst of the hurricane of the material world, everything changes very quickly, but if one remains silent and simply observes the actions and reactions of the hurricane, he is understood to be liberated.</p>
<p>The real qualification of the liberated soul is that he remains Krsna conscious, undisturbed by the actions and reactions of the material energy.</p>
<p>Such a liberated person is always jubilant.</p>
<p>He never laments or aspires for anything.</p>
<p>Since everything is supplied by the Supreme Lord, the living entity, being fully dependent on Him, should not protest or accept anything in terms of his personal sense gratification; rather, he should receive everything as the mercy of the Lord and remain steady in all circumstances.</p>

<p>King Indra, the greatest of the demigods, was astonished to hear the instructions of Vrtrasura, who was supposed to be a demon.</p>
<p>He was struck with wonder that a demon could speak so intelligently.</p>
<p>Then he remembered great devotees like Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja, who had been born in the families of demons, and thus he came to his senses.</p>

<p>You have surmounted the illusory energy of Lord Visnu, and because of this liberation, you have given up the demoniac mentality and have attained the position of an exalted devotee.</p>

<p>Lord Visnu is the maha-purusa.</p>
<p>Therefore one who becomes a Vaisnava attains the position of a maha-paurusya.</p>
<p>This position was attained by Maharaja Pariksit.</p>
<p>It is said in the Padma Purana that the distinction between a demigod and a demon is that a demigod is a devotee of Lord Visnu whereas a demon is just the opposite: visnu-bhaktah smrto daiva asuras tad-viparyayah.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura was considered a demon, but actually he was more than qualified as a devotee, or maha-paurusya.</p>
<p>If one somehow becomes a devotee of the Supreme Lord, whatever his position, he can be brought to the position of a perfect person.</p>
<p>This is possible if an unalloyed devotee tries to serve the Lord by delivering him in this way.</p>

<p>King Indra wondered how Vrtrasura could have been elevated to the position of an exalted devotee.</p>
<p>As for Prahlada Maharaja, he was initiated by Narada Muni, and therefore it was possible for him to become a great devotee, although he was born in a family of demons.</p>
<p>For Vrtrasura, however, Indra could not detect such causes.</p>

<p>I simply want to return home, back to Godhead This is the determination of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>A pure devotee is never attracted to any exalted position within this material world.</p>

<p>He wants to associate with Krsna’s atmosphere of Vrndavana’s beauty.</p>
<p>These are the highest ambitions of a devotee of Krsna.</p>

<p>Thus assuming a gigantic body, the great demon Vrtrasura shook even the mountains and began crushing the surface of the earth with his legs, as if he were the Himalayas walking about.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-12" id="summary-12">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#613-1" id="613-1">6.13</a></h3>
<p>This chapter describes Indra’s fear at having killed a brahmana (Vrtrasura), and it also describes how he fled and was saved by the grace of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>When all the demigods requested Indra to kill Vrtrasura, he refused because Vrtrasura was a brahmana.</p>
<p>The demigods, however, encouraged Indra not to fear killing him because Indra was protected by the Narayana-kavaca, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Even by a glimpse of the chanting of Narayana’s name, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing a woman, a cow or a brahmana.</p>
<p>The demigods advised Indra to perform an asvamedha sacrifice, by which Narayana would be pleased, for the performer of such a sacrifice is not implicated in sinful reactions even if he kills the entire universe.</p>
<p>Following this instruction from the demigods, King Indra fought Vrtrasura, but when Vrtrasura was killed, everyone was satisfied but King Indra, who knew Vrtrasura’s position.</p>
<p>This is the nature of a great personality.</p>
<p>Even if a great personality acquires some opulence, he is always ashamed and regretful if he acquires it illegally.</p>
<p>Indra could understand that he was certainly entangled by sinful reactions for killing a brahmana.</p>
<p>Indeed, he could see sinful reaction personified following him, and thus he fled here and there in fear, thinking of how to rid himself of his sins.</p>
<p>He went to Manasa-sarovara, and there, under the protection of the goddess of fortune, he meditated for one thousand years.</p>
<p>During this time, Nahusa reigned over the heavenly planets as the representative of Indra.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, he was attracted by the beauty of Indra’s wife, Sacidevi, and because of his sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent in his next life.</p>
<p>Indra later performed a great sacrifice with the help of exalted brahmanas and saints.</p>
<p>In this way he was released from the reactions of his sinful killing of a brahmana.</p>

<p>When he left the lake, he performed an asvamedha-yajna and then returned to his own abode.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O great sage, what was the reason for Indra’s unhappiness? I wish to hear about this.</p>
<p>When he killed Vrtrasura, all the demigods were extremely happy.</p>
<p>Why, then, was Indra himself unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This, of course, is a very intelligent question.</p>
<p>When a demon is killed, certainly all the demigods are happy.</p>
<p>In this case, however, when all the demigods were happy because of Vrtrasura’s having been killed, Indra was unhappy.</p>
<p>Why? It may be suggested that Indra was unhappy because he knew that he had killed a great devotee and brahmana.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura outwardly appeared to be a demon, but inwardly he was a great devotee and therefore a great brahmana.</p>
<p>Herein it is clearly indicated that a person who is not at all demoniac, such as Prahlada Maharaja and Bali Maharaja, may outwardly be a demon or be born in a family of demons.</p>
<p>Therefore in terms of real culture one should not be considered a demigod or demon simply according to birth.</p>
<p>In his dealings while fighting with Indra, Vrtrasura proved himself a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as soon as he finished fighting with Indra and was apparently killed, Vrtrasura was transferred to Vaikunthaloka to become an associate of Sankarsana.</p>
<p>Indra knew this, and therefore he was morose at having killed such a demon, who was actually a Vaisnava or brahmana.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is already a brahmana, although a brahmana may not be a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>The Padma Purana says:</p>
<p>sat-karma-nipuno vipro</p>
<p>mantra-tantra-visaradah</p>
<p>avaisnavo gurur na syad</p>
<p>vaisnavah sva-paco guruh</p>
<p>One may be a brahmana in terms of his culture and family and may be expert in Vedic knowledge (mantra-tantra-visaradah), but if he is not a Vaisnava, he cannot be a guru.</p>
<p>This means that an expert brahmana may not be a Vaisnava, but a Vaisnava is already a brahmana.</p>
<p>A millionaire may very easily possess hundreds and thousands of dollars, but a person with hundreds and thousands of dollars is not necessarily a millionaire.</p>
<p>Vrtrasura was a perfect Vaisnava, and therefore he was also a brahmana.</p>

<p>But you are a devotee, and we shall help you by performing the great horse sacrifice.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said in the Brhad-visnu Purana:</p>
<p>namno hi yavati saktih</p>
<p>papa-nirharane hareh</p>
<p>tavat kartum na saknoti</p>
<p>patakam pataki narah</p>
<p>Also, in the Prema-vivarta by Jagadananda Pandita it is said:</p>
<p>eka krsna-name papira yata papa-ksaya</p>
<p>bahu janme sei papi karite naraya</p>
<p>This means that by once chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can be freed from the reactions of more sins that he can even imagine performing.</p>
<p>The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities.</p>
<p>What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy name.</p>
<p>Such a mentality is a most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name.</p>
<p>Namno balad yasya hi papa-buddhih: the Lord’s holy name certainly has the potency to neutralize all sinful activities, but if one repeatedly and intentionally commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most condemned.</p>
<p>These verses name the performers of various sinful deeds.</p>
<p>In the Manu-samhita the following names are given.</p>
<p>A son begotten by a brahmana and born from the womb of a sudra mother is called a parasava or nisada, a hunter accustomed to stealing.</p>
<p>A son begotten by a nisada in the womb of a sudra woman is called a pukkasa.</p>
<p>A child begotten by a ksatriya in the womb of the daughter of a sudra is called an ugra.</p>
<p>A child begotten by a sudra in the womb of the daughter of a ksatriya is called a ksatta.</p>
<p>A child begotten by a ksatriya in the womb of a lower-class woman is called a svada, or dog-eater.</p>
<p>All such offspring are considered extremely sinful, but the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so strong that all of them can be purified simply by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>The Hare Krsna movement offers everyone a chance to be purified, regardless of birth or family.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (2.4.18):</p>
<p>kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasa</p>
<p>abhira-sumbha yavanah khasadayah</p>
<p>ye ’nye ca papa yad-apasrayasrayah</p>
<p>sudhyanti tasmai prabhavisnave namah</p>
<p>Kiratas, Hunas, Andhras, Pulindas, Pulkasas, Abhiras, Sumbhas, Yavanas, members of the Khasa races, and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of devotees of the Lord, for He is the supreme power.</p>
<p>I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him Even such sinful persons can certainly all be purified if they chant the holy name of the Lord under the direction of a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Herein the sages encourage King Indra to kill Vrtrasura even at the risk of brahma-hatya, the killing of a brahmana, and they guarantee to release him from sinful reactions by performing an asvamedha-yajna.</p>
<p>Such purposefully devised atonement, however, cannot relieve the performer of sinful acts.</p>
<p>This will be seen from the following verse.</p>

<p>sri-sukah uvaca—Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said; evam—thus; sancoditah—being encouraged; vipraih—by the brahmanas; marutvan—Indra; ahanat—killed; ripum—his enemy, Vrtrasura; brahma-hatya—the sinful reaction for killing a brahmana; hate—was killed; tasmin—when he (Vrtrasura); asasada—approached; vrsakapim—Indra, who is also named Vrsakapi.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami said: Encouraged by the words of the sages, Indra killed Vrtrasura, and when he was killed the sinful reaction for killing a brahmana (brahma-hatya) certainly took shelter of Indra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>After killing Vrtrasura, Indra could not surpass the brahma-hatya, the sinful reactions for killing a brahmana.</p>
<p>Formerly he had killed one brahmana, Visvarupa, out of circumstantial anger, but this time, following the advice of the sages, he killed another brahmana purposely.</p>
<p>Therefore the sinful reaction was greater than before.</p>
<p>Indra could not be relieved from the reaction simply by performing sacrifices for atonement.</p>
<p>He had to undergo a severe series of sinful reactions, and when he was freed by such suffering, the brahmanas allowed him to perform the horse sacrifice.</p>
<p>The planned execution of sinful deeds on the strength of chanting the holy name of the Lord or undergoing prayascitta, atonement, cannot give relief to anyone, even to Indra or Nahusa.</p>
<p>Nahusa was officiating for Indra while Indra, absent from heaven, was going here and there to gain release from his sinful reactions.</p>

<p>One cannot be happy by committing sinful acts, even if one is endowed with material opulence.</p>
<p>Indra found this to be true.</p>
<p>People began to blaspheme him, saying, This person has killed a brahmana for the sake of enjoying heavenly material happiness Therefore in spite of being King of heaven and enjoying material opulence, Indra was always unhappy because of the accusations of the populace.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-13" id="summary-13">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#614" id="614">6.14</a></h3>
<p>In this Fourteenth Chapter, Pariksit Maharaja asks his spiritual master, Sukadeva Gosvami, how such a demon as Vrtrasura could become an exalted devotee.</p>
<p>In this connection the previous life of Vrtrasura is discussed.</p>
<p>This involves the story of Citraketu and how he was victimized by lamentation because of the death of his son.</p>
<p>Among many millions of living entities, the number of human beings is extremely small, and among human beings who are actually religious, only some are eager to be liberated from material existence.</p>
<p>Among many thousands of people who desire relief from material existence, one is freed from the association of unwanted persons or is relieved of material contamination.</p>
<p>And among many millions of such liberated persons, one may become a devotee of Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Therefore such devotees are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Since bhakti, devotional service, is not ordinary, Pariksit Maharaja was astonished that an asura could rise to the exalted position of a devotee.</p>
<p>Being doubtful, Pariksit Maharaja inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami, who then described Vrtrasura with reference to his previous birth as Citraketu, the King of Surasena.</p>
<p>Citraketu, who had no sons, got an opportunity to meet the great sage Angira.</p>
<p>When Angira inquired from the King about his welfare, the King expressed his moroseness, and therefore by the grace of the great sage, the King’s first wife, Krtadyuti, gave birth to a son, who was the cause of both happiness and lamentation.</p>
<p>Upon the birth of this son, the King and all the residents of the palace were very happy.</p>
<p>The co-wives of Krtadyuti, however, were envious, and later they administered poison to the child.</p>
<p>Citraketu was overwhelmed by shock at his son’s death.</p>
<p>Then Narada Muni and Angira went to see him.</p>

<p>King Pariksit inquired from Sukadeva Gosvami: O learned brahmana, demons are generally sinful, being obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>How, then, could Vrtrasura have attained such exalted love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this material world, everyone is obsessed with the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>However, unless one conquers these modes and comes to the platform of goodness, there is no chance of one’s becoming a pure devotee.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by Lord Krsna Himself in Bhagavad-gita (7.28):</p>
<p>yesam tv anta-gatam papam</p>
<p>jananam punya-karmanam</p>
<p>te dvandva-moha-nirmukta</p>

<p>Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination Since Vrtrasura was among the demons, Maharaja Pariksit wondered how it was possible for him to have become such an exalted devotee.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or Krsna.</p>
<p>Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura gives the following purport to this verse.</p>
<p>Simply desiring mukti, or liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated.</p>
<p>When one understands the futility of the materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the vanaprastha order, unattached to family, wife and children.</p>
<p>One should then further progress to the platform of sannyasa, the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life.</p>
<p>Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated.</p>
<p>Only rarely is someone liberated.</p>
<p>Indeed, although many men take sannyasa to become liberated, because of their imperfections they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on.</p>
<p>Jnanis, yogis and karmis devoid of devotional service are called offenders.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, mayavadi krsne aparadhi: one who thinks that everything is maya instead of thinking that everything is Krsna is called an aparadhi, or offender.</p>
<p>Although the Mayavadis, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of Krsna, they may nonetheless be counted among the siddhas, those who have realized the self.</p>
<p>They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life is.</p>
<p>If such a person becomes narayana-parayana, a devotee of Lord Narayana, he is better than a jivan-mukta, one who is liberated or perfect.</p>
<p>This requires higher intelligence.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of jnanis.</p>
<p>One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal realization.</p>
<p>Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (sthula-tusavaghatinah).</p>
<p>The other class of jnanis, whose jnana is mixed with bhakti, are also of two kinds—those who are devoted to the so-called false form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1), the actual spiritual form.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi devotees worship Narayana or Visnu with the idea that Visnu has accepted a form of maya and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal.</p>
<p>The pure devotee, however, never thinks that Visnu has accepted a body of maya; instead, he knows perfectly well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Such a devotee is actually situated in knowledge.</p>
<p>He never merges in the Brahman effulgence.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (10.2.32):</p>
<p>ye ’nye ’ravindaksa vimukta-maninas</p>
<p>tvayy asta-bhavad avisuddha-buddhayah</p>
<p>aruhya krcchrena param padam tatah</p>
<p>patanty adho ’nadrta-yusmad-anghrayah</p>
<p>O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure.</p>
<p>Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet Evidence of this same point is also given in Bhagavad-gita (9.11), wherein the Lord says:</p>
<p>avajananti mam mudha</p>
<p>manusim tanum asritam</p>
<p>param bhavam ajananto</p>
<p>mama bhuta-mahesvaram</p>
<p>(Bg.9.11)</p>
<p>Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form.</p>
<p>They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be When rascals (mudhas) see that Krsna acts exactly like a human being, they deride the transcendental form of the Lord because they do not know the param bhavam, His transcendental form and activities.</p>
<p>Such persons are further described in Bhagavad-gita (9.12) as follows:</p>
<p>moghasa mogha-karmano</p>
<p>mogha-jnana vicetasah</p>
<p>raksasim asurim caiva</p>
<p>prakrtim mohinim sritah</p>
<p>Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views.</p>
<p>In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated Such persons do not know that Krsna’s body is not material.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between Krsna’s body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see Krsna as a human being, they deride Him.</p>
<p>They cannot imagine how a person like Krsna could be the origin of everything (govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami ).</p>
<p>Such persons are described as moghasah, baffled in their hopes.</p>
<p>Whatever they desire for the future will be baffled.</p>
<p>Even if they apparently engage in devotional service, they are described as moghasah because they ultimately desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence.</p>
<p>Those who aspire to be elevated to the heavenly planets by devotional service will also be frustrated, because this is not the result of devotional service.</p>
<p>However, they are also given a chance to engage in devotional service and be purified.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17):</p>
<p>srnvatam sva-kathah krsnah</p>
<p>punya-sravana-kirtanah</p>
<p>hrdy antah-stho hy abhadrani</p>
<p>vidhunoti suhrt satam</p>
<p>Sri Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma (Supersoul) in everyone’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted Unless the dirt within the core of one’s heart is cleansed away, one cannot become a pure devotee.</p>
<p>Therefore the word sudurlabhah (very rarely foun) is used in this verse.</p>
<p>Not only among hundreds and thousands, but among millions of perfectly liberated souls, a pure devotee is hardly ever found.</p>
<p>Therefore the words kotisv api are used herein.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya gives the following quotations from the Tantra Bhagavata:</p>
<p>nava-kotyas tu devanam</p>
<p>rsayah sapta-kotayah</p>
<p>narayanayanah sarve</p>
<p>ye kecit tat-parayanah</p>
<p>There are ninety million demigods and seventy million sages, who are all called narayanayana, devotees of Lord Narayana.</p>
<p>Among them, only a few are called narayana-parayana</p>
<p>narayanayana deva</p>
<p>rsy-adyas tat-parayanah</p>
<p>brahmadyah kecanaiva syuh</p>
<p>siddho yogya-sukham labhan</p>
<p>The difference between the siddhas and narayana-parayanas is that direct devotees are called narayana-parayanas whereas those who perform various types of mystic yoga are called siddhas.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, in the province of Surasena there was a king named Citraketu, who ruled the entire earth.</p>
<p>During his reign, the earth produced all the necessities for life.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here the most significant statement is that the earth completely produced all the necessities of life during the time of King Citraketu.</p>
<p>As stated in the Isopanisad (Mantra1):</p>
<p>isavasyam idam sarvam</p>
<p>yat kinca jagatyam jagat</p>
<p>tena tyaktena bhunjitha</p>
<p>ma grdhah kasya svid dhanam</p>
<p>Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord.</p>
<p>One should therefore accept only those things necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota, and one should not accept other things, knowing well to whom they belong Krsna, the supreme controller, has created the material world, which is completely perfect and free from scarcity.</p>
<p>The Lord supplies the necessities of all living entities.</p>
<p>These necessities come from the earth, and thus the earth is the source of supply.</p>
<p>When there is a good ruler, that source produces the necessities of life abundantly.</p>
<p>However, when there is not such a good ruler, there will be scarcity.</p>
<p>This is the significance of the word kamadhuk.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.10.4) it is said, kamam vavarsa parjanyah sarva-kama-dugha mahi: During the reign of Maharaja Yudhisthira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of men in profusion We have experience that in some seasons the rains produce abundance and in other seasons there is scarcity.</p>
<p>We have no control over the earth’s productiveness, for it is naturally under the full control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>By His order, the Lord can make the earth produce sufficiently or insufficiently.</p>
<p>If a pious king rules the earth according to the sastric injunctions, there will naturally be regular rainfall and sufficient produce to provide for all men.</p>
<p>There will be no question of exploitation, for everyone will have enough.</p>
<p>Black-marketeering and other corrupt dealings will then automatically stop.</p>
<p>Simply ruling the land cannot solve man’s problems unless the leader has spiritual capabilities.</p>
<p>He must be like Maharaja Yudhisthira, Pariksit Maharaja or Ramacandra.</p>
<p>Then all the inhabitants of the land will be extremely happy.</p>

<p>Citraketu, the husband of these millions of wives, was endowed with a beautiful form, magnanimity and youth.</p>
<p>He was born in a high family, he had a complete education, and he was wealthy and opulent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in spite of being endowed with all these assets, he was full of anxiety because he did not have a son.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It appears that the King first married one wife, but she could not bear a child.</p>
<p>Then he married a second, a third, a fourth and so on, but none of the wives could bear children.</p>
<p>In spite of the material assets of janmaisvarya-sruta-sri—birth in an aristocratic family with full opulence, wealth, education and beauty—he was very much aggrieved because in spite of having so many wives, he had no son.</p>
<p>Certainly his grief was natural.</p>
<p>Grhastha life does not mean having a wife and no children.</p>
<p>Canakya Pandita says, putra-hinam grham sunyam: if a family man has no son, his home is no better than a desert.</p>
<p>The King was certainly most unhappy that he could not get a son, and this is why he had married so many times.</p>
<p>Ksatriyas especially are allowed to marry more than one wife, and this King did so.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he had no issue.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great sage Angira said: My dear King, I hope that your body and mind and your royal associates and paraphernalia are well.</p>
<p>When the seven properties of material nature (the total material energy, the ego and the five objects of sense gratification) are in proper order, the living entity within the material elements is happy.</p>
<p>Without these seven elements one cannot exist.</p>
<p>Similarly, a king is always protected by seven elements—his instructor (svami or guru), his ministers, his kingdom, his fort, his treasury, his royal order and his friends.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As it is quoted by Sridhara Svami in his Bhagavatam commentary:</p>
<p>svamy-amatyau janapada</p>
<p>durga-dravina-sancayah</p>
<p>dando mitram ca tasyaitah</p>
<p>sapta-prakrtayo matah</p>
<p>A king is not alone.</p>
<p>He first has his spiritual master, the supreme guide.</p>
<p>Then come his ministers, his kingdom, his fortifications, his treasury, his system of law and order, and his friends or allies.</p>
<p>If these seven are properly maintained, the king is happy.</p>
<p>Similarly, as explained in Bhagavad-gita (dehino ’smin yatha dehe (Bg.2.13)), the living entity, the soul, is within the material covering of the mahat-tattva, ego and panca-tanmatra, the five objects of sense gratification.</p>
<p>When these seven are in proper order, the living entity is in a mood of pleasure.</p>
<p>Generally when the associates of the king are quiet and obedient, the king can be happy.</p>
<p>Therefore the great sage Angira Rsi inquired about the King’s personal health and the good fortune of his seven associates.</p>
<p>When we inquire from a friend whether everything is well, we are concerned not only with his personal self but also with his family, his source of income, and his assistants or servants.</p>
<p>All of them must be well, and then a person can be happy.</p>

<p>The actual happiness of a king and his dependents is described in this verse.</p>
<p>A king should not simply give orders to his dependents because he is supreme; sometimes he must follow their instructions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the dependents should depend on the king.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the great sage told the King, O great King, now you will have a son who will be the cause of both jubilation and lamentation The sage then left, without waiting for Citraketu’s response.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word harsa means jubilation and soka means lamentation The King was overwhelmed with joy when he understood that he would have a son.</p>
<p>Because of his great jubilation, he could not actually understand the statement of the sage Angira.</p>
<p>He accepted it to mean that there would certainly be jubilation because of the birth of his future son, but that he would be the King’s only son and, being very proud of his great wealth and empire, would not be very obedient to his father.</p>
<p>Thus the King was satisfied, thinking, Let there be a son.</p>
<p>It does not matter if he is not very obedient In Bengal there is a proverb that instead of having no maternal uncle, it is better to have a maternal uncle who is blind.</p>
<p>The King accepted this philosophy, thinking that a disobedient son would be better than no son at all.</p>
<p>The great sage Canakya Pandita says:</p>
<p>ko ’rthah putrena jatena</p>
<p>yo na vidvan na dharmikah</p>
<p>kanena caksusa kim va</p>
<p>caksuh pidaiva kevalam</p>
<p>What is the use of a son who is neither a learned scholar nor a devotee? Such a son is like a blind, diseased eye, which always causes suffering Nevertheless, the material world is so polluted that one wants to have a son even though he is useless.</p>
<p>This attitude was represented in the history of King Citraketu.</p>

<p>When King Citraketu heard of his son’s death from unknown causes, he became almost blind.</p>
<p>Because of his great affection for his son, his lamentation grew like a blazing fire, and as he went to see the dead child, he kept slipping and falling on the ground.</p>
<p>Surrounded by his ministers and other officers and the learned brahmanas present, the King approached and fell unconscious at the child’s feet, his hair and dress scattered.</p>
<p>When the King, breathing heavily, regained consciousness, his eyes were tearful, and he could not speak.</p>

<p>This is the way a conditioned soul condemns the supreme creator when he meets reverses.</p>

<p>My Lord, You may say that there is no law that a father must die in the lifetime of his son and that a son must be born in the lifetime of his father, since everyone lives and dies according to his own fruitive activity.</p>
<p>However, if fruitive activity is so strong that birth and death depend upon it, there is no need of a controller, or God.</p>
<p>Again, if You say that a controller is needed because the material energy does not have the power to act, one may answer that if the bonds of affection You have created are disturbed by fruitive action, no one will raise children with affection; instead, everyone will cruelly neglect his children.</p>
<p>Since You have cut the bonds of affection that compel a parent to raise his child, You appear inexperienced and unintelligent.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated in the Brahma-samhita, karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam: (Bs.5.54) one who has taken to Krsna consciousness, devotional service, is not affected by the results of karma.</p>
<p>In this verse, karma has been stressed on the basis of karma-mimamsa philosophy, which says that one must act according to his karma and that a supreme controller must give the results of karma.</p>
<p>The subtle laws of karma, which are controlled by the Supreme, cannot be understood by ordinary conditioned souls.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says that one who can understand Him and how He is acting, controlling everything by subtle laws, immediately becomes freed by His grace.</p>
<p>That is the statement of Brahma-samhita (karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam (Bs.5.54)).</p>
<p>One should take to devotional service without reservations and surrender everything to the supreme will of the Lord.</p>
<p>That will make one happy in this life and the next.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#615" id="615">6.15</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter, Angira Rsi, along with Narada, consoles Citraketu as far as possible.</p>
<p>Angira and Narada Rsi came to relieve the King from excessive lamentation by instructing him about the spiritual significance of life.</p>
<p>The great saints Angira and Narada explained that the relationship between father and son is not factual; it is simply a representation of the illusory energy.</p>
<p>The relationship did not exist before, nor will it stay in the future.</p>
<p>By the arrangement of time, the relationship exists only in the present.</p>
<p>One should not lament for temporary relationships.</p>
<p>The entire cosmic manifestation is temporary; although not unreal, it is not factual.</p>
<p>By the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything created in the material world is transient.</p>
<p>By a temporary arrangement, a father begets a child, or a living entity becomes the child of a so-called father.</p>
<p>This temporary arrangement is made by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Neither the father nor the son exists independently.</p>
<p>As the King listened to the great sages, he was relieved from his false lamentation, and then he inquired about their identity.</p>
<p>The great sages presented who they were and instructed that all sufferings are due to the bodily conception of life.</p>
<p>When one understands his spiritual identity and surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spiritual person, one becomes actually happy.</p>
<p>When one searches for happiness in matter, one must certainly lament for bodily relationships.</p>
<p>Self-realization means spiritual realization of one’s relationship with Krsna.</p>
<p>Such realization ends one’s miserable material life.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, what relationship does the dead body for which you lament have with you, and what relationship do you have with him? You may say that you are now related as father and son, but do you think this relationship existed before? Does it truly exist now? Will it continue in the future?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The instructions given by Narada and Angira Muni are the true spiritual instructions for the illusioned conditioned soul.</p>
<p>This world is temporary, but because of our previous karma we come here and accept bodies, creating temporary relationships in terms of society, friendship, love, nationality and community, which are all finished at death.</p>
<p>These temporary relationships did not exist in the past, nor will they exist in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore at the present moment the so-called relationships are illusions.</p>

<p>yatha—just as; prayanti—move apart; samyanti—come together; srotah-vegena—by the force of waves; balukah—the small particles of sand; samyujyante—they are united; viyujyante—they are separated; tatha—similarly; kalena—by time; dehinah—the living entities who have accepted material bodies.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King, as small particles of sand sometimes come together and are sometimes separated due to the force of the waves, the living entities who have accepted material bodies sometimes come together and are sometimes separated by the force of time.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The misunderstanding of the conditioned soul is the bodily conception of life.</p>
<p>The body is material, but within the body is the soul.</p>
<p>This is spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, one who is in ignorance, under the spell of material illusion, accepts the body to be the self.</p>
<p>He cannot understand that the body is matter.</p>
<p>Like small particles of sand, bodies come together and are separated by the force of time, and people falsely lament for unification and separation.</p>
<p>Unless one knows this, there is no question of happiness.</p>
<p>Therefore in Bhagavad-gita (2.13) this is the first instruction given by the Lord:</p>
<p>dehino ’smin yatha dehe</p>
<p>kaumaram yauvanam jara</p>
<p>tatha dehantara-praptir</p>
<p>dhiras tatra na muhyati</p>
<p>As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death.</p>
<p>The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change We are not the body; we are spiritual beings trapped in the body.</p>
<p>Our real interest lies in understanding this simple fact.</p>
<p>Then we can make further spiritual progress.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if we remain in the bodily conception of life, our miserable material existence will continue forever.</p>
<p>Political adjustments, social welfare work, medical assistance and the other programs we have manufactured for peace and happiness will never endure.</p>
<p>We shall have to undergo the sufferings of material life one after another.</p>
<p>Therefore material life is said to be duhkhalayam asasvatam (Bg.8.15); it is a reservoir of miserable conditions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When seeds are sown in the ground, they sometimes grow into plants and sometimes do not.</p>
<p>Sometimes the ground is not fertile, and the sowing of seeds is unproductive.</p>
<p>Similarly, sometimes a prospective father, being impelled by the potency of the Supreme Lord, can beget a child, but sometimes conception does not take place.</p>
<p>Therefore one should not lament over the artificial relationship of parenthood, which is ultimately controlled by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Citraketu was actually not destined to get a son.</p>
<p>Therefore although he married hundreds and thousands of wives, all of them proved barren, and he could not beget even one child.</p>
<p>When Angira Rsi came to see the King, the King requested the great sage to enable him to have at least one son.</p>
<p>Because of the blessing of Angira Rsi, a child was sent by the grace of maya, but the child was not to live for long.</p>
<p>Therefore in the beginning Angira Rsi told the King that he would beget a child who would cause jubilation and lamentation.</p>
<p>King Citraketu was not destined to get a child by providence, or the will of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Just as sterile grain cannot produce more grain, a sterile person, by the will of the Supreme Lord, cannot beget a child.</p>
<p>Sometimes a child is born even to an impotent father and sterile mother, and sometimes a potent father and fertile mother are childless.</p>
<p>Indeed, sometimes a child is born despite contraceptive methods, and therefore the parents kill the child in the womb.</p>
<p>In the present age, killing children in the womb has become a common practice.</p>
<p>Why? When contraceptive methods are taken, why don’t they act? Why is a child sometimes produced so that the father and mother have to kill it in the womb? We must conclude that our arrangement of so-called scientific knowledge cannot determine what will take place; what is enacted actually depends on the supreme will.</p>
<p>It is by the supreme will that we are situated in certain conditions in terms of family, community and personality.</p>
<p>These are all arrangements of the Supreme Lord according to our desires under the spell of maya, illusion.</p>
<p>In devotional life, therefore, one should not desire anything, since everything depends on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>(Madhya 19.167)</p>
<p>One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desire for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation.</p>
<p>That is called pure devotional service One should act only to develop Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>For everything else, one should fully depend upon the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>We should not create plans that will ultimately make us frustrated.</p>

<p>According to the Vaisnava philosophy, however, the present situation is not false but temporary.</p>
<p>It is like a dream.</p>
<p>A dream does not exist before one falls asleep, nor does it continue after one awakens.</p>
<p>The period for dreaming exists only between these two, and therefore it is false in the sense that it is impermanent.</p>
<p>Similarly, the entire material creation, including our own creation and those of others, is impermanent.</p>
<p>We do not lament for the situation in a dream before the dream takes place or after it is over, and so during the dream, or during a dreamlike situation, one should not accept it as factual and lament about it.</p>
<p>This is real knowledge.</p>

<p>anapekso ’pi balavat</p>
<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>bhutaih—by some living beings; bhutani—other living entities; bhuta-isah—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of everything; srjati—creates; avati—maintains; hanti—kills; ca—also; atma-srstaih—who are created by Him; asvatantraih—not independent; anapeksah—not interested (in creation); api—although; bala-vat—like a boy.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master and proprietor of everything, is certainly not interested in the temporary cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, just as a boy at the beach creates something in which he is not interested, the Lord, keeping everything under His control, causes creation, maintenance and annihilation.</p>
<p>He creates by engaging a father to beget a son, He maintains by engaging a government or king to see to the public’s welfare, and He annihilates through agents for killing, such as snakes.</p>
<p>The agents for creation, maintenance and annihilation have no independent potency, but because of the spell of the illusory energy, one thinks himself the creator, maintainer and annihilator.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>No one can independently create, maintain or annihilate.</p>
<p>Bhagavad-gita (3.27) therefore says:</p>
<p>prakrteh kriyamanani</p>
<p>gunaih karmani sarvasah</p>
<p>ahankara-vimudhatma</p>
<p>kartaham iti manyate</p>
<p>The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature Prakrti, material nature, as directed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, induces all living entities to create, maintain or annihilate according to the modes of nature.</p>
<p>But the living entity, without knowledge of the Supreme Person and His agent the material energy, thinks that he is the doer.</p>
<p>In fact, he is not at all the doer.</p>
<p>As an agent of the supreme doer, the Supreme Lord, one should abide by the Lord’s orders.</p>
<p>The present chaotic conditions of the world are due to the ignorance of leaders who forget that they have been appointed to act by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Because they have been appointed by the Lord, their duty is to consult the Lord and act accordingly.</p>
<p>The book for consultation is Bhagavad-gita, in which the Supreme Lord gives directions.</p>
<p>Therefore those who are engaged in creation, maintenance and annihilation should consult the Supreme Person, who has appointed them, and should act accordingly.</p>
<p>Then everyone will be satisfied, and there will be no disturbances.</p>

<p>dehena—by the body; dehinah—of the father possessing a material body; rajan—O King; dehat—from the body (of the mother); dehah—another body; abhijayate—takes birth; bijat—from one seed; eva—indeed; yatha—just as; bijam—another seed; dehi—a person who has accepted a material body; arthah—the material elements; iva—like; sasvatah—eternal.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As from one seed another seed is generated, O King, so from one body (the body of the father), through another body (the body of the mother), a third body is generated (the body of a son).</p>
<p>As the elements of the material body are eternal, the living entity who appears through these material elements is also eternal.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>From Bhagavad-gita we understand that there are two energies, namely the superior energy and inferior energy.</p>
<p>Inferior energy consists of the five gross and three subtle material elements.</p>
<p>The living entity who represents the superior energy, appears in different types of bodies through these elements by the manipulation or supervision of the material energy.</p>
<p>Actually both the material and spiritual energies—matter and spirit—exist eternally as potencies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>The potent entity is the Supreme Person.</p>
<p>Since the spiritual energy, the living being, who is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, desires to enjoy this material world, the Lord gives him a chance to accept different types of material bodies and enjoy or suffer in different material conditions.</p>
<p>Factually, the spiritual energy, the living entity who desires to enjoy material things, is manipulated by the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The so-called father and mother have nothing to do with the living entity.</p>
<p>As a result of his own choice and karma, the living being takes different bodies through the agency of so-called fathers and mothers.</p>

<p>Others are Romasa, Cyavana, Dattatreya, Asuri, Patanjali, the great sage Dhaumya who is like the head of the Vedas, the sage Pancasikha, Hiranyanabha, Kausalya, Srutadeva and Rtadhvaja.</p>
<p>You must certainly be among them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word jnana-hetavah is very significant because great personalities like those listed in these verses wander on the surface of the globe not to mislead the populace, but to distribute real knowledge.</p>
<p>Without this knowledge, human life is wasted.</p>
<p>The human form of life is meant for realization of one’s relationship with Krsna, or God.</p>
<p>One who lacks this knowledge is categorized among the animals.</p>
<p>The Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (7.15):</p>
<p>na mam duskrtino mudhah</p>
<p>prapadyante naradhamah</p>
<p>mayayapahrta-jnana</p>
<p>asuram bhavam asritah</p>
<p>Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest among mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion, and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons, do not surrender unto Me Ignorance is the bodily conception of life (yasyatma-buddhih kunape tri-dhatuke …sa eva go-kharah (SB 10.84.13)).</p>
<p>Practically everyone throughout the universe, especially on this planet, Bhurloka, thinks that there is no separate existence of the body and soul and therefore no need of self-realization.</p>
<p>But that is not a fact.</p>
<p>Therefore all the brahmanas listed here, being devotees, travel all over the world to awaken Krsna consciousness in the hearts of such foolish materialists.</p>
<p>The acaryas mentioned in these verses are described in the Mahabharata.</p>
<p>The word pancasikha is also important.</p>
<p>One who is liberated from the conceptions of annamaya, pranamaya, manomaya, vijnanamaya and anandamaya and who is perfectly aware of the subtle coverings of the soul is called pancasikha.</p>
<p>According to the statements of the Mahabharata (Santi-parva, Chapters 218–219), an acarya named Pancasikha took birth in the family of Maharaja Janaka, the ruler of Mithila.</p>
<p>The Sankhya philosophers accept Pancasikhacarya as one of them.</p>
<p>Real knowledge pertains to the living entity dwelling within the body.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of ignorance, the living entity identifies himself with the body and therefore feels pleasure and pain.</p>

<p>I am as foolish as a village animal like a pig or dog because I am merged in the darkness of ignorance.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is the way to receive knowledge.</p>
<p>One must submit oneself at the lotus feet of great personalities who can actually deliver transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>It is therefore said, tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam: (SB 11.3.21) One who is inquisitive to understand the highest goal and benefit of life must approach a bona fide spiritual master and surrender unto him Only one who is actually eager to receive knowledge to eradicate the darkness of ignorance is eligible to approach a guru, or spiritual master.</p>
<p>The guru should not be approached for material benefits.</p>
<p>One should not approach a guru just to cure some disease or receive some miraculous benefit.</p>
<p>This is not the way to approach the guru.</p>
<p>Tad-vijnanartham: one should approach the guru to understand the transcendental science of spiritual life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this age of Kali there are many bogus gurus who display magic to their disciples, and many foolish disciples want to see such magic for material benefits.</p>
<p>These disciples are not interested in pursuing spiritual life to save themselves from the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>It is said:</p>
<p>om ajnana-timirandhasya</p>
<p>jnananjana-salakaya</p>
<p>caksur unmilitam yena</p>
<p>tasmai sri-gurave namah</p>
<p>I was born in the darkest ignorance, and my spiritual master opened my eyes with the torch of knowledge.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto him This gives the definition of the guru.</p>
<p>Everyone is in the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore everyone needs to be enlightened with transcendental knowledge.</p>
<p>One who enlightens his disciple and saves him from rotting in the darkness of ignorance in this material world is a true guru.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear King, you are an advanced devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>To be absorbed in lamentation for the loss of something material is unsuitable for a person like you.</p>
<p>Therefore we have both come to relieve you from this false lamentation, which is due to your being merged in the darkness of ignorance.</p>
<p>For those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge to be affected by material loss and gain is not at all desirable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Several words in this verse are very important.</p>
<p>The word maha-purusa refers to advanced devotees and also to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Maha means the supreme and purusa means person One who always engages in the service of the Supreme Lord is called maha-paurusika.</p>
<p>Sukadeva Gosvami and Maharaja Pariksit are sometimes addressed as maha-paurusika.</p>
<p>A devotee should always aspire to engage in the service of advanced devotees.</p>
<p>As Srila Narottama dasa Thakura has sung:</p>
<p>tandera carana sevi bhakta-sane vasa</p>
<p>janame janame haya, ei abhilasa</p>
<p>A devotee should always aspire to live in the association of advanced devotees and engage in the service of the Lord through the parampara system.</p>
<p>One should serve the mission of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu through the instructions of the great Gosvamis of Vrndavana.</p>
<p>This is called tandera carana sevi.</p>
<p>While serving the lotus feet of the Gosvamis, one should live in the association of devotees (bhakta-sane vasa).</p>
<p>This is the business of a devotee.</p>
<p>A devotee should not aspire for material profit or lament for material loss.</p>
<p>When Angira Rsi and Narada saw that Maharaja Citraketu, an advanced devotee, had fallen in the darkness of ignorance and was lamenting for the material body of his son, by their causeless mercy they came to advise him so that he could be saved from this ignorance.</p>
<p>Another significant word is brahmanya.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is sometimes addressed by the prayer namo brahmanya-devaya, which offers obeisances unto the Lord because He is served by the devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse states, brahmanyo bhagavad-bhakto navasaditum arhasi.</p>
<p>This is the symptom of an advanced devotee.</p>
<p>Brahma-bhutah prasannatma (Bg.18.54).</p>
<p>For a devotee—an advanced, self-realized soul—there is no cause for material jubilation or lamentation.</p>
<p>He is always transcendental to conditional life.</p>

<p>This verse describes the entanglement of material existence.</p>
<p>In material existence, the living entity possesses many things—the material body, children, wife and so on (dehapatya-kalatradisu).</p>
<p>One may think that these will give him protection, but that is impossible.</p>
<p>In spite of all these possessions, the spirit soul has to give up his present situation and accept another.</p>
<p>The next situation may be unfavorable, but even if it is favorable, one must give it up and again accept another body.</p>
<p>In this way, one’s tribulation in material existence continues.</p>

<p>Everything material is a mental concoction because it is sometimes visible and sometimes not.</p>
<p>At night when we dream of tigers and snakes, they are not actually present, but we are afraid because we are affected by what we envision in our dreams.</p>
<p>Everything material is like a dream because it actually has no permanent existence.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura writes as follows in his commentary: arthena vyaghra-sarpadina vinaiva drsyamanah svapnadi-bhange sati na drsyante tad evam daradayo ’vastava-vastu-bhutah svapnadayo ’vastu-bhutas ca sarve manobhavah mano-vasana janyatvan manobhavah.</p>
<p>At night one dreams of tigers and snakes, and while dreaming he actually sees them, but as soon as the dream is broken they no longer exist.</p>
<p>Similarly, the material world is a creation of our mental concoctions.</p>
<p>We have come to this material world to enjoy material resources, and by mental concoction we discover many, many objects of enjoyment because our minds are absorbed in material things.</p>
<p>This is why we receive various bodies.</p>
<p>According to our mental concoctions we work in various ways, desiring various achievements, and by nature and the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (karmana-daiva-netrena) we get the advantages we desire.</p>
<p>Thus we become more and more involved with material concoctions.</p>
<p>This is the reason for our suffering in the material world.</p>
<p>By one kind of activity we create another, and they are all products of our mental concoctions.</p>

<p>ayam—this; hi—certainly; dehinah—of the living entity; dehah—body; dravya-jnana-kriya-atmakah—consisting of the material elements, the senses for acquiring knowledge, and the acting senses; dehinah—of the living entity; vividha—various; klesa—sufferings; santapa—and of pains; krt—the cause; udahrtah—is declared.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The living entity in the bodily conception of life is absorbed in the body, which is a combination of the physical elements, the five senses for gathering knowledge, and the five senses of action, along with the mind.</p>
<p>Through the mind the living entity suffers three kinds of tribulations—adhibhautika, adhidaivika and adhyatmika.</p>
<p>Therefore this body is a source of all miseries.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In the Fifth Canto (5.5.4), while instructing his sons, Rsabhadeva said, asann api klesada asa dehah: the body, although temporary, is the cause of all the miseries of material existence.</p>
<p>As already discussed in the previous verse, the entire material creation is based on mental concoction.</p>
<p>The mind sometimes induces us to think that if we purchase an automobile we can enjoy the physical elements, such as earth, water, air and fire, combined in forms of iron, plastic, petrol and so on.</p>
<p>Working with the five material elements (panca-bhutas), as well as with our five knowledge-gathering senses like the eyes, ears and tongue and our five active senses like the hands and legs, we become involved in the material condition.</p>
<p>Thus we are subjected to the tribulations known as adhyatmika, adhidaivika and adhibhautika.</p>
<p>The mind is the center because the mind creates all these things.</p>
<p>As soon as the material object is struck, however, the mind is affected, and we suffer.</p>
<p>For example, with the material elements, the working senses and the knowledge-gathering senses we create a very nice car, and when the car is accidentally smashed in a collision, the mind suffers, and through the mind the living entity suffers.</p>
<p>The fact is that the living entity, while concocting with the mind, creates the material condition.</p>
<p>Because matter is destructible, through the material condition the living entity suffers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the living entity is detached from all material conditions.</p>
<p>When one comes to the Brahman platform, the platform of spiritual life, fully understanding that he is a spiritual soul (aham brahmasmi), he is no longer affected by lamentation or hankering.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (18.54):</p>
<p>brahma-bhutah prasannatma</p>
<p>na socati na kanksati</p>
<p>One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman and becomes fully joyful.</p>
<p>He never laments nor desires to have anything Elsewhere in Bhagavad-gita (15.7) the Lord says:</p>
<p>mamaivamso jiva-loke</p>
<p>jiva-bhutah sanatanah</p>
<p>manah-sasthanindriyani</p>
<p>prakrti-sthani karsati</p>
<p>The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts.</p>
<p>Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind The living entity is actually part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is unaffected by material conditions, but because the mind (manah) is affected, the senses are affected, and the living entity struggles for existence within this material world.</p>

<p>Try to understand your real position in this way, and then you will be able to give up your unnecessary attachment.</p>
<p>You will also be able to give up the belief that this material world, or anything not directly in touch with service to Krsna, is eternal.</p>
<p>Thus you will obtain peace.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is factually endeavoring to bring human society to a sober condition.</p>
<p>Because of a misdirected civilization, people are jumping in materialistic life like cats and dogs, performing all sorts of abominable, sinful actions and becoming increasingly entangled.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement includes self-realization because one is first directed by Lord Krsna to understand that one is not the body but the owner of the body.</p>
<p>When one understands this simple fact, he can direct himself toward the goal of life.</p>
<p>Because people are not educated in terms of the goal of life, they are working like madmen and becoming more and more attached to the material atmosphere.</p>
<p>The misguided man accepts the material condition as everlasting.</p>
<p>One must give up his faith in material things and give up attachment for them.</p>
<p>Then one will be sober and peaceful.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-15" id="summary-15">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#616-1" id="616-1">6.16</a></h3>
<p>As related in this chapter, Citraketu was able to talk with his dead son and hear from him the truth of life.</p>
<p>When Citraketu was appeased, the great sage Narada gave him a mantra, and by chanting this mantra Citraketu found shelter at the lotus feet of Sankarsana.</p>
<p>The living entity is eternal.</p>
<p>Thus he has neither birth nor death (na hanyate hanyamane sarire (Bg.2.20)).</p>
<p>According to the reactions of one’s fruitive activities, one takes birth in various species of life among the birds, beasts, trees, human beings, demigods and so on, thus rotating through various bodies.</p>
<p>For a certain period of time, one receives a particular type of body as a son or father in a false relationship.</p>
<p>All our relationships in this material world with friends, relatives or enemies consist of duality, in which one feels happy and distressed on the basis of illusion.</p>
<p>The living entity is actually a spiritual soul who is part and parcel of God and has nothing to do with relationships in the world of duality.</p>
<p>Therefore Narada Muni advised Citraketu not to lament for his so-called dead son.</p>
<p>After hearing instructions from their dead child, Citraketu and his wife could understand that all relationships in this material world are causes of misery.</p>
<p>The queens who had administered poison to the son of Krtadyuti were very much ashamed.</p>
<p>They atoned for the sinful act of killing a child and gave up their aspiration to have sons.</p>
<p>Thereafter.</p>
<p>Narada Muni chanted prayers to Narayana, who exists as catur-vyuha, and instructed Citraketu about the Supreme Lord, who creates, maintains and annihilates everything and who is the master of the material nature.</p>
<p>After instructing King Citraketu in this way, he returned to Brahmaloka.</p>
<p>These instructions about the Absolute Truth are called the maha-vidya.</p>
<p>After being initiated by Narada Muni, King Citraketu chanted the maha-vidya, and after one week he attained the presence of Lord Sankarsana, who was surrounded by the four Kumaras.</p>
<p>The Lord was nicely dressed in bluish garments, with a helmet and ornaments of gold.</p>
<p>His face appeared very happy.</p>
<p>In the presence of Lord Sankarsana, Citraketu offered his obeisances and began to offer prayers.</p>
<p>In his prayers, Citraketu said that millions of universes rest in the pores of Sankarsana, who is limitless, having no beginning and end.</p>
<p>The Lord is well known to the devotees for His eternity.</p>
<p>The difference between worshiping the Lord and worshiping the demigods is that the worshiper of the Lord also becomes eternal, whereas whatever benedictions one can get from the demigods are impermanent.</p>
<p>Unless one becomes a devotee, one cannot understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>After Citraketu finished his prayers, the unlimited Supreme Lord explained knowledge of Himself to Citraketu.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>By the mystic power of Narada Muni, the living entity reentered his dead body for a short time and spoke in reply to Narada Muni’s request.</p>
<p>He said: According to the results of my fruitive activities, I, the living being, transmigrate from one body to another, sometimes going to the species of the demigods, sometimes to the species of lower animals, sometimes among the vegetables, and sometimes to the human species.</p>
<p>Therefore, in which birth were these my mother and father? No one is actually my mother and father.</p>
<p>How can I accept these two people as my parents?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here it is made clear that the living being enters a material body that is like a machine created by the five gross elements of material nature (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the three subtle elements (mind, intelligence and ego).</p>
<p>As confirmed in Bhagavad-gita, there are two separate identities, called the inferior and superior natures, which both belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>According to the results of a living entity’s fruitive actions, he is forced to enter the material elements in different types of bodies.</p>
<p>This time the living entity was supposed to have been the son of Maharaja Citraketu and Queen Krtadyuti because according to the laws of nature he had entered a body made by the King and Queen.</p>
<p>Actually, however, he was not their son.</p>
<p>The living entity is the son of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because he wants to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Lord gives him a chance to enter various bodies.</p>
<p>The living entity has no true relationship with the material body he gets from his material father and mother.</p>
<p>He is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but he is allowed to go through different bodies.</p>
<p>The body created by the so-called father and mother actually has nothing to do with its so-called creators.</p>
<p>Therefore the living entity flatly denied that Maharaja Citraketu and his wife were his father and mother.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this material world, which advances like a river that carries away the living entity, all people become friends, relatives and enemies in due course of time.</p>
<p>They also act neutrally, they mediate, they despise one another, and they act in many other relationships.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite these various transactions, no one is permanently related.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is our practical experience in this material world that the same person who is one’s friend today becomes one’s enemy tomorrow.</p>
<p>Our relationships as friends or enemies, family men or outsiders, are actually the results of our different dealings.</p>
<p>Citraketu Maharaja was lamenting for his son, who was now dead, but he could have considered the situation otherwise This living entity he could have thought, was my enemy in my last life, and now, having appeared as my son, he is prematurely leaving just to give me pain and agony Why should he not consider his dead son his former enemy and instead of lamenting be jubilant because of an enemy’s death? As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.27), prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah: factually everything is happening because of our association with the modes of material nature.</p>
<p>Therefore one who is my friend today in association with the mode of goodness may be my enemy tomorrow in association with the modes of passion and ignorance.</p>
<p>As the modes of material nature work, in illusion we accept others as friends, enemies, sons or fathers in terms of the reactions of different dealings under different conditions.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Just as gold and other commodities are continually transferred from one place to another in due course of purchase and sale, so the living entity, as a result of his fruitive activities, wanders throughout the entire universe, being injected into various bodies in different species of life by one kind of father after another.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It has already been explained that Citraketu’s son was his enemy in a past life and had now appeared as his son just to give him more severe pain.</p>
<p>Indeed, the untimely death of the son caused severe lamentation for the father.</p>
<p>One may put forward the argument, If the King’s son was his enemy, how could the King have so much affection for him In answer, the example is given that when someone’s wealth falls into the bands of his enemy, the money becomes the enemy’s friend.</p>
<p>Then the enemy can use it for his own purposes.</p>
<p>Indeed, he can even use it to harm its previous owner.</p>
<p>Therefore the money belongs neither to the one party nor to the other.</p>
<p>The money is always money, but in different situations it can be used as an enemy or a friend.</p>
<p>As explained in Bhagavad-gita, it is not by any father or mother that the living entity is given his birth.</p>
<p>The living entity is a completely separate identity from the so-called father and mother.</p>
<p>By the laws of nature, the living entity is forced to enter the semen of a father and be injected into the womb of the mother.</p>
<p>He is not in control of selecting what kind of father he will accept prakrteh kriyamanani: the laws of nature force him to go to different fathers and mothers, just like a consumer commodity that is purchased and sold.</p>
<p>Therefore the so-called relationship of father and son is an arrangement of prakrti, or nature.</p>
<p>It has no meaning, and therefore it is called illusion.</p>
<p>The same living entity sometimes takes shelter of an animal father and mother and sometimes a human father and mother.</p>
<p>Sometimes he accepts a father and mother among the birds, and sometimes he accepts a demigod father and mother.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu therefore says:</p>
<p>brahmanda bhramite kona bhagyavan jiva</p>
<p>guru-krsna-prasade paya bhakti-lata-bija</p>
<p>Harassed life after life by the laws of nature, the living entity wanders throughout the entire universe in different planets and different species of life.</p>
<p>Somehow or other, if he is fortunate enough, he comes in touch with a devotee who reforms his entire life.</p>
<p>Then the living entity goes back home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore it is said:</p>
<p>janame janame sabe pita mata paya</p>
<p>krsna guru nahi mile baja hari ei</p>
<p>In the transmigration of the soul through different bodies, everyone, in every form of life—be it human, animal, tree or demigod—gets a father and mother.</p>
<p>This is not very difficult.</p>
<p>The difficulty is to obtain a bona fide spiritual master and Krsna.</p>
<p>Therefore the duty of a human being is to capture the opportunity to come in touch with Krsna’s representative, the bona fide spiritual master.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the spiritual master, the spiritual father, one can return home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>As long as the animal is in his possession he certainly has an affinity for it, but as soon as the animal is sold, the affinity is lost.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the fact that the soul transmigrates from one body to another, even in this life the relationships between living entities are impermanent, as exemplified in this verse.</p>
<p>The son of Citraketu was named Harsasoka, or jubilation and lamentation The living entity is certainly eternal, but because he is covered by a temporary dress, the body, his eternity is not observed.</p>
<p>Dehino ’smin yatha dehe kaumaram yauvanam jara: (Bg.2.13) The embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age Thus the bodily dress is impermanent.</p>
<p>The living entity, however, is permanent.</p>
<p>As an animal is transferred from one owner to another, the living entity who was the son of Citraketu lived as his son for some time, but as soon as he was transferred to another body, the affectionate relationship was broken.</p>
<p>As stated in the example given in the previous verse, when one has a commodity in his hands he considers it his, but as soon as it is transferred it becomes someone else’s commodity.</p>
<p>Then one no longer has a relationship with it; he has no affection for it, nor does he lament for it.</p>

<p>After he dies, however, the relationship is finished.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, one should not be falsely involved with jubilation and lamentation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When the living entity lives within the material body, he falsely thinks that he is the body, although actually he is not.</p>
<p>His relationship with his body and his so-called father and mother are false, illusory conceptions.</p>
<p>These illusions continue as long as one is not enlightened about the situation of the living entity.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>esah—this living entity; nityah—eternal; avyayah—imperishable; suksmah—very, very fine (not seen by the material eyes); esah—this living entity; sarva-asrayah—the cause of different types of bodies; sva-drk—self-effulgent; atma-maya-gunaih—by the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s modes of material nature; visvam—this material world; atmanam—himself; srjate—appears; prabhuh—the master.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The living entity is eternal and imperishable because he actually has no beginning and no end.</p>
<p>He never takes birth or dies.</p>
<p>He is the basic principle of all types of bodies, yet he does not belong to the bodily category.</p>
<p>The living being is so sublime that he is equal in quality to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, because he is extremely small, he is prone to be illusioned by the external energy, and thus he creates various bodies for himself according to his different desires.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the philosophy of acintya-bhedabheda—simultaneous oneness and difference—is described.</p>
<p>The living entity is eternal (nitya) like the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the difference is that the Supreme Lord is the greatest, no one being equal to or greater than Him, whereas the living entity is suksma, or extremely small.</p>
<p>The sastra describes that the magnitude of the living entity is one ten-thousandth the size of the tip of a hair.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is all-pervading (andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham).</p>
<p>Relatively, if the living entity is accepted as the smallest, there should naturally be inquiry about the greatest.</p>
<p>The greatest is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the smallest is the living entity.</p>
<p>Another peculiar characteristic of the jiva is that he becomes covered by maya.</p>
<p>Atmamaya-gunaih: he is prone to being covered by the Supreme Lord’s illusory energy.</p>
<p>The living entity is responsible for his conditional life in the material world, and therefore he is described as prabhu (the maste).</p>
<p>If he likes he can come to this material world, and if he likes he can return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Because he wanted to enjoy this material world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead gave him a material body through the agency of the material energy.</p>
<p>As the Lord Himself says in Bhagavad-gita (18.61):</p>
<p>isvarah sarva-bhutanam</p>
<p>hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati</p>
<p>bhramayan sarva-bhutani</p>
<p>yantrarudhani mayaya</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy The Supreme Lord gives the living entity a chance to enjoy in this material world as he desires, but He openly expresses His own desire that the living entity give up all material aspirations, fully surrender unto Him and return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The living entity is the smallest (suksma).</p>
<p>Jiva Gosvami says in this connection that the living entity within the body is extremely difficult for materialistic scientists to find, although we understand from authorities that the living entity is within the body.</p>
<p>The body is different from the living entity.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>For this living entity, no one is dear, nor is anyone unfavorable.</p>
<p>He makes no distinction between that which is his own and that which belongs to anyone else.</p>
<p>He is one without a second; in other words, he is not affected by friends and enemies, well-wishers or mischief-mongers.</p>
<p>He is only an observer, a witness, of the different qualities of men.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As explained in the previous verse, the living entity has the same qualities as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he has them in minute quantities because he is a small particle (suksma) whereas the Supreme Lord is all-pervading and great.</p>
<p>For the Supreme Lord there are no friends, enemies or relatives, for He is completely free from all the disqualifications of ignorance that characterize the conditioned souls.</p>
<p>On the other hand, He is extremely kind and favorable to His devotees, and He is not at all satisfied with persons who are envious of His devotees.</p>
<p>As the Lord Himself confirms in Bhagavad-gita (9.29):</p>
<p>samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu</p>
<p>na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah</p>
<p>ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya</p>
<p>mayi te tesu capy aham</p>
<p>I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone.</p>
<p>I am equal to all.</p>
<p>But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him The Supreme Lord has no enemy or friend, but He is inclined toward a devotee who always engages in His devotional service.</p>
<p>Gita (16.19) the Lord says:</p>
<p>tan aham dvisatah kruran</p>
<p>samsaresu naradhaman</p>
<p>ksipamy ajasram asubhan</p>
<p>asurisv eva yonisu</p>
<p>Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life The Lord is extremely antagonistic toward those who are envious of His devotees.</p>
<p>To protect His devotees, the Lord sometimes has to kill their enemies.</p>
<p>For example, to protect Prahlada Maharaja, the Lord had to kill his enemy Hiranyakasipu, although Hiranyakasipu attained salvation because of being killed by the Lord.</p>
<p>Since the Lord is the witness of everyone’s activities, He witnesses the actions of the enemies of His devotees, and He is inclined to punish them.</p>
<p>In other cases, however, He simply witnesses what the living entities do and gives the results of one’s sinful or pious actions.</p>

<p>na—not; adatte—accepts; atma—the Supreme Lord; hi—indeed; gunam—happiness; na—not; dosam—unhappiness; na—nor; kriya-phalam—the result of any fruitive activity; udasina-vat—exactly like a neutral man; asinah—sitting (in the core of the heart); para-avara-drk—seeing the cause and effect; isvarah—the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Lord (atma), the creator of cause and effect, does not accept the happiness and distress that result from fruitive actions.</p>
<p>He is completely independent of having to accept a material body, and because He has no material body, He is always neutral.</p>
<p>The living entities, being part and parcel of the Lord, possess His qualities in a minute quantity.</p>
<p>Therefore one should not be affected by lamentation.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The conditioned soul has friends and enemies.</p>
<p>He is affected by the good qualities and the faults of his position.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord, however, is always transcendental.</p>
<p>Because He is the isvara, the supreme controller, He is not affected by duality.</p>
<p>It may therefore be said that He sits in the core of everyone’s heart as the neutral witness of the causes and effects of one’s activities, good and bad.</p>
<p>We should also understand that udasina, neutral, does not mean that He takes no action.</p>
<p>Rather, it means that He is not personally affected.</p>
<p>For example, a court judge is neutral when two opposing parties appear before him, but he still takes action as the case warrants.</p>
<p>To become completely neutral, indifferent, to material activities, we should simply seek shelter at the lotus feet of the supreme neutral person.</p>
<p>Maharaja Citraketu was advised that remaining neutral in such trying circumstances as the death of one’s son is impossible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, since the Lord knows how to adjust everything, the best course is to depend upon Him and do one’s duty in devotional service to the Lord.</p>
<p>In all circumstances, one should be undisturbed by duality.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.47):</p>
<p>karmany evadhikaras te</p>
<p>ma phalesu kadacana</p>
<p>ma karma-phala-hetur bhur</p>
<p>ma te sango ’stv akarmani</p>
<p>You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action.</p>
<p>Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty One should execute one’s devotional duty, and for the results of one’s actions one should depend upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>Queen Krtyadyuti’s co-wives, who had poisoned the child, were very much ashamed, and they lost all their bodily luster.</p>
<p>While lamenting, O King, they remembered the instructions of Angira and gave up their ambition to bear children.</p>
<p>Following the directions of the brahmanas, they went to the bank of the Yamuna, where they bathed and atoned for their sinful activities.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the word bala-hatya-hata-prabhah is to be particularly noted.</p>
<p>The practice of killing children has existed in human society for a long time—since time immemorial—but in the days of yore it was very rarely performed.</p>
<p>At the present moment, however, in this age of Kali, abortion—killing of the child within the womb—has become very common, and sometimes a child is even killed after birth.</p>
<p>If a woman performs such an abominable act, she gradually loses all her bodily luster (bala-hatya-hata-prabhah).</p>
<p>It is also to be noted that the ladies who had committed the sinful act of administering poison to the child were very much ashamed, and according to the directions of the brahmanas, they had to undergo atonement for killing the child.</p>
<p>Any woman who has ever performed such an infamously sinful act must atone for it, but no one now is doing that.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, the women responsible must suffer in this life and the next.</p>
<p>Those who are sincere souls, after hearing this incident, should refrain from such child-killing and should atone for their sinful activities by taking to Krsna consciousness very seriously.</p>
<p>If one chants the Hare Krsna maha-mantra without offenses, all of one’s sinful actions are surely atoned for immediately, but one should not commit such deeds again, for that is an offense.</p>

<p>O ultimate truth, one without a second, You are realized as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan and are therefore the reservoir of all knowledge.</p>
<p>I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita Krsna says that He is pranavah sama-vedesu, the syllable om in the Vedic mantras.</p>
<p>In transcendental knowledge, the Lord is addressed as pranava, omkara, which is a symbolic representation of the Lord in sound.</p>
<p>Om namo bhagavate vasudevaya.</p>
<p>Vasudeva, who is an expansion of Narayana, expands Himself as Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarsana.</p>
<p>From Sankarsana comes a second Narayana expansion, and from this Narayana come further expansions of Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Sankarsana and Aniruddha.</p>
<p>The Sankarsana in this group is the original cause of the three purusas, namely Karanodakasayi Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu and Ksirodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Ksirodakasayi Visnu is situated in every universe in a special planet called Svetadvipa.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhita: andantara-stha.</p>
<p>The word anda means this universe.</p>
<p>Within this universe is a planet called Svetadvipa, where Ksirodakasayi Visnu is situated.</p>
<p>From Him come all the incarnations within this universe.</p>
<p>As confirmed in the Brahma-samhita, all these forms of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are advaita, nondifferent, and they are also acyuta, infallible; they do not fall down like the conditioned souls.</p>
<p>The ordinary living entity is prone to falling into the clutches of maya, but the Supreme Lord in His different incarnations and forms is acyuta, infallible.</p>
<p>Therefore His body is different from the material body possessed by the conditioned soul.</p>
<p>The word matra is explained in the Medini dictionary as follows: matra karna-vibhusayam vitte mane paricchade.</p>
<p>The word matra, in its different imports, is used to indicate the decoration of the ear, possession, respect, and the possession of a covering.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (2.14):</p>
<p>matra-sparsas tu kaunteya</p>
<p>sitosna-sukha-duhkha-dah</p>
<p>agamapayino ’nityas</p>
<p>tams titiksasva bharata</p>
<p>O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons.</p>
<p>They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed In the conditioned state of life, the body is used as our dress, and as one needs different dresses during the summer and winter, we conditioned souls are changing bodies according to our desires.</p>
<p>However, because the body of the Supreme Lord is full of knowledge, it needs no covering.</p>
<p>The idea that Krsna’s body is like ours—in other words, that His body and soul are different—is a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>There are no such differences for Krsna, because His body is full of knowledge.</p>
<p>Here we receive material bodies because of a lack of knowledge, but because Krsna, Vasudeva, is full of knowledge, there is no difference between His body and His soul.</p>
<p>Krsna remembers what He said forty million years ago to the sun-god, but an ordinary being cannot remember what he said the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>This is the difference between Krsna’s body and our body.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is addressed as vijnana-matraya paramananda-murtaye.</p>
<p>Because the Lord’s body is full of knowledge, He always enjoys transcendental bliss.</p>
<p>Indeed, His very form is paramananda.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in the Vedanta-sutra: anandamayo’bhyasat.</p>
<p>By nature the Lord is anandamaya.</p>
<p>Whenever we see Krsna, He is always full of ananda in all circumstances.</p>
<p>No one can make Him morose.</p>
<p>Atmaramaya: He does not need to search for external enjoyment, because He is self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Santaya: He has no anxiety.</p>
<p>One who has to seek pleasure from other sources is always full of anxiety.</p>
<p>Karmis, jnanis and yogis are full of anxiety because they want something, but a devotee does not want anything; he is simply satisfied in the service of the Lord, who is fully blissful.</p>
<p>Nivrtta-dvaita-drstaye: in our conditioned life our bodies have different parts, but although Krsna apparently has different bodily parts, no part of His body is different from any other part.</p>
<p>Krsna can see with His eyes, and Krsna can see without His eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore in the Svetasvatara Upanisad it is said, pasyaty acaksuh.</p>
<p>He can see with His hands and legs.</p>
<p>He does not need a particular bodily part to perform a particular action.</p>
<p>Angani yasya sakalendriya-vrttimanti: He can do anything He desires with any part of His body, and therefore He is called almighty.</p>

<p>You are the supreme controller of the senses, and Your expansions of form are unlimited.</p>
<p>You are the greatest, and therefore I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This verse analytically differentiates the living entity from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The form of the Lord and the form of the conditioned soul are different because the Lord is always blissful whereas the conditioned soul is always under the threefold miseries of the material world.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha (Bs.5.1).</p>
<p>He derives ananda, bliss, from His own self.</p>
<p>The Lord’s body is transcendental, spiritual, but because the conditioned soul has a material body, he has many bodily and mental troubles.</p>
<p>The conditioned soul is always perturbed by attachment and detachment, whereas the Supreme Lord is always free from such dualities.</p>
<p>The Lord is the supreme master of all the senses, whereas the conditioned soul is controlled by the senses.</p>
<p>The Lord is the greatest, whereas the living entity is the smallest.</p>
<p>The living entity is conditioned by the waves of material nature, but the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all actions and reactions.</p>
<p>The expansions of the Supreme Lord’s body are innumerable (advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam (Bs.5.33)), but the conditioned soul is limited to only one form.</p>
<p>From history we learn that a conditioned soul, by mystic power, can sometimes expand into eight forms, but the Lord’s bodily expansions are unlimited.</p>
<p>This means that the bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead have no beginning and no end, unlike the bodies of the living entities.</p>

<p>The words and mind of the conditioned soul cannot approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for material names and forms are not applicable to the Lord, who is entirely spiritual, beyond the conception of gross and subtle forms.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As iron has the power to burn when made red-hot in the association of fire, so the body, senses, living force, mind and intelligence, although merely lumps of matter, can function in their activities when infused with a particle of consciousness by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As iron cannot burn unless heated by fire, the bodily senses cannot act unless favored by the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Red-hot iron can burn, but it cannot burn the original fire.</p>
<p>Therefore the consciousness of the small particle of Brahman is fully dependent on the power of the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita the Lord says, mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: (Bg.15.15) From Me the conditioned soul receives memory, knowledge and forgetfulness The power for activities comes from the Supreme Lord, and when the Lord withdraws this power, the conditioned soul no longer has energy with which to act through his various senses.</p>
<p>The body includes five knowledge-acquiring senses, five active senses and the mind, but actually these are merely lumps of matter.</p>
<p>For example, the brain is nothing but matter, but when electrified by the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the brain can act, just as iron can burn when made red-hot by the influence of fire.</p>
<p>The brain can act while we are awake or even while we are dreaming, but when we are fast asleep or unconscious the brain is inactive.</p>
<p>Since the brain is a lump of matter, it does not have independent power with which to act.</p>
<p>It can act only when favored by the influence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is Brahman or Parabrahman.</p>
<p>This is the way to understand how the Supreme Brahman, Krsna, is present everywhere, just as the sunshine is present because of the sun-god in the sun globe.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is called Hrsikesa; He is the only conductor of the senses.</p>
<p>Unless empowered by His energy, our senses cannot act.</p>
<p>In other words, He is the only seer, the only worker, the only listener, and the only active principle or supreme controller.</p>

<p>You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, complete in six opulences.</p>
<p>You are the supreme person mentioned in the Purusa-sukta prayers.</p>
<p>You are the most perfect, self-realized master of all mystic power.</p>
<p>Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said that the Absolute Truth is one, but is manifested in different features as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan.</p>
<p>The previous verses described the Brahman and Paramatma features of the Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>Now this prayer is offered in bhakti-yoga to the Absolute Supreme Person.</p>
<p>The words used in this regard are sakala-satvata-parivrdha.</p>
<p>The word satvata means devotees and sakala means all together The devotees, who also have lotus feet, serve the lotus feet of the Lord with their lotus hands.</p>
<p>The devotees may sometimes not be competent to serve the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore the Lord is addressed as parama-paramesthin.</p>
<p>He is the Supreme Person, yet He is very kind to the devotees.</p>
<p>No one is competent to serve the Lord, but even if a devotee is not competent, the merciful Lord accepts the humble attempt of the devotee.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Sukadeva Gosvami continued: Narada, having become the spiritual master of Citraketu, instructed him fully in this prayer because Citraketu was fully surrendered.</p>
<p>O King Pariksit, Narada then left with the great sage Angira for the topmost planet, known as Brahmaloka.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Angira had first come to visit King Citraketu, he did not bring Narada with him.</p>
<p>However, after the death of Citraketu’s son, Angira brought Narada to instruct King Citraketu about bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>The difference was that in the beginning Citraketu was not in a temperament of renunciation, but after the death of his son, when he was overwhelmed by his great plight, he was awakened to the platform of renunciation by instructions regarding the falsity of this material world and material possessions.</p>
<p>It is only at this stage that bhakti-yoga can be instructed.</p>
<p>As long as one is attached to material enjoyment, bhakti-yoga cannot be understood.</p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (2.44):</p>
<p>bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam</p>
<p>tayapahrta-cetasam</p>
<p>vyavasayatmika buddhih</p>
<p>samadhau na vidhiyate</p>
<p>In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination of devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place As long as one is very much attached to material enjoyment, one cannot concentrate his mind on the subject matter of devotional service.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is progressing successfully in the Western countries at the present moment because the youth in the West have reached the stage of vairagya, or renunciation.</p>
<p>They are practically disgusted with material pleasure from material sources, and this has resulted in a population of hippies throughout the Western countries.</p>
<p>Now if these young people are instructed about bhakti-yoga, Krsna consciousness, the instructions will certainly be effective.</p>
<p>As soon as Citraketu understood the philosophy of vairagya-vidya, the knowledge of renunciation, he could understand the process of bhakti-yoga.</p>
<p>In this regard Srila Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya has said, vairagya-vidya-nija-bhakti-yoga (Cc.Madya 6.254).</p>
<p>Vairagya-vidya and bhakti-yoga are parallel lines.</p>
<p>One is essential for understanding the other.</p>
<p>It is also said, bhaktih paresanubhavo viraktir anyatra ca (Bhag.11.2.42).</p>
<p>Advancement in devotional service, or Krsna consciousness, is characterized by increasing renunciation of material enjoyment.</p>
<p>Narada Muni is the father of devotional service, and therefore, just to bestow causeless mercy upon King Citraketu, Angira brought Narada Muni to instruct the King.</p>
<p>These instructions were extremely effective.</p>
<p>Anyone who follows in the footsteps of Narada Muni is certainly a pure devotee.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O King Pariksit, after only one week of repeatedly practicing the mantra received from the spiritual master, Citraketu achieved the rule of the planet of the Vidyadharas as an intermediate product of his spiritual advancement in knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If a devotee, after being initiated, adheres rigidly to the instructions of the spiritual master, he is naturally endowed with the material opulences of vidyadhara-adhipatyam and similar posts as by-products.</p>
<p>A devotee need not practice yoga, karma or jnana to achieve a successful result.</p>
<p>Devotional service alone is competent to award a devotee all material power.</p>
<p>A pure devotee, however, is never attached to material power, although he gets it very easily without personal endeavor.</p>
<p>Citraketu received this side benefit of his devotional service, which he rigidly performed in accordance with the instructions of Narada.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thereafter, within a very few days, by the influence of the mantra that Citraketu had practiced, his mind became increasingly enlightened in spiritual progress, and he attained shelter at the lotus feet of Anantadeva.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A devotee’s ultimate achievement is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord in any one of the planets in the spiritual sky.</p>
<p>As a result of rigid execution of devotional service, a devotee receives all material opulences if these are required; otherwise, the devotee is not interested in material opulences, nor does the Supreme Lord award them.</p>
<p>When a devotee is actually engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, his apparently material opulences are not material; they are all spiritual.</p>
<p>For example, if a devotee spends money to construct a beautiful and costly temple, the construction is not material but spiritual (nirbandhah krsna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate).</p>
<p>A devotee’s mind is never diverted to the material side of the temple.</p>
<p>The bricks, stone and wood used in the construction of the temple are spiritual, just as the Deity, although made of stone, is not stone but the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.</p>
<p>The more one advances in spiritual consciousness, the more he can understand the elements of devotional service.</p>
<p>Nothing in devotional service is material; everything is spiritual.</p>
<p>Consequently a devotee is awarded so-called material opulence for spiritual advancement.</p>
<p>This opulence is an aid to help the devotee advance toward the spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus Maharaja Citraketu remained in material opulence as a vidyadhara-pati, master of the Vidyadharas, and by executing devotional service he became perfect within a very few days and returned home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Sesa, Ananta.</p>
<p>A karmi’s material opulence and a devotee’s material opulence are not on the same level.</p>
<p>Srila Madhvacarya comments in this way:</p>
<p>anyantaryaminam visnum</p>
<p>upasyanya-samipagah</p>
<p>bhaved yogyataya tasya</p>
<p>padam va prapnuyan narah</p>
<p>By worshiping Lord Visnu one can get whatever he desires, but a pure devotee never asks Lord Visnu for any material profit.</p>
<p>Instead he serves Lord Visnu without material desires and is therefore ultimately transferred to the spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>In this regard, Srila Viraraghava Acarya comments, yathesta-gatir ity arthah: by worshiping Visnu, a devotee can get whatever he likes.</p>
<p>Maharaja Citraketu wanted only to return home, back to Godhead, and therefore he achieved success in that way.</p>

<p>The word tad-darsana-dhvasta-samasta-kilbisah is very important in this verse.</p>
<p>If one regularly sees the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the temple, one will gradually be disinfected of all material desires simply by visiting the temple and seeing the Deity.</p>

<p>Citraketu said: O unconquerable Lord, although You cannot be conquered by anyone, You are certainly conquered by devotees who have control of the mind and senses.</p>
<p>They can keep You under their control because You are causelessly merciful to devotees who desire no material profit from You.</p>
<p>Indeed, You give Yourself to them, and because of this You also have full control over Your devotees.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord and the devotees both conquer.</p>
<p>The Lord is conquered by the devotees, and the devotees are conquered by the Lord.</p>
<p>Because of being conquered by one another, they both derive transcendental bliss from their relationship.</p>
<p>The highest perfection of this mutual conquering is exhibited by Krsna and the gopis.</p>
<p>The gopis conquered Krsna, and Krsna conquered the gopis.</p>
<p>Thus whenever Krsna played His flute, He conquered the minds of the gopis, and without seeing the gopis Krsna could not be happy.</p>
<p>Other transcendentalists, such as jnanis and yogis, cannot conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead; only pure devotees can conquer Him.</p>
<p>Pure devotees are described as sama-mati, which means that they never deviate from devotional service under any circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not that devotees worship the Supreme Lord only when happy; they worship Him even when in distress.</p>
<p>Happiness and distress do not hamper the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam says that devotional service is ahaituky apratihata, unmotivated and uninterrupted.</p>
<p>When a devotee offers devotional service to the Lord without any motive (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11), his service cannot be hampered by any material condition (apratihata).</p>
<p>Thus a devotee who offers service in all conditions of life can conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>A special distinction between devotees and the other transcendentalists, namely the jnanis and yogis, is that jnanis and yogis artificially try to become one with the Supreme, whereas devotees never aspire for such an impossible accomplishment.</p>
<p>Devotees know that their position is to be eternally servants of the Supreme Lord and never to be one with Him.</p>
<p>Therefore they are called sama-mati or jitatma.</p>
<p>They detest oneness with the Supreme.</p>
<p>They have no lusty desires for oneness; instead, their desire is to be freed from all material hankering.</p>
<p>Therefore they are called niskama, desireless.</p>
<p>A living entity cannot exist without desires, but desires that can never be fulfilled are called kama, lusty desires.</p>
<p>Kamais tais tair hrta jnanah: (Bg.7.20) because of lusty desires, nondevotees are deprived of their intelligence.</p>
<p>Thus they are unable to conquer the Supreme Lord, whereas devotees, being freed from such unreasonable desires, can conquer the Lord.</p>
<p>Such devotees are also conquered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Because they are pure, being free from all material desires, they fully surrender to the Supreme Lord, and therefore the Lord conquers them.</p>
<p>Such devotees never aspire for liberation.</p>
<p>They simply desire to serve the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>
<p>Because they serve the Lord without desires for remuneration, they can conquer the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord is by nature very merciful, and when He sees that His servant is working without desires for material profit, naturally He is conquered.</p>
<p>Devotees are always engaged in service sa vai manah krsna-padaravindayor</p>
<p>vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane</p>
<p>All the activities of their senses are engaged in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>Because of such devotion, the Lord gives Himself to His devotees as if they could use Him for any purpose they might desire.</p>
<p>Of course, devotees have no purpose other than to serve.</p>
<p>When a devotee fully surrenders and has no aspiration for material profit, the Lord certainly gives him all opportunities for service.</p>
<p>This is the position of the Lord when conquered by His devotees.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear Lord, this cosmic manifestation and its creation, maintenance and annihilation are all but Your opulences.</p>
<p>Since Lord Brahma and the other creators are nothing but small portions of a portion of You, their partial power to create does not make them God (isvara).</p>
<p>Their consciousness of themselves as separate Lords is therefore merely false prestige.</p>
<p>It is not valid.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A devotee who has fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord knows very well that the creative energy of the living entities, from Lord Brahma down to the small ant, exists because the living entities are part and parcel of the Lord.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (15.7) the Lord says, mamaivamso jiva-loke jiva-bhutah sanatanah: The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts The living entities are nothing but very small portions of the supreme spirit, like sparks of a fire.</p>
<p>Because they are part of the Supreme, they have a creative quality in a very minute quantity.</p>
<p>The so-called scientists of the modern materialistic world are proud because they have created modern facilities like great airplanes, but the credit for creating the airplanes should go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to the scientists who have invented or created the so-called wonderful products.</p>
<p>The first consideration is the intelligence of the scientist; one must be elevated by the dictation of the Supreme Lord, who says in Bhagavad-gita (15.15), mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: From Me comes remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness Because the Supreme Lord, as Supersoul, sits within the core of every living entity’s heart, the dictation by which one advances in scientific knowledge or creative faculties comes from Him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ingredients to manufacture wonderful machines like airplanes are also supplied by the Lord, not by the scientists.</p>
<p>Before the airplane was created, its ingredients already existed, having been caused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but when the manifested creation of the airplane is ruined, the remaining debris is a problem for the so-called creators.</p>
<p>Another example is that the West is creating many automobiles.</p>
<p>The ingredients for these cars are supplied, of course, by the Supreme Lord, and the intelligence for the so-called creation is also supplied by the Lord.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when the cars are demolished, the so-called creators are faced with the problem of what to do with their ingredients.</p>
<p>The actual creator, the original creator, is the Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Only in the interim does someone create something with intelligence supplied by the Lord, and later the creation again becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Therefore the so-called creator is not to be credited with the act of creation; the only credit goes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is rightly stated herein that the credit for all the opulences of creation, maintenance and annihilation belongs to the Supreme Lord, not to the living entities.</p>

<p>You exist in the beginning, middle and end of everything, from the most minute particle of the cosmic manifestation—the atom—to the gigantic universes and total material energy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, You are eternal, having no beginning, end or middle.</p>
<p>You are perceived to exist in these three phases, and thus You are permanent.</p>
<p>When the cosmic manifestation does not exist, You exist as the original potency.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.33) says:</p>
<p>advaitam acyutam anadim ananta-rupam</p>
<p>adyam purana-purusam nava-yauvanam ca</p>
<p>vedesu durlabham adurlabham atma-bhaktau</p>
<p>govindam adi-purusam tam aham bhajami</p>
<p>I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda (Krsna), who is the original person—absolute, infallible, without beginning, although expanded into unlimited forms, still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth.</p>
<p>Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord cannot be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no cause, for He is the cause of everything.</p>
<p>The Lord is beyond the workings of cause and effect.</p>
<p>He is eternally existing.</p>
<p>In another verse the Brahma-samhita says, andantara-stha-paramanu-cayantara-stham: the Lord exists within the gigantic universe and within the atom.</p>
<p>The descent of the Lord into the atom and the universe indicates that without His presence, nothing could factually exist.</p>
<p>Scientists say that water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, but when they see a vast ocean they are puzzled about where such a quantity of hydrogen and oxygen could have come from.</p>
<p>They think that everything evolved from chemicals, but where did the chemicals come from? That they do not know.</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, He can produce immense quantities of chemicals to create a situation for chemical evolution.</p>
<p>We actually see that chemicals are produced from living entities.</p>
<p>For example, a lemon tree produces many tons of citric acid.</p>
<p>The citric acid is not the cause of the tree; rather, the tree is the cause of the acid.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of everything.</p>
<p>He is the cause of the tree that produces the citric acid (bijam mam sarva-bhutanam).</p>
<p>Devotees can see that the original potencies causing the cosmic manifestation are not in chemicals but in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for He is the cause of the chemicals.</p>
<p>Everything is caused or manifested by the energy of the Supreme Lord, and when everything is annihilated or dissolved, the original potency enters the body of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore this verse says, adav ante ’pi ca sattvanam yad dhruvam tad evantarale ’pi.</p>
<p>The word dhruvam means permanent The permanent reality is Krsna, not this cosmic manifestation.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, aham adir hi devanam and mattah sarvam pravartate: Krsna is the original cause of everything.</p>
<p>Arjuna recognized Lord Sri Krsna as the original person (purusam sasvatam divyam adi-devam ajam vibhum), and the Brahma-samhita describes Him as the original person (govindam adi-purusam).</p>
<p>He is the cause of all causes, whether at the beginning, at the end or in the middle.</p>

<p>Brahma-samhita (5.48) says:</p>

<p>visnur mahan sa iha yasya kala-viseso</p>

<p>The origin of the material creation is Maha-Visnu, who lies in the Causal Ocean.</p>
<p>While He sleeps in that ocean, millions of universes are generated as He exhales, and they are all annihilated when He inhales.</p>
<p>This Maha-Visnu is a plenary portion of a portion of Visnu, Govinda (yasya kala-visesah).</p>
<p>The word kala refers to a plenary portion of a plenary portion.</p>
<p>From Krsna, or Govinda, comes Balarama; from Balarama comes Sankarsana; from Sankarsana, Narayana; from Narayana, the second Sankarsana; from the second Sankarsana, Maha-Visnu; from Maha-Visnu, Garbhodakasayi Visnu; and from Garbhodakasayi Visnu, Ksirodakasayi Visnu.</p>
<p>Ksirodakasayi Visnu controls every universe.</p>
<p>This gives an idea of the meaning of ananta, unlimited.</p>
<p>What is to be said of the unlimited potency and existence of the Lord? This verse describes the coverings of the universe (saptabhir dasa-gunottarair anda-kosah).</p>
<p>The first covering is earth, the second is water, the third is fire, the fourth is air, the fifth is sky, the sixth is the total material energy, and the seventh is the false ego.</p>
<p>Beginning with the covering of earth, each covering is ten times greater than the previous one.</p>
<p>Thus we can only imagine how great each universe is, and there are many millions of universes.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O Supreme Lord, if persons obsessed with material desires for sense gratification through material opulence worship You, who are the source of all knowledge and are transcendental to material qualities, they are not subject to material rebirth, just as sterilized or fried seeds do not produce plants.</p>
<p>Living entities are subjected to the repetition of birth and death because they are conditioned by material nature, but since You are transcendental, one who is inclined to associate with You in transcendence escapes the conditions of material nature.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (4.9), wherein the Lord says:</p>
<p>janma karma ca me divyam</p>
<p>evam yo vetti tattvatah</p>
<p>tyaktva deham punar janma</p>
<p>naiti mam eti so ’rjuna</p>
<p>One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna If one simply engages in Krsna consciousness to understand Krsna, he surely becomes immune to the process of repeated birth and death.</p>
<p>As clearly stated in Bhagavad-gita, tyaktva deham punar janma naiti: (Bg.4.9) such a person, simply by engaging in Krsna consciousness or understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, becomes quite fit to return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>Even those who are obsessed with material desires may also come to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead so steadily that they go back to Godhead.</p>
<p>The fact is that if one comes to Krsna consciousness, although he may have many material desires, he becomes increasingly attracted to the lotus feet of Krsna through associating with the Supreme Lord by chanting His holy name.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord and His holy name are identical.</p>
<p>Thus he becomes uninterested in attachment to material enjoyment.</p>
<p>The perfection of life is to be uninterested in material enjoyment and interested in Krsna.</p>

<p>In other words, they accept the process of bhagavata-dharma to achieve shelter at Your lotus feet.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated by Srila Rupa Gosvami in Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu:</p>
<p>anyabhilasita-sunyam</p>
<p>jnana-karmady-anavrtam</p>
<p>anukulyena krsnanu-</p>
<p>silanam bhaktir uttama</p>
<p>(Madhya 19.167)</p>
<p>One should render transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord Krsna favorably and without desires for material profit or gain through fruitive activities or philosophical speculation.</p>
<p>That is called pure devotional service The Narada-pancaratra also says:</p>
<p>sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam</p>
<p>tat-paratvena nirmalam</p>
<p>hrsikena hrsikesa-</p>
<p>sevanam bhaktir ucyate</p>
<p>(Cc.Madhya 19.170)</p>
<p>One should be free from all material designations and cleansed of all material contamination.</p>
<p>He should be restored to his pure identity, in which he engages his senses in the service of the proprietor of the senses.</p>
<p>That is called devotional service This is also called bhagavata-dharma.</p>
<p>Without material aspirations, one should simply serve Krsna, as advised in Bhagavad-gita, Narada-pancaratra and Srimad-Bhagavatam.Bhagavata-dharma is the process of religion enunciated by pure devotees, direct representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead like Narada, Sukadeva Gosvami and their humble servants in the disciplic succession.</p>
<p>By understanding bhagavata-dharma, one immediately becomes free from material contamination.</p>
<p>Living entities, who are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are loitering in this material world suffering.</p>
<p>When they are instructed by the Lord Himself about bhagavata-dharma and they adopt it, that is victory for the Lord, for He then reclaims these fallen souls.</p>
<p>A devotee following the principles of bhagavata-dharma feels very much obligated to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He can understand the difference between life without bhagavata-dharma and life with bhagavata-dharma and thus he ever remains obliged to the Lord.</p>
<p>Taking to Krsna consciousness and bringing fallen souls to Krsna consciousness is victory for Lord Krsna sa vai pumsam paro dharmo</p>

<p>The supreme occupation (dharma) for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord.</p>
<p>Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self (Bhag.1.2.6) Therefore Srimad-Bhagavatam is the pure transcendental process of religion.</p>

<p>Being full of contradictions, all forms of religion but bhagavata-dharma work under conceptions of fruitive results and distinctions of you and  and yours and mine The followers of Srimad-Bhagavatam have no such consciousness.</p>
<p>They are all Krsna conscious, thinking that they are Krsna’s and Krsna is theirs.</p>
<p>There are other, low-class religious systems, which are contemplated for the killing of enemies or the gain of mystic power, but such religious systems, being full of passion and envy, are impure and temporary.</p>
<p>Because they are full of envy, they are full of irreligion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bhagavata-dharma has no contradictions.</p>
<p>Conceptions of your religio and my religio are completely absent from bhagavata-dharma.Bhagavata-dharma means following the orders given by the Supreme Lord, Bhagavan, as stated in Bhagavad-gita: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja (Bg.18.66).</p>
<p>God is one, and God is for everyone.</p>
<p>Therefore everyone must surrender to God.</p>
<p>That is the pure conception of religion.</p>
<p>Whatever God orders constitutes religion (dharmam tu saksad bhagavat-pranitam (SB 6.3.19)).</p>
<p>In bhagavata-dharma there is no question of what you believ and what I believe Everyone must believe in the Supreme Lord and carry out His orders.</p>
<p>Anukulyena krsnanusilanam: whatever Krsna says—whatever God says—should be directly carried out.</p>
<p>That is dharma, religion.</p>
<p>If one is actually Krsna conscious, he cannot have any enemies.</p>
<p>Since his only engagement is to induce others to surrender to Krsna, or God, how can he have enemies? If one advocates the Hindu religion, the Muslim religion, the Christian religion, this religion or that religion, there will be conflicts.</p>
<p>History shows that the followers of religious systems without a clear conception of God have fought with one another.</p>
<p>There are many instances of this in human history, but systems of religion that do not concentrate upon service to the Supreme are temporary and cannot last for long because they are full of envy.</p>
<p>There are many activities directed against such religious systems, and therefore one must give up the idea of my belie and your belief Everyone should believe in God and surrender unto Him.</p>
<p>That is bhagavata-dharma.Bhagavata-dharma is not a concocted sectarian belief, for it entails research to find how everything is connected with Krsna (isavasyam idam sarvam).</p>
<p>According to the Vedic injunctions, sarvam khalv idam brahma: Brahman, the Supreme, is present in everything.Bhagavata-dharma captures this presence of the Supreme.Bhagavata-dharma does not consider everything in the world to be false.</p>
<p>Because everything emanates from the Supreme, nothing can be false; everything has some use in the service of the Supreme.</p>
<p>For example, we are now dictating into a microphone and recording on a dictating machine, and thus we are finding how the machine can be connected to the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p>Since we are using this machine in the service of the Lord, it is Brahman.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of sarvam khalv idam brahma.</p>
<p>Everything is Brahman because everything can be used for the service of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Nothing is mithya, false; everything is factual.Bhagavata-dharma is called sarvotkrsta, the best of all religious systems, because those who follow bhagavata-dharma are not envious of anyone.</p>
<p>Pure bhagavatas, pure devotees, invite everyone, without envy, to join the Krsna consciousness movement.</p>
<p>A devotee is therefore exactly like the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Suhrdam sarva-bhutanam: he is the friend of all living entities.</p>
<p>Therefore this is the best of all religious systems.</p>
<p>Whereas so-called religions are meant for a particular type of person who believes in a particular way, such discrimination has no place in Krsna consciousness, or bhagavata-dharma.</p>
<p>If we scrutinize the religious systems meant for worship of demigods or anyone else but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we will find that they are full of envy and therefore impure.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>How can a religious system that produces envy of one’s self and of others be beneficial for oneself and for them? What is auspicious about following such a system? What is actually to be gained? By causing pain to one’s own self due to self-envy and by causing pain to others, one arouses Your anger and practices irreligion.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Any religious system but the process of bhagavata-dharma—service as an eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead—is a system of envy of one’s own self and of others.</p>
<p>For example, there are many systems of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended.</p>
<p>Such animal sacrifices are inauspicious both for the performer and for the animal.</p>
<p>Although one is sometimes permitted to sacrifice an animal before the goddess Kali and eat it instead of purchasing meat from a slaughterhouse, permission to eat meat after a sacrifice in the presence of the goddess Kali is not the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>It is simply a concession for the miserable person who will not give up eating meat.</p>
<p>It is meant to restrict his desire for unrestricted meat-eating.</p>
<p>Such a religious system is condemned.</p>
<p>Therefore Krsna says, sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja: (Bg.18.66) Give up all other duties and surrender unto Me That is the last word in religion.</p>
<p>One may argue that the sacrifice of animals is recommended in the Vedas.</p>
<p>This recommendation, however, is a restriction.</p>
<p>Without Vedic restrictions on the purchase of meat, people will purchase meat from the market, which will be overflooded with meat shops, and slaughterhouses will increase.</p>
<p>To restrict this, sometimes the Vedas say that one may eat meat after sacrificing an insignificant animal like a goat before the goddess Kali.</p>
<p>In any case, a system of religion in which animal sacrifices are recommended is inauspicious for those who perform the sacrifices and for the animals.</p>
<p>Envious persons who perform ostentatious animal sacrifices are condemned in Bhagavad-gita (16.17) as follows:</p>
<p>atma-sambhavitah stabdha</p>
<p>dhana-mana-madanvitah</p>
<p>yajante nama-yajnais te</p>
<p>dambhenavidhi-purvakam</p>
<p>Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations Sometimes animal sacrifices are performed very gorgeously with grand arrangements for worshiping the goddess Kali, but such festivals, although performed in the name of yajna, are not actually yajna, for yajna means to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore it is recommended that in this age specifically, yajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasah: (SB 11.5.32) those who have good intelligence satisfy the yajna-purusa, Visnu, by chanting the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>Envious persons, however, are condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as follows:</p>
<p>ahankaram balam darpam</p>
<p>kamam krodham ca samsritah</p>
<p>mam atma-para-dehesu</p>
<p>pradvisanto ’bhyasuyakah</p>
<p>tan aham dvisatah kruran</p>
<p>samsaresu naradhaman</p>
<p>ksipamy ajasram asubhan</p>
<p>asurisv eva yonisu</p>
<p>Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion.</p>
<p>Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life (Bg.16.18–19) These persons are condemned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as indicated by the words tava kopah.</p>
<p>A person who commits murder is envious of himself and also the person he has killed, for the result of committing murder is that he will be arrested and hanged.</p>
<p>If one transgresses the laws of a man-made government, he may escape being killed by the state, but one cannot escape the laws of God.</p>
<p>A killer of any animal must be killed in his next life by the same animal.</p>
<p>This is the law of nature.</p>
<p>One must follow the instructions of the Supreme Lord: sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja (Bg.18.66).</p>
<p>If one follows any other system of religion, he is subject to punishment by the Supreme Personality of Godhead in many different ways.</p>
<p>Therefore if one follows a concocted system of religion, he is envious not only of others but also of himself.</p>
<p>Consequently his system of religion is useless.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.8) says:</p>
<p>dharmah svanusthitah pumsam</p>
<p>visvaksena-kathasu yah</p>
<p>notpadayed yadi ratim</p>
<p>srama eva hi kevalam</p>
<p>Duties (dharma) executed by men, regardless of occupation, are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord Following a system of religion that does not awaken one’s Krsna consciousness, or God consciousness, is merely a waste of time and labor.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>My dear Lord, one’s occupational duty is instructed in Srimad-Bhagavatam and Bhagavad-gita according to Your point of view, which never deviates from the highest goal of life.</p>
<p>Those who follow their occupational duties under Your supervision, being equal to all living entities, moving and nonmoving, and not considering high and low, are called Aryans.</p>
<p>Such Aryans worship You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Bhagavata-dharma and krsna-katha are identical.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu wanted everyone to become a guru and preach the instructions of Krsna everywhere from Bhagavad-gita, Srimad-Bhagavatam, the Puranas, Vedanta-sutra and similar Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>Aryans, who are advanced in civilization, follow bhagavata-dharma.</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja, although merely a child of five years, recommended:</p>
<p>kaumara acaret prajno</p>
<p>dharman bhagavatan iha</p>
<p>durlabham manusam janma</p>
<p>tad apy adhruvam arthadam</p>
<p>(Bhag.7.6.1)</p>
<p>Prahlada Maharaja preached bhagavata-dharma among his classmates as soon as an opportunity was afforded by the absence of his teachers from the classroom.</p>
<p>He said that from the very beginning of life, from the age of five, children should be instructed about bhagavata-dharma because the human form of life, which is very rarely obtained, is meant for understanding this subject.Bhagavata-dharma means living according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita we find that the Supreme Lord has arranged human society in four social divisions, namely brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sudra.</p>
<p>Again, the Puranas and other Vedic literatures set forth four asramas, which are the divisions of spiritual life.</p>
<p>Therefore bhagavata-dharma means the varnasrama-dharma of the four social and four spiritual divisions.</p>
<p>The members of human society who strictly follow the principles of bhagavata-dharma and live according to the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are called Aryans or arya.</p>
<p>A civilization of Aryans who strictly follow the instructions of the Lord and never deviate from those instructions is perfect.</p>
<p>Such civilized men do not discriminate between trees, animals, human beings and other living entities panditah sama-darsinah: (Bg.5.18) because they are completely educated in Krsna consciousness, they see all living beings equally.</p>
<p>Aryans do not kill even a small plant unnecessarily, not to speak of cutting trees for sense gratification.</p>
<p>At the present moment, throughout the world, killing is prominent.</p>
<p>Men are killing trees, they are killing animals, and they are killing other human beings also, all for sense gratification.</p>
<p>This is not an Aryan civilization.</p>
<p>As stated here, sthira-cara-sattva-kadambesv aprthag-dhiyah.</p>
<p>The word aprthag-dhiyah indicates that Aryans do not distinguish between lower and higher grades of life.</p>
<p>All life should be protected.</p>
<p>All living beings have a right to live, even the trees and plants.</p>
<p>This is the basic principle of an Aryan civilization.</p>
<p>Apart from the lower living entities, those who have come to the platform of human civilization should be divided into a society of brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras.</p>
<p>The brahmanas should follow the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as stated in Bhagavad-gita and other Vedic literatures.</p>
<p>The criterion must be guna and karma.</p>
<p>In other words, one should acquire the qualities of a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sudra and act accordingly.</p>
<p>This is the civilization accepted by the Aryans.</p>
<p>Why do they accept it? They accept it because they are very much eager to satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>This is perfect civilization.</p>
<p>Aryans do not deviate from the instructions of Krsna, nor do they have doubts about Krsna, but non-Aryans and other demoniac people fail to follow the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.</p>
<p>This is because they have been trained in sense gratification at the cost of all other living entities.</p>
<p>Nunam pramattah kurute vikarma: (Bhag.5.5.4) their only business is to indulge in all kinds of forbidden activities for sense gratification.</p>
<p>Yad indriya-pritaya aprnoti: they deviate in this way because they want to gratify their senses.</p>
<p>They have no other occupation or ambition.</p>
<p>Their method of civilization is condemned in the previous verse.</p>
<p>Kah ksemo nija-parayoh kiyan varthah sva-para-druha dharmena: What is the meaning of a civilization that kills oneself and others This verse, therefore, advises that everyone become a member of the Aryan civilization and accept the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One should conduct his social, political and religious affairs according to His instructions.</p>
<p>We are spreading the Krsna consciousness movement to try to establish a society the way that Krsna wants it.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>We are therefore presenting Bhagavad-gita as it is and kicking out all kinds of mental concoction.</p>
<p>Fools and rascals interpret Bhagavad-gita in their own way.</p>
<p>When Krsna says, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto mad-yaji mam namaskuru (Bg.18.65)—Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer your homage unto M—they comment that it is not Krsna to whom we must surrender.</p>
<p>Thus they derive imaginary meanings from Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement, however, strictly follows bhagavata-dharma, the instructions of Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam for the complete welfare of human society.</p>
<p>One who misinterprets Bhagavad-gita, twisting out some meaning for his sense gratification, is a non-Aryan.</p>
<p>Therefore commentaries on Bhagavad-gita by such persons should be immediately rejected.</p>
<p>One should try to follow Bhagavad-gita as it is.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (12.6–7) Lord Sri Krsna says:</p>
<p>ye tu sarvani karmani</p>
<p>mayi sannyasya mat-parah</p>
<p>ananyenaiva yogena</p>
<p>mam dhyayanta upasate</p>
<p>tesam aham samuddharta</p>
<p>mrtyu-samsara-sagarat</p>
<p>bhavami na cirat partha</p>
<p>mayy avesita-cetasam</p>
<p>For one who worships Me, giving up all his activities unto Me and being devoted to Me without deviation, engaged in devotional service and always meditating upon Me, who has fixed his mind upon Me, O son of Prtha, for him I am the swift deliverer from the ocean of birth and death</p>

<p>My Lord, it is not impossible for one to be immediately freed from all material contamination by seeing You.</p>
<p>Not to speak of seeing You personally, merely by hearing the holy name of Your Lordship only once, even candalas, men of the lowest class, are freed from all material contamination.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, who will not be freed from material contamination simply by seeing You?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.5.16), yan-nama-sruti-matrena puman bhavati nirmalah: simply by hearing the holy name of the Lord, one is immediately purified.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this age of Kali, when all people are very contaminated, the chanting of the holy name of the Lord is recommended as the only means of improvement harer nama harer nama</p>

<p>kalau nasty eva nasty eva</p>
<p>nasty eva gatir anyatha</p>

<p>In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is the chanting of the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way.</p>
<p>There is no other way (Brhan-naradiya Purana) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu introduced this chanting of the holy name five hundred years ago, and now through the Krsna consciousness movement, the Hare Krsna movement, we are actually seeing that men who are considered to belong to the lowest class are being delivered from all sinful activities simply by hearing the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Samsara, material existence, is a result of sinful actions.</p>
<p>Everyone in this material world is condemned, yet as there are different grades of prisoners, there are different grades of men.</p>
<p>All of them, in all statuses of life, are suffering.</p>
<p>To stop the suffering of material existence, one must take to the Hare Krsna movement of sankirtana or Krsna conscious life.</p>
<p>Herein it is said, yan-nama sakrc chravanat: the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so powerful that if once heard without offenses, it can purify the lowest of men (kirata-hunandhra-pulinda-pulkasah).</p>
<p>Such men, who are called candalas, are less than sudras, but they also can be purified simply by hearing the holy name of the Lord, not to speak of personally seeing the Lord.</p>
<p>From our present position, the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be personally seen as the Deity in the temple.</p>
<p>The Deity of the Lord is not different from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Because we cannot see the Supreme Lord with our present blunt eyes, the Lord has kindly consented to come before us in a form we can see.</p>
<p>Therefore the Deity in the temple should not be considered material.</p>
<p>By offering food to the Deity and by decorating and serving the Deity, one gets the same result that one derives from serving the Lord personally in Vaikuntha.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>aham—I; vai—indeed; sarva-bhutani—expanded in different forms of living entities; bhuta-atma—the Supersoul of all living entities (the supreme director and enjoyer of them); bhuta-bhavanah—the cause for the manifestation of all living entities; sabda-brahma—the transcendental sound vibration (the Hare Krsna mantra); param brahma—the Supreme Absolute Truth; mama—My; ubhe—both (namely, the form of sound and the form of spiritual identity); sasvati—eternal; tanu—two bodies.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>All living entities, moving and nonmoving, are My expansions and are separate from Me.</p>
<p>I am the Supersoul of all living beings, who exist because I manifest them.</p>
<p>I am the form of the transcendental vibrations like omkara and Hare Krsna Hare Rama, and I am the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p>
<p>These two forms of Mine—namely, the transcendental sound and the eternally blissful spiritual form of the Deity, are My eternal forms; they are not material.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The science of devotional service has been instructed by Narada and Angira to Citraketu.</p>
<p>Now, because of Citraketu’s devotional service, he has seen the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>By performing devotional service, one advances step by step, and when one is on the platform of love of Godhead (prema pumartho mahan) he sees the Supreme Lord at every moment.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita, when one engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day (tesam satata-yuktanam bhajatam priti-purvakam (Bg.10.10)) in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual master, his devotional service becomes more and more pleasing.</p>
<p>Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is within the core of everyone’s heart, speaks to the devotee (dadami buddhi-yogam tam yena mam upayanti te).</p>
<p>Citraketu Maharaja was first instructed by his gurus, Angira and Narada, and now, having followed their instructions, he has come to the stage of seeing the Supreme Lord face to face.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is now instructing him in the essence of knowledge.</p>
<p>The essence of knowledge is that there are two kinds of vastu, or substances, One is real, and the other, being illusory or temporary, is sometimes called nonfactual.</p>
<p>One must consider these two kinds of existence.</p>
<p>The real tattva, or truth, consists of Brahman, Paramatma, and Bhagavan.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.11):</p>
<p>vadanti tat tattva-vidas</p>
<p>tattvam yaj jnanam advayam</p>
<p>brahmeti paramatmeti</p>
<p>bhagavan iti sabdyate</p>
<p>Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this nondual substance Brahman, Paramatma or Bhagavan The Absolute Truth exists eternally in three features.</p>
<p>Therefore, Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan combined are the substance.</p>
<p>The categories of emanations from the nonsubstance are two—activities and forbidden activities (karma and vikarma).</p>
<p>Karma refers to the pious life or material activities performed during the day and the mental activities of dreams at night.</p>
<p>These are more or less desired activities.</p>
<p>Vikarma, however, refers to illusory activities, which are something like the will-o’-the-wisp.</p>
<p>These are activities that have no meaning.</p>
<p>For example, modern scientists imagine that life can be produced from chemical combinations, and they are very busy trying to prove this in laboratories throughout the world, although no one in history has been able to produce the substance of life from material combinations.</p>
<p>Such activities are called vikarma.</p>
<p>All material activities are actually illusory, and progress in illusion is simply a waste of time.</p>
<p>These illusory activities are called akarya, and one must learn of them from the instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (4.17):</p>
<p>karmano hy api boddhavyam</p>
<p>boddhavyam ca vikarmanah</p>
<p>akarmanas ca boddhavyam</p>
<p>gahana karmano gatih</p>
<p>The intricacies of action are very hard to understand.</p>
<p>Therefore one should know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is One must learn of these directly from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who, as Anantadeva, is instructing King Citraketu because of the advanced stage of devotional service he achieved by following the instructions of Narada and Angira.</p>
<p>Herein it is said, aham vai sarva-bhutani: the Lord is everything (sarva-bhutani), including the living entities and the material or physical elements.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (7.4–5):</p>
<p>bhumir apo ’nalo vayuh</p>
<p>kham mano buddhir eva ca</p>
<p>ahankara itiyam me</p>
<p>bhinna prakrtir astadha</p>
<p>apareyam itas tv anyam</p>
<p>prakrtim viddhi me param</p>
<p>jiva-bhutam maha-baho</p>
<p>yayedam dharyate jagat</p>
<p>Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego—all together these eight comprise My separated material energies.</p>
<p>Besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of the living entities, who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe The living entity tries to lord it over the material or physical elements, but both the physical elements and the spiritual spark are energies emanating from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord says, aham vai sarva-bhutani: I am everything Just as heat and light emanate from fire, these two energies—the physical elements and the living entities—emanate from the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord says, aham vai sarva-bhutani: I expand the physical and spiritual categories Again, the Lord, as the Supersoul, guides the living entities who are conditioned by the physical atmosphere.</p>
<p>Therefore he is called bhutatma bhuta-bhavanah.</p>
<p>He gives the living entity the intelligence with which to improve his position so that he may return home, back to Godhead, or if he does not want to go back to Godhead, the Lord gives him the intelligence with which to improve his material position.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gita (15.15).</p>
<p>Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivisto mattah smrtir jnanam apohanam ca: I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness From within, the Lord gives the living being the intelligence with which to work.</p>
<p>Therefore the previous verse said that after the Supreme Personality of Godhead endeavors, our endeavors begin.</p>
<p>We cannot independently endeavor or act upon anything.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord is bhuta-bhavanah.</p>
<p>Another specific feature of the knowledge given in this verse is that sabda-brahma is also a form of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In His eternal, blissful form, Lord Krsna is accepted by Arjuna as param brahma.</p>
<p>A living entity in the conditioned stage accepts something illusory as substantial.</p>
<p>This is called maya or avidya—ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore according to the Vedic knowledge, one must become a devotee, and one must then distinguish between avidya and vidya, which are elaborately explained in the Isopanisad.</p>
<p>When one is actually on the platform of vidya, he can personally understand the Personality of Godhead in His forms like those of Lord Rama, Lord Krsna and Sankarsana.</p>
<p>The Vedic knowledge is described as the breathing of the Supreme Lord, and activities begin on the basis of Vedic knowledge.</p>
<p>Therefore the Lord says that when He endeavors or breathes, the material universes come into existence, and various activities gradually develop.</p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, pranavah sarva-vedesu: I am the syllable om in all the Vedic mantras Vedic knowledge begins with the vibration of the transcendental sound pranava, omkara.</p>
<p>The same transcendental sound is Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>Abhinnatvan nama-naminoh: there is no difference between the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In this world of matter, which the conditioned soul accepts as consisting of enjoyable resources, the conditioned soul expands, thinking that he is the enjoyer of the material world.</p>
<p>Similarly, the material world expands in the living entity as a source of enjoyment.</p>
<p>In this way they both expand, but because they are My energies, they are both pervaded by Me.</p>
<p>As the Supreme Lord, I am the cause of these effects, and one should know that both of them rest in Me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Mayavada philosophy sees everything as being equal in quality with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Supreme Brahman, and therefore sees everything as worshipable.</p>
<p>This dangerous theory of the Mayavada school has turned people in general toward atheism.</p>
<p>On the strength of this theory, one thinks that he is God, but this is not a fact.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (maya tatam idam sarvam jagad avyakta-murtina), the fact is that the entire cosmic manifestation is an expansion of the Supreme Lord’s energies, which are manifested in the physical elements and the living entities.</p>
<p>The living entities wrongly consider the physical elements to be resources meant for their enjoyment, and they think themselves to be the enjoyers.</p>
<p>However, neither of them is independent; they are both energies of the Lord.</p>
<p>The original cause for the material energy and spiritual energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>However, although the expansion of the Lord’s energies is the original cause, one should not think that the Lord Himself has expanded in different ways.</p>
<p>To condemn the theories of the Mayavadis, the Lord clearly says in Bhagavad-gita, mat-sthani sarva-bhutani na caham tesv avasthitah: All beings are in Me, but I am not in them Everything rests upon Him, and everything is but an expansion of His energies, but this does not mean that everything is as worshipable as the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The material expansion is temporary, but the Lord is not temporary.</p>
<p>The living entities are parts of the Lord, but they are not the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>The living entities in this material world are not inconceivable, but the Lord is.</p>
<p>The theory that the Lord’s energies, being expansions of the Lord, are as good as the Lord is mistaken.</p>

<p>When a person is in deep sleep, he dreams and sees in himself many other objects, such as great mountains and rivers or perhaps even the entire universe, although they are far away.</p>
<p>Sometimes when one awakens from a dream he sees that he is in a human form, lying in his bed in one place.</p>
<p>Then he sees himself, in terms of various conditions, as belonging to a particular nationality, family and so on.</p>
<p>All the conditions of deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness are but energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One should always remember the original creator of these conditions, the Supreme Lord, who is unaffected by them.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>None of these conditions of the living entities—namely, deep sleep, dreaming and wakefulness—is substantial.</p>
<p>They are simply displays of various phases of conditional life.</p>
<p>There may be many mountains, rivers, trees, bees, tigers and snakes that are situated far away, but in a dream one may imagine them to be nearby.</p>
<p>Similarly, as one has subtle dreams at night, when the living entity is awake he lives in gross dreams of nation, community, society, possessions, skyscrapers, bank balance, position and honor.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, one should know that his position is due to his contact with the material world.</p>
<p>One is situated in different positions in various forms of life that are all but creations of the illusory energy, which works under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Therefore the Supreme Lord is the ultimate actor, and the conditioned living entity should simply remember this original actor, Sri Krsna.</p>
<p>As living entities, we are being carried away by the waves of prakrti, or nature, which works under the Lord’s direction (mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram (Bg.9.10)).</p>
<p>Bhaktivinoda Thakura sings, (miche) mayara vase, yaccha bhese’, khaccha habudubu, bhai: Why are you being carried away by the waves of the illusory energy in various phases of dreaming and wakefulness? These are all creations of maya Our only duty is to remember the supreme director of this illusory energy—Krsna.</p>
<p>For us to do this, the sastra advises us, harer nama harer nama harer namaiva kevalam (Adi 17.21): one should constantly chant the holy name of the Lord—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>The Supreme Lord is realized in three different phases, as Brahman, Paramatma and Bhagavan, but Bhagavan is the ultimate realization.</p>
<p>One who realizes Bhagavan—the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna—is the most perfect mahatma (vasudevah sarvam iti sa mahatma sudurlabhah (Bg.7.19)).</p>
<p>In the human form of life, one should understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for then one will understand everything else.</p>
<p>Yasmin vijnate sarvam evam vijnatam bhavati.</p>
<p>According to this Vedic injunction, simply by understanding Krsna one understands Brahman, Paramatma, prakrti, the illusory energy, the spiritual energy and everything else.</p>
<p>Everything will be revealed prakrti, the material nature, is working under the direction of the Supreme Lord, and we living entities are being carried away by various phases of prakrti.</p>
<p>For self-realization, one should always remember Krsna.</p>
<p>As stated in Padma Purana, smartavyah satatam visnuh: we should always remember Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Vismartavyo na jatucit: we should never forget the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If one’s dreams during sleep are merely subject matters witnessed by the Supersoul, how can the living entity, who is different from the Supersoul, remember the activities of dreams? The experiences of one person cannot be understood by another.</p>
<p>Therefore the knower of the facts, the living entity who inquires into the incidents manifested in dreams and wakefulness, is different from the circumstantial activities.</p>
<p>That knowing factor is Brahman.</p>
<p>In other words, the quality of knowing belongs to the living entities and to the Supreme Soul.</p>
<p>Thus the living entity can also experience the activities of dreams and wakefulness.</p>
<p>In both stages the knower is unchanged, but is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In knowledge the living entity is qualitatively one with the Supreme Brahman, but the quantity of the Supreme Brahman is not the same as that of the living entity, who is part of Brahman.</p>
<p>Because the living entity is Brahman in quality, he can remember the past activities of dreams and also know the present activities of wakefulness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>When a living entity, thinking himself different from Me, forgets his spiritual identity of qualitative oneness with Me in eternity, knowledge and bliss, his material, conditional life begins.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of identifying his interest with Mine, he becomes interested in his bodily expansions like his wife, children and material possessions.</p>
<p>In this way, by the influence of his actions, one body comes from another, and after one death, another death takes place.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Generally the Mayavadi philosophers or persons influenced by Mayavadi philosophers think themselves as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>This is the cause of their conditional life.</p>
<p>As stated by the Vaisnava poet Jagadananda Pandita in his Prema-vivarta:</p>
<p>krsna-bahirmukha hana bhoga vancha kare</p>
<p>nikata-stha maya tare japatiya dhare</p>
<p>As soon as a living entity forgets his constitutional position and endeavors to become one with the Supreme, his conditional life begins.</p>
<p>The conception that the Supreme Brahman and the living entity are equal not only in quality but also in quantity is the cause of conditional life.</p>
<p>If one forgets the difference between the Supreme Lord and the living entity, his conditional life begins.</p>
<p>Conditional life means giving up one body to accept another and undergoing death to accept death again.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi philosopher teaches the philosophy of tat tvam asi, saying, You are the same as God He forgets that tat tvam asi applies in terms of the marginal position of the living entity, who is like sunshine.</p>
<p>There is heat and light in the sun, and there is heat and light in the sunshine, and thus they are qualitatively one.</p>
<p>But one should not forget that the sunshine rests on the sun.</p>
<p>As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gita, brahmano hi pratisthaham (Bg.14.27): I am the original source of Brahman The sunshine is important because of the presence of the sun globe.</p>
<p>It is not that the sun globe is important because of the all-pervasiveness of the sunshine.</p>
<p>Forgetfulness and misunderstanding of this fact is called maya.</p>
<p>Because of forgetfulness of one’s constitutional position and that of the Supreme Lord, one comes into maya, or samsara—conditional life.</p>
<p>In this regard, Madhvacarya says:</p>
<p>sarva-bhinnam paratmanam</p>
<p>vismaran samsared iha</p>
<p>abhinnam samsmaran yati</p>
<p>tamo nasty atra samsayah</p>
<p>When one thinks that the living entity is nondifferent in all respects from the Supreme Lord, there is no doubt that he is in ignorance (tamah).</p>

<p>One should further understand that the spirit soul, although very difficult for the materialist to perceive, is above all these conditions, and by the strength of one’s discrimination, one should give up the desire for fruitive results in the present life and in the next.</p>
<p>Thus becoming experienced in transcendental knowledge, one should become My devotee.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-16" id="summary-16">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#617-1" id="617-1">6.17</a></h3>
<p>The Seventeenth Chapter is summarized as follows.</p>
<p>This chapter describes Citraketu’s receiving the body of an asura, or demon, because of joking with Lord Siva.</p>
<p>After personally talking with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, King Citraketu enjoyed life in his airplane with the women of the Vidyadhara planet.</p>
<p>Engaging in the congregational chanting of the glories of the Lord, he began flying his plane and traveling in outer space.</p>
<p>One day while traveling like this, he wandered into the bowers of Sumeru Mountain, where he came upon Lord Siva embracing Parvati, surrounded by an assembly of Siddhas, Caranas and great sages.</p>
<p>Seeing Lord Siva in that situation, Citraketu laughed very loudly, but Parvati became very angry at him and cursed him.</p>
<p>Because of this curse, Citraketu later appeared as the demon Vrtrasura.</p>
<p>Citraketu, however, was not at all afraid of Parvati’s curse, and thus he spoke as follows: Everyone in human society enjoys happiness and distress according to his past deeds and in this way travels in the material world.</p>
<p>Therefore no one is responsible for his happiness and distress.</p>
<p>One is controlled by the influence of material nature in the material world, yet one thinks himself the doer of everything.</p>
<p>In this material world, which is made of the external energy of the Supreme Lord, one is sometimes cursed and sometimes favored, and thus he sometimes enjoys in the upper planetary systems and sometimes suffers in the lower planets, but all these situations are the same because they are within this material world.</p>
<p>None of these positions has any factual existence, for all of them are temporary.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate controller because the material world is created, maintained and annihilated under His control while He nonetheless remains neutral to these different transformations of the material world in time and space.</p>
<p>The material, external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is in charge of this material world.</p>
<p>The Lord helps the world by creating situations for the living entities within it When Citraketu spoke in this way, all the members in the great assembly in which Lord Siva and Parvati were present were astonished.</p>
<p>Then Lord Siva began speaking about the devotees of the Lord.</p>
<p>A devotee is neutral in all conditions of life, whether in the heavenly planets or hellish planets, whether liberated from the material world or conditioned by it, and whether blessed with happiness or subjected to distress.</p>
<p>These are all merely dualities created by the external energy.</p>
<p>Being influenced by the external energy, the living entity accepts a gross and subtle material body, and in this illusory position he apparently suffers miseries, although everyone is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The so-called demigods consider themselves independent lords, and in this way they are misled from understanding that all living entities are part of the Supreme.</p>
<p>This chapter concludes by glorifying the devotee and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>

<p>In those valleys he enjoyed life with the women of Vidyadhara-loka by chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord, Hari.</p>

<p>It is to be understood that Maharaja Citraketu, although surrounded by beautiful women from Vidyadhara-loka, did not forget to glorify the Lord by chanting the holy name of the Lord.</p>

<p>One time while King Citraketu was traveling in outer space on a brilliantly effulgent airplane given to him by Lord Visnu, he saw Lord Siva, surrounded by Siddhas and Caranas.</p>
<p>Lord Siva was sitting in an assembly of great saintly persons and embracing Parvati on his lap with his arm.</p>
<p>Citraketu laughed loudly and spoke, within the hearing of Parvati.</p>

<p>nitva tam svantike ’nayat</p>
<p>The purport is that the Supreme Personality of Godhead wanted to bring Citraketu to Vaikunthaloka as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Lord’s plan was that Citraketu be cursed by Parvati to become Vrtrasura so that in his next life he could quickly return home, back to Godhead.</p>
<p>There have been many instances in which a devotee acting as a demon has been brought to the kingdom of God by the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>For Parvati to be embraced by Lord Siva was natural in a relationship between husband and wife; this was nothing extraordinary for Citraketu to see.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Citraketu laughed loudly to see Lord Siva in that situation, even though he should not have done so.</p>
<p>Thus he was eventually cursed, and this curse was the cause of his returning home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura remarks that although Citraketu criticized Lord Siva, he did not offend Lord Siva like Daksa.</p>
<p>Daksa considered Lord Siva insignificant, but Citraketu expressed his wonder at Lord Siva’s being situated in that way.</p>

<p>The word maha-vrata-dharah indicates a brahmacari who has never fallen down.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is counted among the best of yogis, yet he embraced his wife in the midst of great saintly persons.</p>
<p>Citraketu appreciated how great Lord Siva was to be unaffected even in that situation.</p>
<p>Therefore Citraketu was not an offender; he merely expressed his wonder.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Srila Sukadeva Gosvami continued: My dear King, after hearing Citraketu’s statement, Lord Siva, the most powerful personality, whose knowledge is fathomless, simply smiled and remained silent, and all the members of the assembly followed the lord by not saying anything.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Citraketu’s purpose in criticizing Lord Siva is somewhat mysterious and cannot be understood by a common man.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, however, has made the following observations.</p>
<p>Lord Siva, being the most exalted Vaisnava and one of the most powerful demigods, is able to do anything he desires.</p>
<p>Although he was externally exhibiting the behavior of a common man and not following etiquette, such actions cannot diminish his exalted position.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that a common man, seeing Lord Siva’s behavior, might follow his example.</p>
<p>As stated in Bhagavad-gita (3.21):</p>
<p>yad yad acarati sresthas</p>
<p>tat tad evetaro janah</p>
<p>sa yat pramanam kurute</p>
<p>lokas tad anuvartate</p>
<p>Whatever action a great man performs, common men follow.</p>
<p>And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues A common man might also criticize Lord Siva, like Daksa, who suffered the consequences for his criticism.</p>
<p>King Citraketu desired that Lord Siva cease this external behavior so that others might be saved from criticizing him and thus becoming offenders.</p>
<p>If one thinks that Visnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the only perfect personality whereas the demigods, even such demigods as Lord Siva, are inclined to improper social affairs, he is an offender.</p>
<p>Considering all this, King Citraketu was somewhat harsh in his behavior with Lord Siva.</p>
<p>Lord Siva, who is always deep in knowledge, could understand Citraketu’s purpose, and therefore he was not at all angry; rather, he simply smiled and remained silent.</p>
<p>The members of the assembly surrounding Lord Siva could also understand Citraketu’s purpose.</p>
<p>Consequently, following the behavior of Lord Siva, they did not protest; instead, following their master, they remained silent.</p>
<p>If the members of the assembly thought that Citraketu had blasphemed Lord Siva, they would certainly have left at once, blocking their ears with their hands.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Not knowing the prowess of Lord Siva and Parvati, Citraketu strongly criticized them.</p>
<p>His statements were not at all pleasing, and therefore the goddess Parvati, being very angry, spoke as follows to Citraketu, who thought himself better than Lord Siva in controlling the senses.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although Citraketu never meant to insult Lord Siva, he should not have criticized the lord, even though the lord was transgressing social customs.</p>
<p>It is said, tejiyasam na dosaya: one who is very powerful should be understood to be faultless.</p>
<p>For example, one should not find faults with the sun, although it evaporates urine from the street.</p>
<p>The most powerful cannot be criticized by an ordinary man, or even by a great personality.</p>
<p>Citraketu should have known that Lord Siva, although sitting in that way, was not to be criticized.</p>
<p>The difficulty was that Citraketu, having become a great devotee of Lord Visnu, Sankarsana, was somewhat proud at having achieved Lord Sankarsana’s favor and therefore thought that he could now criticize anyone, even Lord Siva.</p>
<p>This kind of pride in a devotee is never tolerated.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava should always remain very humble and meek and offer respect to others trnad api sunicena</p>
<p>taror api sahisnuna</p>
<p>amanina manadena</p>
<p>kirtaniyah sada harih</p>
<p>(Cc.adi 17.31)</p>
<p>One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige and ready to offer all respect to others.</p>
<p>In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly A Vaisnava should not try to minimize anyone else’s position.</p>
<p>It is better to remain humble and meek and chant the Hare Krsna mantra.</p>
<p>The word nirjitatmabhimanine indicates that Citraketu thought himself a better controller of the senses than Lord Siva, although actually he was not.</p>
<p>Because of all these considerations, mother Parvati was somewhat angry at Citraketu.</p>

<p>In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the Lord constantly Unless one is humble and meek, one cannot qualify to sit at the lotus feet of the Lord.</p>

<p>atah—therefore; papiyasim—most sinful; yonim—to the species of life; asurim—demoniac; yahi—go; durmate—O impudent one; yatha—so that; iha—in this world; bhuyah—again; mahatam—to great personalities; na—not; karta—will commit; putra—my dear son; kilbisam—any offense.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O impudent one, my dear son, now take birth in a low, sinful family of demons so that you will not commit such an offense again toward exalted, saintly persons in this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>One should be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of Vaisnavas, of whom Lord Siva is the best.</p>
<p>While instructing Srila Rupa Gosvami, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu described an offense at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava as hati mata, a mad elephant.</p>
<p>When a mad elephant enters a nice garden, it spoils the entire garden.</p>
<p>Similarly, if one becomes like a mad elephant and commits offenses at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava, his entire spiritual career is halted.</p>
<p>One should therefore be very careful not to commit offenses at the lotus feet of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Mother Parvati was justified in punishing Citraketu, for Citraketu impudently criticized the supreme father, Mahadeva, who is the father of the living entities conditioned within this material world.</p>
<p>The goddess Durga is called mother, and Lord Siva is called father.</p>
<p>A pure Vaisnava should be very careful to engage in his specific duty without criticizing others.</p>
<p>This is the safest position.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if one tends to criticize others, he may commit the great offense of criticizing a Vaisnava.</p>
<p>Because Citraketu was undoubtedly a Vaisnava, he might have been surprised that Parvati had cursed him.</p>
<p>Therefore the goddess Parvati addressed him as putra, or son.</p>
<p>Everyone is the son of mother Durga, but she is not an ordinary mother.</p>
<p>As soon as there is a small discrepancy in a demon’s behavior, mother Durga immediately punishes the demon so that he may come to his senses.</p>
<p>This is explained by Lord Krsna in Bhagavad-gita (7.14):</p>
<p>daivi hy esa guna-mayi</p>
<p>mama maya duratyaya</p>
<p>mam eva ye prapadyante</p>
<p>mayam etam taranti te</p>
<p>This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>But those who have surrendered unto Me can easily cross beyond it To surrender to Krsna means to surrender to His devotees also, for no one can be a proper servant of Krsna unless he is a proper servant of a devotee.</p>
<p>Chadiya vaisnava-seva nistara payeche keba: without serving a servant of Krsna, one cannot be elevated to being a servant of Krsna Himself.</p>
<p>Therefore mother Parvati spoke to Citraketu exactly like a mother who says to her naughty child, My dear child, I am punishing you so that you won’t do anything like this again This tendency of a mother to punish her child is found even in mother Yasoda, who became the mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Mother Yasoda punished Krsna by binding Him and showing Him a stick.</p>
<p>Thus it is the duty of a mother to chastise her beloved son, even in the case of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>It is to be understood that mother Durga was justified in punishing Citraketu.</p>
<p>This punishment was a boon to Citraketu because after taking birth as the demon Vrtrasura, he was promoted directly to Vaikuntha.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Citraketu said: My dear mother, with my own hands folded together I accept the curse upon me.</p>
<p>I do not mind the curse, for happiness and distress are given by the demigods as a result of one’s past deeds.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Since Citraketu was a devotee of the Lord, he was not at all disturbed by the curse of mother Parvati.</p>
<p>He knew very well that one suffers or enjoys the results of one’s past deeds as ordained by daiva-netra—superior authority, or the agents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>He knew that he had not committed any offense at the lotus feet of Lord Siva or the goddess Parvati, yet he had been punished, and this means that the punishment had been ordained.</p>
<p>Thus the King did not mind it.</p>
<p>A devotee is naturally so humble and meek that he accepts any condition of life as a blessing from the Lord.</p>
<p>Tat te ’nukampam susamiksamanah (Bhag.10.14.8).</p>
<p>A devotee always accepts punishment from anyone as the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>If one lives in this conception of life, he sees whatever reverses occur to be due to his past misdeeds, and therefore he never accuses anyone.</p>
<p>On the contrary, he becomes increasingly attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because of his being purified by his suffering.</p>
<p>Suffering, therefore, is also a process of purification.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura says in this connection that one who has developed Krsna consciousness and who exists in love with Krsna is no longer subject to suffering and happiness under the laws of karma.</p>
<p>Indeed, he is beyond karma.</p>
<p>The Brahma-samhita says, karmani nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhajam: (Bs.5.54) a devotee is free from the reactions of his karma because he has taken to devotional service.</p>
<p>This same principle is confirmed in Bhagavad-gita (14.26).</p>
<p>Sa gunan samatityaitan brahma-bhuyaya kalpate: one who is engaged in devotional service has already been freed from the reactions of his material karma, and thus he immediately becomes brahma-bhuta, or transcendental.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.21).</p>
<p>Ksiyante casya karmani: before attaining the stage of love, one becomes free from all the results of karma.</p>
<p>The Lord is very kind and affectionate toward His devotees, and therefore a devotee, in any condition, is not subjected to the results of karma.</p>
<p>A devotee never aspires for the heavenly planets.</p>
<p>The heavenly planets, liberation and hell are nondifferent for a devotee, for he does not discriminate between different positions in the material world.</p>
<p>A devotee is always eager to return home, back to Godhead, and remain there as the Lord’s associate.</p>
<p>This ambition becomes increasingly fervent in his heart, and therefore he does not care about material changes in his life.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura comments that Maharaja Citraketu’s being cursed by Parvati should be considered the mercy of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord wanted Citraketu to return to Godhead as soon as possible, and therefore he terminated all the reactions of his past deeds.</p>
<p>Acting through the heart of Parvati, the Lord, who is situated in everyone’s heart, cursed Citraketu in order to end all his material reactions.</p>
<p>Thus Citraketu became Vrtrasura in his next life and returned home, back to Godhead.</p>

<p>If one falls into a mine of salt, he tastes only salt wherever he goes.</p>
<p>Similarly, this material world is full of miseries.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The question may be raised why the living entities are situated in different conditions and who has arranged this.</p>
<p>The answer is that it has been done by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without anyone’s help.</p>
<p>The Lord has His own energies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate), and one of them, namely the external energy, creates the material world and the varieties of happiness and distress for the conditioned souls under the supervision of the Lord.</p>
<p>The material world consists of three modes of material nature—sattva-guna, rajo-guna and tamo-guna.</p>
<p>By sattva-guna the Lord maintains the material world, by rajo-guna He creates it, and by tamo-guna He annihilates it.</p>
<p>After the varieties of living entities are created, they are subject to happiness and distress according to their association.</p>
<p>When they are in sattva-guna, the mode of goodness, they feel happiness, when in rajo-guna they are distressed, and when in tamo-guna they have no sense of what to do or what is right and wrong.</p>

<p>Although the Supreme Lord is unattached to our happiness and distress according to karma, and although no one is His enemy or favorite, He creates pious and impious activities through the agency of His material potency.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Although the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate doer of everything, in His original transcendental existence He is not responsible for the happiness and distress, or bondage and liberation, of the conditioned souls.</p>
<p>These are due to the results of the fruitive activities of the living entities within this material world.</p>
<p>By the order of a judge, one person is released from jail, and another is imprisoned, but the judge is not responsible, for the distress and happiness of these different people is due to their own activities.</p>
<p>Although the government is ultimately the supreme authority, the justice is administered by the departments of the government, and the government is not responsible for the individual judgments.</p>
<p>Therefore the government is equal to all the citizens.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Supreme Lord is neutral to everyone, but for the maintenance of law and order His supreme government has various departments, which control the activities of the living entities.</p>
<p>Another example given in this regard is that lilies open or close because of the sunshine, and thus the bumblebees enjoy or suffer, but the sunshine and the sun globe are not responsible for the happiness and distress of the bumblebees.</p>

<p>They do not mind reverses in life because in the service of Narayana they have learned to tolerate whatever hardships there may be.</p>
<p>They do not care whether they are in heaven or in hell: they simply engage in the service of the Lord.</p>
<p>This is their excellence.</p>
<p>Anukulyena krsnanusilanam: they are liberally engaged in the service of the Lord, and therefore they are excellent.</p>
<p>By using the word bhrtya-bhrtyanam, Lord Siva pointed out that although Citraketu provided one example of tolerance and excellence, all the devotees who have taken shelter of the Lord as eternal servants are glorious.</p>
<p>They have no eagerness to be happy by being placed in the heavenly planets, becoming liberated or becoming one with Brahman, the supreme effulgence.</p>
<p>These benefits do not appeal to their minds.</p>
<p>They are simply interested in giving direct service to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>SYNONYMS</strong></p>
<p>dehinam—of all those who have accepted material bodies; deha-samyogat—because of contact with the material body; dvandvani—dualities; isvara-lilaya—by the supreme will of the Lord; sukham—happiness; duhkham—distress; mrtih—death; janma—birth; sapah—curse; anugrahah—favor; eva—certainly; ca—and.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Because of the actions of the Supreme Lord’s external energy, the living entities are conditioned in contact with material bodies.</p>
<p>The dualities of happiness and distress, birth and death, curses and favors, are natural by-products of this contact in the material world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita we find, mayadhyaksena prakrtih suyate sa-caracaram: (Bg.9.10) the material world works under the direction of the goddess Durga, the material energy of the Lord, but she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.44):</p>
<p>srsti-sthiti-pralaya-sadhana-saktir eka</p>
<p>chayeva yasya bhuvanani bibharti durga</p>
<p>Durga—the goddess Parvati, the wife of Lord Siva—is extremely powerful.</p>
<p>She can create, maintain and annihilate any number of universes by her sweet will, but she acts under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, not independently.</p>
<p>Krsna is impartial, but because this is the material world of duality, such relative terms as happiness and distress, curses and favors, are created by the will of the Supreme.</p>
<p>Those who are not narayana-para, pure devotees, must be disturbed by this duality of the material world, whereas devotees who are simply attached to the service of the Lord are not at all disturbed by it.</p>
<p>For example, Haridasa Thakura was beaten with cane in twenty-two bazaars, but he was never disturbed; instead, he smilingly tolerated the beating.</p>
<p>Despite the disturbing dualities of the material world, devotees are not disturbed at all.</p>
<p>Because they fix their minds on the lotus feet of the Lord and concentrate on the holy name of the Lord, they do not feel the so-called pains and pleasures caused by the dualities of this material world.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>As one mistakenly considers a flower garland to be a snake or experiences happiness and distress in a dream, so, in the material world, by a lack of careful consideration, we differentiate between happiness and distress, considering one good and the other bad.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The happiness and distress of the material world of duality are both mistaken ideas.</p>
<p>In the Caitanya-caritamrta (Antya4.176) it is said:</p>
<p>”dvait bhadrabhadra-jnana, saba—manodharm</p>
<p>”ei bhala, ei mand,——ei sababhram The distinctions between happiness and distress in the material world of duality are simply mental concoctions, for the so-called happiness and distress are actually one and the same.</p>
<p>They are like the happiness and distress in dreams.</p>
<p>A sleeping man creates his happiness and distress by dreaming, although actually they have no existence.</p>
<p>The other example given in this verse is that a flower garland is originally very nice, but by mistake, for want of mature knowledge, one may consider it a snake.</p>
<p>In this connection there is a statement by Prabodhananda Sarasvati: visvam purna-sukhayate.</p>
<p>Everyone in this material world is distressed by miserable conditions, but Srila Prabodhananda Sarasvati says that this world is full of happiness.</p>
<p>How is this possible? He answers, yat-karunya-kataksa-vaibhavavatam tam gauram eva stumah.</p>
<p>A devotee accepts the distress of this material world as happiness only due to the causeless mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
<p>By His personal behavior, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu showed that He was never distressed but always happy in chanting the Hare Krsna maha-mantra.</p>
<p>One should follow in the footsteps of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and engage constantly in chanting the maha-mantra—Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>
<p>Then he will never feel the distresses of the world of duality.</p>
<p>In any condition of life one will be happy if he chants the holy name of the Lord.</p>
<p>In dreams we sometimes enjoy eating sweet rice and sometimes suffer as if one of our beloved family members had died.</p>
<p>Because the same mind and body exist in the same material world of duality when we are awake, the so-called happiness and distress of this world are no better than the false, superficial happiness of dreams.</p>
<p>The mind is the via medium in both dreams and wakefulness, and everything created by the mind in terms of sankalpa and vikalpa, acceptance and rejection, is called manodharma, or mental concoction.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Persons engaged in devotional service to Lord Vasudeva, Krsna, have naturally perfect knowledge and detachment from this material world.</p>
<p>Therefore such devotees are not interested in the so-called happiness or so-called distress of this world.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Here is the distinction between a devotee and a philosopher who speculates on the subject matter of transcendence.</p>
<p>A devotee does not need to cultivate knowledge to understand the falsity or temporary existence of this material world.</p>
<p>Because of his unalloyed devotion to Vasudeva, this knowledge and detachment are automatically manifested in his person.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.7):</p>
<p>vasudeve bhagavati</p>
<p>bhakti-yogah prayojitah</p>
<p>janayaty asu vairagyam</p>
<p>jnanam ca yad ahaitukam</p>
<p>One who engages in unalloyed devotional service to Vasudeva, Krsna, automatically becomes aware of this material world, and therefore he is naturally detached.</p>
<p>This detachment is possible because of his high standard of knowledge.</p>
<p>The speculative philosopher tries to understand that this material world is false by cultivating knowledge, but this understanding is automatically manifested in the person of a devotee, without separate endeavor.</p>
<p>The Mayavadi philosophers may be very proud of their so-called knowledge, but because they do not understand Vasudeva (vasudevah sarvam iti (Bg.7.19)), they do not understand the world of duality, which is a manifestation of Vasudeva’s external energy.</p>
<p>Therefore, unless the so-called jnanis take shelter of Vasudeva, their speculative knowledge is imperfect.</p>
<p>Ye ’nye ’ravindaksa vimukta-maninah.</p>
<p>They simply think of becoming free from the contamination of the material world, but because they do not take shelter at the lotus feet of Vasudeva, their knowledge is impure.</p>
<p>When they actually become pure, they surrender to the lotus feet of Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Absolute Truth is easier to understand for a devotee than for jnanis who simply speculate to understand Vasudeva.</p>
<p>Lord Siva confirms this statement in the following verse.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Brahma-samhita (5.33) states:</p>

<p>I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, who is the original person.</p>
<p>He is absolute, infallible and beginningless, and although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original person, the oldest person, who always appears as a fresh youth.</p>
<p>The eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord can not be understood even by the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees Lord Siva places himself as one of the nondevotees, who cannot understand the identity of the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord, being ananta, has an unlimited number of forms.</p>
<p>Therefore, how is it possible for an ordinary, common man to understand Him? Lord Siva, of course, is above the ordinary human beings, yet be is unable to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Lord Siva is not among the ordinary living entities, nor is he in the category of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>He is between Lord Visnu and the common living entity.</p>

<p>Therefore, no one should be astonished to see the activities of the most exalted devotees of Narayana, for they are free from attachment and envy.</p>
<p>They are always peaceful, and they are equal to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>It is said, vaisnavera kriya, mudra vijneha na bujhaya: one should not be astonished to see the activities of exalted, liberated Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>As one should not be misled by the activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one should also not be misled by the activities of His devotees.</p>
<p>Both the Lord and His devotees are liberated.</p>
<p>They are on the same platform, the only difference being that the Lord is the master and the devotees are servants.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, they are one and the same.</p>
<p>In Bhagavad-gita (9.29) the Lord says:</p>
<p>samo ’ham sarva-bhutesu</p>
<p>na me dvesyo ’sti na priyah</p>
<p>ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya</p>
<p>mayi te tesu capy aham</p>
<p>I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone.</p>
<p>I am equal to all.</p>
<p>But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him From this statement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is clear that the devotees of the Lord are always extremely dear to Him.</p>
<p>In effect, Lord Siva told Parvati, Both Citraketu and I are always very dear to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>In other words, both he and I are on the same level as servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>We are always friends, and sometimes we enjoy joking words between us.</p>
<p>When Citraketu loudly laughed at my behavior, he did so on friendly terms, and therefore there was no reason to curse him Thus Lord Siva tried to convince his wife, Parvati, that her cursing of Citraketu was not very sensible.</p>
<p>Here is a difference between male and female that exists even in the higher statuses of life—in fact, even between Lord Siva and his wife.</p>
<p>Lord Siva could understand Citraketu very nicely, but Parvati could not.</p>
<p>Thus even in the higher statuses of life there is a difference between the understanding of a male and that of a female.</p>
<p>It may be clearly said that the understanding of a woman is always inferior to the understanding of a man.</p>
<p>In the Western countries there is now agitation to the effect that man and woman should be considered equal, but from this verse it appears that woman is always less intelligent than man.</p>
<p>It is clear that Citraketu wanted to criticize the behavior of his friend Lord Siva because Lord Siva was sitting with his wife on his lap.</p>
<p>Then, too, Lord Siva wanted to criticize Citraketu for externally posing as a great devotee but being interested in enjoying with the Vidyadhari women.</p>
<p>These were all friendly jokes; there was nothing serious for which Citraketu should have been cursed by Parvati.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the instructions of Lord Siva, Parvati must have been very much ashamed for cursing Citraketu to become a demon.</p>
<p>Mother Parvati could not appreciate Citraketu’s position, and therefore she cursed him, but when she understood the instructions of Lord Siva she was ashamed.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>The great devotee Citraketu was so powerful that he was quite competent to curse mother Parvati in retaliation, but instead of doing so he very humbly accepted the curse and bowed his head before Lord Siva and his wife.</p>
<p>This is very much to be appreciated as the standard behavior of a Vaisnava.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Upon being informed by Lord Siva, mother Parvati could understand that she was wrong in cursing Citraketu.</p>
<p>King Citraketu was so exalted in his character that in spite of being wrongly cursed by Parvati, he immediately descended from his airplane and bowed his head before the mother, accepting her curse.</p>
<p>This has already been explained: narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati.</p>
<p>Citraketu very sportingly felt that since the mother wanted to curse him, he could accept this curse just to please her.</p>
<p>This is called sadhu-laksanam, the characteristic of a sadhu, or a devotee.</p>
<p>As explained by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, trnad api sunicena taror api sahisnuna.</p>
<p>A devotee should always be very humble and meek and should offer all respect to others, especially to superiors.</p>
<p>Being protected by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee is always powerful, but a devotee does not wish to show his power unnecessarily.</p>
<p>However, when a less intelligent person has some power, he wants to use it for sense gratification.</p>
<p>This is not the behavior of a devotee.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-17" id="summary-17">Summary</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#618-1" id="618-1">6.18</a></h3>
<p>This chapter gives the history of Diti, the wife of Kasyapa, and how she followed a vow to have a son who would kill Indra.</p>
<p>It also describes how Indra attempted to foil her plan by cutting to pieces the son within her womb.</p>
<p>In relation to Tvasta and his descendants, there is a description of the dynasty of the Adityas (sons of Aditi) and other demigods.</p>
<p>Prsni, the wife of Aditi’s fifth son named Savita, had three daughters—Savitri, Vyahrti and Trayi—and very exalted sons named Agnihotra, Pasu, Soma, Caturmasya and the five Mahayajnas.</p>
<p>Siddhi, the wife of Bhaga, had three sons, named Mahima, Vibhu and Prabhu, and she also had one daughter, whose name was Asi.</p>
<p>Dhata had four wives—Kuhu, Sinivali, Raka and Anumati—who had four sons, named Sayam, Darsa, Pratah and Purnamasa respectively.</p>
<p>Kriya, the wife of Vidhata, gave birth to the five Purisyas, who are representatives of five kinds of fire-gods.</p>
<p>Bhrgu, the mind-born son of Brahma, took his birth again from Carsani, the wife of Varuna, and the great sage Valmiki appeared from Varuna’s semen.</p>
<p>Agastya and Vasistha were two sons of Varuna and Mitra.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the beauty of Urvasi, Mitra and Varuna discharged semen, which they kept in an earthen pot.</p>
<p>From that pot, Agastya and Vasistha appeared.</p>
<p>Mitra had a wife named Revati, who gave birth to three sons—Utsarga, Arista and Pippala.</p>
<p>Aditi had twelve sons, of whom Indra was the eleventh.</p>
<p>Indra’s wife was named Paulomi (Sacidevi).</p>
<p>She gave birth to three sons—Jayanta, Rsabha and Midhusa.</p>
<p>By His own powers, the Supreme Personality of Godhead appeared as Vamanadeva.</p>
<p>From His wife, whose name was Kirti, appeared a son named Brhatsloka.</p>
<p>Brhatsloka’s first son was known as Saubhaga.</p>
<p>This is a description of the sons of Aditi.</p>
<p>A description of Aditya Urukrama, who is an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, will be offered in the Eighth Canto.</p>
<p>The demons born of Diti are also described in this chapter.</p>
<p>In the dynasty of Diti appeared the great saintly devotee Prahlada and also Bali, Prahlada’s grandson.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa were the first sons of Diti.</p>
<p>Hiranyakasipu and his wife, whose name was Kayadhu, had four sons—Samhlada, Anuhlada, Hlada and Prahlada.</p>
<p>They also had one daughter, whose name was Simhika.</p>
<p>In association with the demon Vipracit, Simhika bore a son named Rahu, whose head was severed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>Krti, the wife of Samhlada, bore a son named Pancajana.</p>
<p>Hlada’s wife, whose name was Dhamani, gave birth to two sons—Vatapi and Ilvala.</p>
<p>Ilvala put Vatapi into the form of a ram and gave him to Agastya to eat.</p>
<p>Anuhlada, in the womb of his wife, Surya, begot two sons, named Baskala and Mahisa.</p>
<p>Prahlada’s son was known as Virocana, and his grandson was known as Bali Maharaja.</p>
<p>Bali Maharaja had one hundred sons, of whom Bana was the eldest.</p>
<p>After describing the dynasty of the Adityas and the other demigods, Sukadeva Gosvami describes Diti’s sons known as the Maruts and how they were elevated to the position of demigods.</p>
<p>Just to help Indra, Lord Visnu had killed Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p>Because of this, Diti was very envious, and she was eager to have a son who could kill Indra.</p>
<p>By her service, she enchanted Kasyapa Muni in order to beg from him a greater son to do this.</p>
<p>In corroboration of the Vedic injunction vidvamsam api karsati, Kasyapa Muni was attracted to his beautiful wife and promised to grant her any request.</p>
<p>When, however, she requested a son who would kill Indra, he condemned himself, and he advised his wife Diti to follow the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies to purify herself.</p>
<p>When Diti, following the instructions of Kasyapa, engaged in devotional service, Indra could understand her purpose, and he began observing all her activities.</p>
<p>One day, Indra had the opportunity to see her deviating from devotional service.</p>
<p>Thus he entered her womb and cut her son into forty-nine parts.</p>
<p>In this way the forty-nine kinds of air known as the Maruts appeared, but because Diti had performed the Vaisnava ritualistic ceremonies, all the sons became Vaisnavas.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Sri Suta Gosvami said: O great sage Saunaka, after hearing Maharaja Pariksit speak respectfully and briefly on topics essential to hear, Sukadeva Gosvami, who was well aware of everything, praised his endeavor with great pleasure and replied.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Maharaja Pariksit’s question was very much appreciated by Sukadeva Gosvami because although it was composed of a small number of words, it contained meaningful inquiries about how the sons of Diti, although born as demons, became demigods.</p>
<p>Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura stresses that even though Diti was very envious, her heart was purified because of a devotional attitude.</p>
<p>Another significant topic is that although Kasyapa Muni was a learned scholar and was advanced in spiritual consciousness, he nonetheless fell a victim to the inducement of his beautiful wife.</p>
<p>All these questions were posed in a small number of words, and therefore Sukadeva Gosvami very much appreciated Maharaja Pariksit’s inquiry.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Thinking in this way (with a desire for a son to kill Indra), Diti began constantly acting to satisfy Kasyapa by her pleasing behavior.</p>
<p>O King, Diti always carried out Kasyapa’s orders very faithfully, as he desired.</p>
<p>With service, love, humility and control, with words spoken very sweetly to satisfy her husband, and with smiles and glances at him, Diti attracted his mind and brought it under her control.</p>

<p>When a woman wants to endear herself to her husband and make him very faithful, she must try to please him in all respects.</p>
<p>When the husband is pleased with his wife, the wife can receive all necessities, ornaments and full satisfaction for her senses.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning of creation, Lord Brahma, the father of the living entities of the universe, saw that all the living entities were unattached.</p>
<p>To increase population, he then created woman from the better half of man’s body, for woman’s behavior carries away a man’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>This entire universe is going on under the spell of sexual attachment, which was created by Lord Brahma to increase the population of the entire universe, not only in human society but also in other species.</p>
<p>As stated by Rsabhadeva in the Fifth Canto, pumsah striya mithuni-bhavam etam: the entire world is going on under the spell of sexual attraction and desire between man and woman.</p>
<p>When man and woman unite, the hard knot of this attraction becomes increasingly tight, and thus a man is implicated in the materialistic way of life.</p>
<p>This is the illusion of the material world.</p>
<p>This illusion acted upon Kasyapa Muni, although he was very learned and advanced in spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (9.19.17) :</p>
<p>matra svasra duhitra va</p>
<p>naviviktasano bhavet</p>
<p>balavan indriya-gramo</p>
<p>vidvamsam api karsati</p>
<p>A man should not associate with a woman in a solitary place, not even with his mother, sister or daughter, for the senses are so strong that they lead astray even a person advanced in knowledge When a man remains in a solitary place with a woman, his sexual desires undoubtedly increase.</p>
<p>Therefore the words ekanta-bhutani, which are used here, indicate that to avoid sexual desires one should avoid the company of women as far as possible.</p>
<p>Sexual desire is so powerful that one is saturated with it if he stays in a solitary place with any woman, even his mother, sister or daughter.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A husband is the supreme demigod for a woman.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Vasudeva, the husband of the goddess of fortune, is situated in everyone’s heart and is worshiped through the various names and forms of the demigods by fruitive workers.</p>
<p>Similarly, a husband represents the Lord as the object of worship for a woman.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord says in Bhagavad-gita (9.23):</p>
<p>ye ’py anya-devata-bhakta</p>
<p>yajante sraddhayanvitah</p>
<p>te ’pi mam eva kaunteya</p>
<p>yajanty avidhi-purvakam</p>
<p>Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kunti, is really meant for Me alone, but it is offered without true understanding The demigods are various assistants who act like the hands and legs of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>One who is not in direct touch with the Supreme Lord and cannot conceive of the exalted position of the Lord is sometimes advised to worship the demigods as various parts of the Lord.</p>
<p>If women, who are usually very much attached to their husbands, worship their husbands as representatives of Vasudeva, the women benefit, just as Ajamila benefited by calling for Narayana, his son.</p>
<p>Ajamila was concerned with his son, but because of his attachment to the name of Narayana, he attained salvation simply by chanting that name.</p>
<p>In India a husband is still called pati-guru, the husband spiritual master.</p>
<p>If husband and wife are attached to one another for advancement in Krsna consciousness, their relationship of cooperation is very effective for such advancement.</p>
<p>Although the names of Indra and Agni are sometimes uttered in the Vedic mantras (indraya svaha, agnaye svaha), the Vedic sacrifices are actually performed for the satisfaction of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>As long as one is very much attached to material sense gratification, the worship of the demigods or the worship of one’s husband is recommended.</p>

<p>Diti replied: O my husband, O great soul, I have now lost my sons.</p>
<p>If you want to give me a benediction, I ask you for an immortal son who can kill Indra.</p>
<p>I pray for this because Indra, with the help of Visnu, has killed my two sons Hiranyaksa and Hiranyakasipu.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word indra-hanam means one who can kill Indra but it also means one who follows Indra The word amrtyum refers to the demigods, who do not die like ordinary human beings because they have extremely long durations of life.</p>
<p>For example, the duration of Lord Brahma’s life is stated in Bhagavad-gita: sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmano viduh (Bg.8.17).</p>
<p>Even the duration of one day, or twelve hours, of Brahma is 4,300,000 years multiplied by one thousand.</p>
<p>Thus the duration of his life is inconceivable for an ordinary human being.</p>
<p>The demigods are therefore sometimes called amara, which means one who has no death In this material world, however, everyone has to die.</p>
<p>Therefore the word amrtyum indicates that Diti wanted a son who would be equal in status to the demigods.</p>

<p>But I am a man.</p>
<p>Therefore, all condemnation upon me! I am not at all conversant with what is good for me, since I could not control my senses.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The natural instinct of a woman is to enjoy the material world.</p>
<p>She induces her husband to enjoy this world by satisfying his tongue, belly and genitals, which are called jihva, udara and upastha.</p>
<p>A woman is expert in cooking palatable dishes so that she can easily satisfy her husband in eating.</p>
<p>When one eats nicely, his belly is satisfied, and as soon as the belly is satisfied the genitals become strong.</p>
<p>Especially when a man is accustomed to eating meat and drinking wine and similar passionate things, he certainly becomes sexually inclined.</p>
<p>It should be understood that sexual inclinations are meant not for spiritual progress but for gliding down to hell.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni considered his situation and lamented.</p>
<p>In other words, to be a householder is very risky unless one is trained and the wife is a follower of her husband.</p>
<p>A husband should be trained at the very beginning of his life.</p>
<p>Kaumara acaret prajno dharman bhagavatan iha (Bhag.7.6.1).</p>
<p>During the time of brahmacarya, or student life, a brahmacari should be taught to be expert in bhagavata-dharma, devotional service.</p>
<p>Then when he marries, if his wife is faithful to her husband and follows him in such life, the relationship between husband and wife is very desirable.</p>
<p>However, a relationship between husband and wife without spiritual consciousness but strictly for sense gratification is not at all good.</p>
<p>Srimad-Bhagavatam (12.2.3) that especially in this age, Kali-yuga, dam-patye ’bhirucir hetuh: the relationship between husband and wife will be based on sexual power.</p>
<p>Therefore householder life in this Kali-yuga is extremely dangerous unless both the wife and husband take to Krsna consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>A woman’s face is as attractive and beautiful as a blossoming lotus flower during autumn.</p>
<p>Her words are very sweet, and they give pleasure to the ear, but if we study a woman’s heart, we can understand it to be extremely sharp, like the blade of a razor.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, who could understand the dealings of a woman?</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Woman is now depicted very well from the materialistic point of view by Kasyapa Muni.</p>
<p>Women are generally known as the fair sex, and especially in youth, at the age of sixteen or seventeen, women are very attractive to men.</p>
<p>Therefore a woman’s face is compared to a blooming lotus flower in autumn.</p>
<p>Just as a lotus is extremely beautiful in autumn, a woman at the threshold of youthful beauty is extremely attractive.</p>
<p>In Sanskrit a woman’s voice is called nari-svara because women generally sing and their singing is very attractive.</p>
<p>At the present moment, cinema artists, especially female singers, are especially welcome.</p>
<p>Some of them earn fabulous amounts of money simply by singing.</p>
<p>Therefore, as taught by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, a woman’s singing is dangerous because it can make a sannyasi fall a victim to the woman.</p>
<p>Sannyasa means giving up the company of women, but if a sannyasi hears the voice of a woman and sees her beautiful face, he certainly becomes attracted and is sure to fall down.</p>
<p>There have been many examples.</p>
<p>Even the great sage Visvamitra fell a victim to Menaka.</p>
<p>Therefore a person desiring to advance in spiritual consciousness must be especially careful not to see a woman’s face or hear a woman’s voice.</p>
<p>To see a woman’s face and appreciate its beauty or to hear a woman’s voice and appreciate her singing as very nice is a subtle falldown for a brahmacari or sannyasi.</p>
<p>Thus the description of a woman’s features by Kasyapa Muni is very instructive.</p>
<p>When a woman’s bodily features are attractive, when her face is beautiful and when her voice is sweet, she is naturally a trap for a man.</p>
<p>The sastras advise that when such a woman comes to serve a man, she should be considered to be like a dark well covered by grass.</p>
<p>In the fields there are many such wells, and a man who does not know about them drops through the grass and falls down.</p>
<p>Thus there are many such instructions.</p>
<p>Since the attraction of the material world is based on attraction for women, Kasyapa Muni thought, Under the circumstances, who can understand the heart of a woman Canakya Pandita has also advised, visvaso naiva kartavyah strisu raja-kulesu ca: There are two persons one should not trust—a politician and a woman These, of course, are authoritative sastric injunctions, and we should therefore be very careful in our dealings with women.</p>
<p>Sometimes our Krsna consciousness movement is criticized for mingling men and women, but Krsna consciousness is meant for anyone.</p>
<p>Whether one is a man or woman does not matter.</p>
<p>Lord Krsna personally says, striyo vaisyas tatha sudras te ’pi yanti param gatim: whether one is a woman, sudra or vaisya, not to speak of being a brahmana or ksatriya, everyone is fit to return home, back to Godhead, if he strictly follows the instructions of the spiritual master and sastra.</p>
<p>We therefore request all the members of the Krsna consciousness movement—both men and women—not to be attracted by bodily features but only to be attracted by Krsna.</p>
<p>Then everything will be all right.</p>
<p>Otherwise there will be danger.</p>

<p>na—not; hi—certainly; kascit—anyone; priyah—dear; strinam—to women; anjasa—actually; sva-asisa—for their own interests; atmanam—most dear; patim—husband; putram—son; bhrataram—brother; va—or; ghnanti—they kill; arthe—for their own interests; ghatayanti—cause to be killed; ca—also.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>To satisfy their own interests, women deal with men as if the men were most dear to them, but no one is actually dear to them.</p>
<p>Women are supposed to be very saintly, but for their own interests they can kill even their husbands, sons or brothers, or cause them to be killed by others.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>A woman’s nature has been particularly well studied by Kasyapa Muni.</p>
<p>Women are self-interested by nature, and therefore they should be protected by all means so that their natural inclination to be too self-interested will not be manifested.</p>
<p>Women need to be protected by men.</p>
<p>A woman should be cared for by her father in her childhood, by her husband in her youth and by her grown sons in her old age.</p>
<p>This is the injunction of Manu, who says that a woman should not be given independence at any stage.</p>
<p>Women must be cared for so that they will not be free to manifest their natural tendency for gross selfishness.</p>
<p>There have been many cases, even in the present day, in which women have killed their husbands to take advantage of their insurance policies.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of women but a practical study of their nature.</p>
<p>Such natural instincts of a woman or a man are manifested only in the bodily conception of life.</p>
<p>When either a man or a woman is advanced in spiritual consciousness, the bodily conception of life practically vanishes.</p>
<p>We should see all women as spiritual units (aham brahmasmi), whose only duty is to satisfy Krsna.</p>
<p>Then the influences of the different modes of material nature, which result from one’s possessing a material body, will not act.</p>
<p>The Krsna consciousness movement is so beneficial that it can very easily counteract the contamination of material nature, which results from one’s possessing a material body.Bhagavad-gita therefore teaches, in the very beginning, that whether one is a man or a woman, one must know that he or she is not the body but a spiritual soul.</p>
<p>Everyone should be interested in the activities of the spirit soul, not the body.</p>
<p>As long as one is activated by the bodily conception of life, there is always the danger of being misled, whether one is a man or a woman.</p>
<p>The soul is sometimes described as purusa because whether one is dressed as a man or a woman, one is inclined to enjoy this material world.</p>
<p>One who has this spirit of enjoyment is described as purusa.</p>
<p>Whether one is a man or a woman, he is not interested in serving others; everyone is interested in satisfying his or her own senses.</p>
<p>Krsna consciousness, however, provides first-class training for a man or a woman.</p>
<p>A man should be trained to be a first-class devotee of Lord Krsna, and a woman should be trained to be a very chaste follower of her husband.</p>
<p>That will make the lives of both of them happy.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>I promised to give her a benediction, and this promise cannot be violated, but Indra does not deserve to be killed.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, the solution I have is quite suitable.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni concluded, Diti is eager to have a son who can kill Indra, since she is a woman, after all, and is not very intelligent.</p>
<p>I shall train her in such a way that instead of always thinking of how to kill Indra, she will become a Vaisnava, a devotee of Krsna.</p>
<p>If she agrees to follow the rules and regulations of the Vaisnava principles, the unclean core of her heart will certainly be cleansed Ceto-darpana-marjanam (Cc.Antya 20.12).</p>
<p>This is the process of devotional service.</p>
<p>Anyone can be purified by following the principles of devotional service in Krsna consciousness, for Krsna consciousness is so powerful that it can purify even the dirtiest class of men and transform them into the topmost Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu’s movement aims at this purpose.</p>
<p>Narottama dasa Thakura says:</p>
<p>balarama ha-ila nitai</p>
<p>ta’ra saksi jagai-madhai</p>
<p>The appearance of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu in this Kali-yuga is especially meant to deliver the fallen souls, who are always planning something for material enjoyment.</p>
<p>He gave the people of this age the advantage of being able to chant the Hare Krsna mantra and thus become fully pure, free from all material contamination.</p>
<p>Once one becomes a pure Vaisnava, he transcends all material conceptions of life.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni tried to transform his wife into a Vaisnavi so that she might give up the idea of killing Indra.</p>
<p>He wanted both her and her sons to be purified so that they would be fit to become pure Vaisnavas.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes a practitioner deviates from the Vaisnava principles, and there is a chance that he may fall down, but Kasyapa Muni thought that even if one falls while practicing the Vaisnava principles, he is still not a loser.</p>
<p>Even a fallen Vaisnava is eligible for better results, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat: even practicing the Vaisnava principles to a small extent can save one from the greatest danger of material existence.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni planned to instruct his wife Diti to become a Vaisnava because he wanted to save the life of Indra.</p>

<p>sri-kasyapah uvaca—Kasyapa Muni said; putrah—son; te—your; bhavita—will be; bhadre—O gentle woman; indra-ha—killer of Indra, or follower of Indra; adeva-bandhavah—friend of the demons (or deva-bandhavah—friend of the demigods); samvatsaram—for a year; vratam—vow; idam—this; yadi—if; anjah—properly; dharayisyasi—you will execute.</p>
<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni said: My dear gentle wife, if you follow my instructions regarding this vow for at least one year, you will surely get a son who will be able to kill Indra.</p>
<p>However, if you deviate from this vow of following the Vaisnava principles, you will get a son who will be favorable to Indra.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The word indra-ha refers to an asura who is always eager to kill Indra.</p>
<p>An enemy of Indra is naturally a friend to the asuras, but the word indra-ha also refers to one who follows Indra or who is obedient to him.</p>
<p>When one becomes a devotee of Indra, he is certainly a friend to the demigods.</p>
<p>Thus the words indra-hadeva-bandhavah are equivocal, for they say, Your son will kill Indra, but he will be very friendly to the demigods If a person actually became a friend of the demigods, he certainly would not be able to kill Indra.</p>

<p>Diti replied: My dear brahmana, I must accept your advice and follow the vow.</p>
<p>Now let me understand what I have to do, what is forbidden and what will not break the vow.</p>
<p>Please clearly state all this to me.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>As stated above, a woman is generally inclined to serve her own purposes.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni proposed to train Diti to fulfill her desires within one year, and since she was eager to kill Indra, she immediately agreed, saying, Please let me know what the vow is and how I have to follow it.</p>
<p>I promise that I shall do the needful and not break the vow This is another side of a woman’s psychology.</p>
<p>Even though a woman is very fond of fulfilling her own plans, when someone instructs her, especially her husband, she innocently follows, and thus she can be trained for better purposes.</p>
<p>By nature a woman wants to be a follower of a man; therefore if the man is good the woman can be trained for a good purpose.</p>

<p>Kasyapa Muni said: My dear wife, to follow this vow, do not be violent or cause harm to anyone.</p>
<p>Do not curse anyone, and do not speak lies.</p>
<p>Do not cut your nails and hair, and do not touch impure things like skulls and bones.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni’s first instruction to his wife was not to be envious.</p>
<p>The general tendency of anyone within this material world is to be envious, and therefore, to become a Krsna conscious person, one must curb this tendency, as stated in Srimad-Bhagavatam (paramo nirmatsaranam).</p>
<p>A Krsna conscious person is always nonenvious, whereas others are always envious.</p>
<p>Thus Kasyapa Muni’s instruction that his wife not be envious indicates that this is the first stage of advancement in Krsna consciousness.</p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni desired to train his wife to be a Krsna conscious person, for this would suffice to protect both her and Indra.</p>

<p>Generally the goddess Kali is offered food containing meat and fish, and therefore Kasyapa Muni strictly forbade his wife to take the remnants of such food.</p>
<p>Actually a Vaisnava is not allowed to take any food offered to the demigods.</p>
<p>A Vaisnava is always fixed in accepting prasada offered to Lord Visnu.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Kasyapa Muni advised his wife not to go out onto the street unless she was well decorated and well dressed.</p>
<p>He did not encourage the miniskirts that have now become fashionable.</p>
<p>In Oriental civilization, when a woman goes out onto the street, she must be fully covered so that no man will recognize who she is.</p>
<p>All these methods are to be accepted for purification.</p>
<p>If one takes to Krsna consciousness, one is fully purified, and thus one remains always transcendental to the contamination of the material world.</p>

<p>Putting on washed clothing, being always pure and being adorned with turmeric, sandalwood pulp and other auspicious items, before breakfast one should worship the cows, the brahmanas, the goddess of fortune and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>If one is trained to honor and worship the cows and brahmanas, he is actually civilized.</p>
<p>The worship of the Supreme Lord is recommended, and the Lord is very fond of the cows and brahmanas (namo brahmanya-devaya go-brahmana-hitaya ca).</p>
<p>In other words, a civilization in which there is no respect for the cows and brahmanas is condemned.</p>
<p>One cannot become spiritually advanced without acquiring the brahminical qualifications and giving protection to cows.</p>
<p>Cow protection insures sufficient food prepared with milk, which is needed for an advanced civilization.</p>
<p>One should not pollute civilization by eating the flesh of cows.</p>
<p>A civilization must do something progressive, and then it is an Aryan civilization.</p>
<p>Instead of killing the cow to eat flesh, civilized men must prepare various milk products that will enhance the condition of society.</p>

<p>For one who engages in worshiping Lord Visnu, nothing is very wonderful.</p>

<p>Although those who are interested only in worshiping the Supreme Personality of Godhead do not desire anything material from the Lord and do not even want liberation, Lord Krsna fulfills all their desires.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>When Dhruva Maharaja saw Lord Visnu, he declined to take any benedictions from Him, for he was fully satisfied by seeing the Lord.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Lord is so kind that because Dhruva Maharaja, in the beginning, had desired a kingdom greater than his father’s, he was promoted to Dhruvaloka, the best planet in the universe.</p>
<p>Therefore in the sastra it is said:</p>
<p>akamah sarva-kamo va</p>
<p>moksa-kama udara-dhih</p>
<p>tivrena bhakti-yogena</p>
<p>yajeta purusam param</p>
<p>A person who has broader intelligence, whether he is full of material desires, free from material desires, or desiring liberation, must by all means worship the supreme whole, the Personality of Godhead (Bhag.2.3.10) One should engage in full devotional service.</p>
<p>Then, even though he has no desires, whatever desires he previously had can all be fulfilled simply by his worship of the Lord.</p>
<p>The actual devotee does not desire even liberation (anyabhilasita-sunyam (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)).</p>
<p>The Lord, however, fulfills the desire of the devotee by awarding him opulence that will never be destroyed.</p>
<p>A karmi’s opulence is destroyed, but the opulence of a devotee is never destroyed.</p>
<p>A devotee becomes more and more opulent as he increases his devotional service to the Lord.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#619-1" id="619-1">6.19</a></h3>
<p>This chapter explains how Diti, Kasyapa Muni’s wife, executed Kasyapa Muni’s instructions on devotional service.</p>
<p>During the first day of the bright fortnight of the moon in the month of Agrahayana (November–December), every woman, following in the footsteps of Diti and following the instructions of her own husband, should begin this pumsavana-vrata.</p>
<p>In the morning, after washing her teeth, bathing and thus becoming purified, she should hear about the birth mystery of the Maruts.</p>
<p>Then, covering her body with a white dress and being properly ornamented, before breakfast she should worship Lord Visnu and mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, Lord Visnu’s wife, by glorifying Lord Visnu for His mercy, patience, prowess, ability, greatness and other glories and for how He can bestow all mystic benedictions.</p>
<p>While offering the Lord all paraphernalia for worship, such as ornaments, a sacred thread, scents, nice flowers, incense and water for bathing and washing His feet, hands and mouth, one should invite the Lord with this mantra: om namo bhagavate maha-purusaya mahanubhavaya mahavibhutipataye saha maha-vibhutibhir balim upaharami.</p>
<p>Then one should offer twelve oblations in the fire while chanting this mantra: om namo bhagavate maha-purusaya mahavibhuti-pataye svaha.</p>
<p>One should offer obeisances while chanting this mantra ten times.</p>
<p>Then one should chant the Laksmi-Narayana mantra.</p>
<p>If either a pregnant woman or her husband regularly discharges this devotional service, both of them will receive the result.</p>
<p>After continuing this process for one full year, the chaste wife should fast on the purnima, the full-moon day, of Karttika.</p>
<p>On the following day, the husband should worship the Lord as before and then observe a festival by cooking nice food and distributing prasada to the brahmanas.</p>
<p>Then, with the permission of the brahmanas, the husband and wife should take prasada.</p>
<p>This chapter ends by glorifying the results of the pumsavana function.</p>

<p>(She should then pray to the Lord as follows.)</p>
<p>My dear Lord, You are full in all opulences, but I do not beg You for opulence.</p>
<p>I simply offer my respectful obeisances unto You.</p>
<p>You are the husband and master of Laksmidevi, the goddess of fortune, who has all opulences.</p>
<p>Therefore You are the master of all mystic yoga.</p>

<p>purnat purnam udacyate</p>
<p>purnasya purnam adaya</p>
<p>purnam evavasisyate</p>
<p>(Isopanisad, Invocation)</p>
<p>The personality of Godhead is perfect and complete, and because He is completely perfect, all emanations from Him, such as this phenomenal world, are perfectly equipped as complete wholes.</p>
<p>Whatever is produced of the complete whole is also complete in itself.</p>
<p>Because He is the complete whole, even though so many complete units emanate from Him, He remains the complete balance Therefore, to take shelter of the Supreme Lord is required.</p>
<p>Whatever a devotee needs will be supplied by the complete Supreme Personality of Godhead (tesam nityabhiyuktanam yoga-ksemam vahamy aham (Bg.9.22)).</p>
<p>Therefore a pure devotee will not ask anything from the Lord.</p>
<p>He simply offers the Lord his respectful obeisances, and the Lord is prepared to accept whatever the devotee can secure to worship Him, even patram puspam phalam toyam—a leaf, flower, fruit or water.</p>
<p>There is no need to artificially exert oneself.</p>
<p>It is better to be plain and simple and with respectful obeisances offer to the Lord whatever one can secure.</p>
<p>The Lord is completely able to bless the devotee with all opulences.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>O my Lord, because You are endowed with causeless mercy, all opulences, all prowess and all glories, strength and transcendental qualities, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of everyone.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>In this verse the words tato ’si bhagavan prabhuh mean Therefore You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of everyone The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all six opulences in full, and moreover He is extremely kind to His devotee.</p>
<p>Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless wants all the living entities to surrender unto Him so that they may engage in His service.</p>
<p>Thus He becomes satisfied.</p>
<p>Although He is full in Himself, He nonetheless becomes pleased when His devotee offers Him patram puspam phalam toyam—a leaf, flower, fruit or water—in devotion.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Lord, as the child of mother Yasoda, requests His devotee for some food, as if He were very hungry.</p>
<p>Sometimes He tells His devotee in a dream that His temple and His garden are now very old and that He cannot enjoy them very nicely.</p>
<p>Thus He requests the devotee to repair them.</p>
<p>Sometimes He is buried in the earth, and as if unable to come out Himself, He requests His devotee to rescue Him.</p>
<p>Sometimes He requests His devotee to preach His glories all over the world, although He alone is quite competent to perform this task.</p>
<p>Even though the Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with all possessions and is self-sufficient, He depends on His devotees.</p>
<p>Therefore the relationship of the Lord with His devotees is extremely confidential.</p>
<p>Only the devotee can perceive how the Lord, although full in Himself, depends on His devotee for some particular work.</p>
<p>This is explained in Bhagavad-gita (11.33), where the Lord tells Arjuna, nimitta-matram bhava savyasacin: O Arjuna, merely be an instrument in the fight Lord Krsna had the competence to win the Battle of Kuruksetra, but nonetheless He induced His devotee Arjuna to fight and become the cause of victory.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu was quite competent enough to spread His name and mission all over the world, but still He depended upon His devotee to do this work.</p>
<p>Considering all these points, the most important aspect of the Supreme Lord’s self-sufficiency is that He depends on His devotees.</p>
<p>This is called His causeless mercy.</p>
<p>The devotee who has perceived this causeless mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by realization can understand the master and the servant.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>(After profusely offering obeisances unto Lord Visnu, the devotee should offer respectful obeisances unto mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, and pray as follows.)</p>
<p>O wife of Lord Visnu, O internal energy of Lord Visnu, you are as good as Lord Visnu Himself, for you have all of His qualities and opulences.</p>
<p>O goddess of fortune, please be kind to me.</p>
<p>O mother of the entire world, I offer my respectful obeisances unto you.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>The Lord has multifarious potencies (parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate).</p>
<p>Since mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is the Lord’s very precious potency, she is addressed here as maha-maye.</p>
<p>The word maya means sakti.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu, the Supreme, cannot exhibit His power everywhere without His principal energy.</p>
<p>It is said, sakti saktiman abheda: the power and the powerful are identical.</p>
<p>Therefore mother Laksmi, the goddess of fortune, is the constant companion of Lord Visnu; they remain together constantly.</p>
<p>One cannot keep Laksmi in one’s home without Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>To think that one can do so is very dangerous.</p>
<p>To keep Laksmi, or the riches of the Lord, without the service of the Lord is always dangerous, for then Laksmi becomes the illusory energy.</p>
<p>With Lord Visnu, however, Laksmi is the spiritual energy.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATION</strong></p>
<p>If one desires all opulences, his duty is to daily worship Lord Visnu with His wife, Laksmi.</p>
<p>With great devotion one should worship Him according to the above-mentioned process.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu and the goddess of fortune are an immensely powerful combination.</p>
<p>They are the bestowers of all benedictions and the sources of all good fortune.</p>
<p>Therefore the duty of everyone is to worship Laksmi-Narayana.</p>
<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Laksmi-Narayana—Lord Visnu and mother Laksmi—are always situated in everyone’s heart (isvarah sarva-bhutanam hrd-dese ’rjuna tisthati (Bg.18.61)).</p>
<p>However, because nondevotees do not realize that Lord Visnu stays with His eternal consort, Laksmi, within the hearts of all living entities, they are not endowed with the opulence of Lord Visnu.</p>
<p>Unscrupulous men sometimes address a poor man as daridra-narayana, or poor Narayana This is most unscientific.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu and Laksmi are always situated in everyone’s heart, but this does not mean that everyone is Narayana, especially not those in poverty.</p>
<p>This is a most abominable term to use in connection with Narayana.</p>
<p>Narayana never becomes poor, and therefore He can never be called daridra-narayana.</p>
<p>Narayana is certainly situated in everyone’s heart, but He is neither poor nor rich.</p>

<p><strong>PURPORT</strong></p>
<p>Madhvacarya, the acarya of the Tattvavadis, has described this verse in the following way: Visnu is described as yajna personified, and mother Laksmi is described as spiritual activities and the original form of worship.</p>
<p>In fact, they represent spiritual activities and the Supersoul of all yajna.</p>
<p>Lord Visnu is the Supersoul even of Laksmidevi, but no one can be the Supersoul of Lord Visnu, for Lord Visnu Himself is the spiritual Supersoul of everyone According to Madhvacarya, there are two tattvas, or factors.</p>
<p>One is independent, and the other is dependent.</p>
<p>The first tattva is the Supreme Lord, Visnu, and the second is the jiva-tattva.</p>
<p>Laksmidevi, being dependent on Lord Visnu, is sometimes counted among the jivas.</p>
<p>The Gaudiya Vaisnavas, however, describe Laksmidevi in accordance with the following two verses from the Prameya-ratnavali of Baladeva Vidyabhusana.</p>
<p>The first verse is a quotation from the Visnu Purana nityaiva sa jagan-mata</p>
<p>visnoh srir anapayini</p>
<p>yatha sarva-gato visnus</p>
<p>tathaiveyam dvijottama</p>
<p>visnoh syuh saktayas tisras</p>
<p>tasu ya kirtita para</p>
<p>saiva sris tad-abhinneti</p>
<p>praha sisyan prabhur mahan</p>
<p>O best of the brahmanas, Laksmiji is the constant companion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Visnu, and therefore she is called anapayini.</p>
<p>She is the mother of all creation.</p>
<p>As Lord Visnu is all-pervading, His spiritual potency, mother Laksmi, is also all-pervading Lord Visnu has three principal potencies—internal, external and marginal.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has accepted para-sakti, the spiritual energy of the Lord, as being identical with the Lord.</p>
<p>Thus she is also included in the independent visnu-tattva In the Kanti-mala commentary on the Prameya-ratnavali there is this statement: nanu kvacit nitya-mukta jivatvam laksmyah svikrtam, tatraha—praheti nityaiveti padye sarva-vyapti-kathanena kalakasthety adi-padya-dvaye, suddho ’pity ukta ca mahaprabhuna svasisyan prati laksmya bhagavad-advaitam upadistam kvacid yat tasyas tu dvaitam uktam, tat tu tad-avista-nitya-mukta jivam adaya sangatamas tu Although some authoritative Vaisnava disciplic successions count the goddess of fortune among the ever-liberated living entities (jivas) in Vaikuntha, Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, in accordance with the statement in the Visnu Purana, has described Laksmi as being identical with the visnu-tattva.</p>
<p>The correct conclusion is that the descriptions of Laksmi as being different from Visnu are stated when an eternally liberated living entity is imbued with the quality of Laksmi; they do not pertain to mother Laksmi, the eternal consort of Lord Visnu</p>
