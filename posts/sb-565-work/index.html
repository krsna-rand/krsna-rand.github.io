<h3>Canto 8: Withdrawal of the Cosmic Creation</h3>
<h3>Gajendra’s Prayers of Surrender - Summary</h3>
<h3>8.3</h3>
<p>In this chapter, the prayers by Gajendra, the King of the elephants, are described.</p>
<p>It appears that the King of the elephants was formerly a human being known as Indradyumna and that he learned a prayer to the Supreme Lord.</p>
<p>Fortunately he remembered that prayer and began to chant it to himself.</p>
<p>First he offered his respectful obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and because of his awkward position in having been attacked by the crocodile, he expressed his inability to recite prayers nicely.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>Nonetheless, he tried to chant the mantra and expressed himself in appropriate words as follows:</p>
<p>"The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the cause of all causes, the original person from whom everything has emanated.</p>
<p>He is the root cause of this cosmic manifestation, and the entire cosmos rests in Him, yet He is transcendental, for He does everything in relation to the material world through His external energy.</p>
<p>He is eternally situated in the spiritual world—in Vaikuntha or Goloka Vrndavana—where He engages in His eternal pastimes.</p>
<p>The material world is a product of His external energy, or material nature, which works under His direction.</p>
<p>It is thus that creation, maintenance and annihilation take place.</p>
<p>The Lord exists at all times.</p>
<p>This is extremely difficult for a nondevotee to understand.</p>
<p>Although the transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is perceivable by everyone, only the pure devotees perceive His presence and activities.</p>
<p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely free from material birth, death, old age and disease.</p>
<p>Indeed, if anyone in this material world takes shelter of Him, he also becomes situated in that transcendental position.</p>
<p>For the satisfaction of the devotee (paritranaya sadhunam), the Lord appears and exhibits His activities.</p>
<p>His appearance, disappearance and other pastimes are not at all material.</p>
<p>One who knows this secret can enter the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In the Lord, all opposing elements are adjusted.</p>
<p>The Lord is situated in everyone’s heart.</p>
<p>He is the controller of everything, He is the witness of all activities, and He is the original source of all living entities.</p>
<p>Indeed, all living entities are parts of Him, for He is the origin of Maha-Visnu, who is the source of the living entities within this material world.</p>
<p>The Lord can observe the activities of our senses, which can work and achieve material results because of His mercy.</p>
<p>Although He is the original source of everything, He is untouched by any of His by-products.</p>
<p>In this way He is like a gold mine, which is the source of gold in ornaments and yet is different from the ornaments themselves.</p>
<p>The Lord is worshiped by the method prescribed in the Pancaratras.</p>
<p>He is the source of our knowledge, and He can give us liberation.</p>
<p>Therefore it is our duty to understand Him according to the instructions of devotees, in particular the spiritual master.</p>
<p>Although for us the mode of goodness is covered, by following the instructions of saintly persons and the spiritual master we can be freed from material clutches.</p>
<p>The self-effulgent material form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is adored by nondevotees, His impersonal form is adored by those advanced in spiritual knowledge, and His feature as the localized Supersoul is appreciated by yogis.</p>
<p>But His original form as a person is understood only by devotees.</p>
<p>That Supreme Personality of Godhead is competent to dissipate the darkness of the conditioned soul through His instructions in Bhagavad-gita.</p>
<p>He is the ocean of transcendental qualities and can be understood only by liberated persons freed from the bodily concept of life.</p>
<p>By His causeless mercy, the Lord can rescue the conditioned soul from the material clutches and enable him to return home, back to Godhead, to become His personal associate.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a pure devotee does not aspire to go back to Godhead; he is simply satisfied with executing his service in this material world.</p>
<p>A pure devotee does not ask anything from the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p>
<p>His only prayer is to be freed from the material conception of life and to be engaged in the Lord’s transcendental loving service."</p>
<p>In this way the King of the elephants, Gajendra, offered prayers directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without mistaking Him for one of the demigods.</p>
<p>None of the demigods came to see him, not even Brahma or Siva.</p>
<p>Rather, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, seated on Garuda, personally appeared before him.</p>
<p>Gajendra, by lifting his trunk, offered obeisances to the Lord, and the Lord immediately pulled him from the water along with the crocodile who had captured his leg.</p>
<p>Then the Lord killed the crocodile and thus rescued Gajendra.</p>
